In the sentence, \"The butt was bare, and Sam couldn't stop staring at it. It was very what?\" the most appropriate word is **\"ample\"**, which describes something as generous or abundant in size. However, it's important to note that \"bareword\" is not a standard term, and \"ample\" appears twice in the options, which might be an error."}]
