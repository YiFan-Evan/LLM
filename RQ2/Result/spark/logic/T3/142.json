Stella is a rompus, a zumpus, and a numpus. (Premise 12)\n13. Stella is a sterpus, Stella is not a lorpus, and Stella is a jompus. (Premise 13)\n\nFrom Premise 11, if something is a gorpus, it must be an impus. From Premise 8, if something is an impus, it must be a lorpus, a tumpus, and a grimpus. However, from Premise 13, Stella is not a lorpus. This creates a contradiction because Stella cannot be both an impus (which requires her to be a lorpus) and not a lorpus at the same time.\n\nTherefore, Stella cannot be a gorpus because being a gorpus would require her to be an impus, which in turn requires her to be a lorpus, but she is not a lorpus.\n\nSince Stella is not a gorpus, according to Premise 1, Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThus, we have proven that Taylor is a visionary."}]
