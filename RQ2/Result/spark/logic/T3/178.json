Since every jompus is an impus (from Premise 2 and the fact that all categories mentioned are subsets of each other in a way that includes jompuses within impuses), it follows that Fae, being a jompus, is also an impus and therefore not sunny.\n\nSince Fae is not sunny, by Premise 1, Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThus, we have proven that Taylor is a visionary."}]
