You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

From premise (15), we know that Fae is a vumpus, not a rompus, and a wumpus.\n\nSince Fae is a jompus (from premise 14) and every jompus is a rompus (from premise 11), it follows that Fae should be a rompus. However, premise (15) states that Fae is not a rompus. This creates a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the assumption that Fae is a jompus must be incorrect if we are to resolve the contradiction. Since Fae is stated to be a jompus in premise (14), and this leads to a contradiction, we must conclude that the initial conditions or classifications provided in the premises may contain inconsistencies or errors.\n\nGiven the contradiction, we cannot definitively prove that Taylor is a visionary based on the provided premises alone. The conclusion that Fae is not a zumpus (and thus Taylor is a visionary) cannot be derived without resolving the inconsistency in the premises.\n\nHence, with the current set of premises, we cannot prove that Taylor is a visionary."}]
