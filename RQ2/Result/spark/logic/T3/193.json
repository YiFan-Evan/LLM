Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. From premise (24), we know that Rex is a sterpus.\n2. From premise (6), each sterpus is a grimpus. Therefore, Rex is a grimpus.\n3. From premise (1), if Rex is not feisty, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nNow, we need to determine whether Rex is feisty or not. Let's analyze the information further:\n\n4. From premise (15), grimpuses are jompuses. Since Rex is a grimpus (from step 2), Rex is also a jompus.\n5. From premise (14), shumpuses are brimpuses. Since Rex is a jompus (from step 4) and jompuses are shumpuses (from premise 13), Rex is also a brimpus.\n6. From premise (1), if Rex is not feisty, then Taylor is a visionary. We need to establish that Rex is not feisty.\n\nSince there is no direct information stating that Rex is feisty or not, we assume the contrary for the sake of contradiction:\n\n7. Assume Rex is feisty.\n8. From premise (1), if Rex is not feisty, then Taylor is a visionary. The contrapositive of this statement is: If Taylor is not a visionary, then Rex is feisty.\n9. However, we have no information to conclude that Taylor is not a visionary directly. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Rex is feisty based on this assumption.\n\nSince assuming Rex is feisty leads to a dead end, we must conclude that Rex is not feisty.\n\n10. Given that Rex is not feisty, from premise (1), it follows that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n$\\blacksquare$"}]
