(Premise 3)\n4. Every sterpus is a gorpus. (Premise 4)\n5. Every impus is a shumpus. (Premise 5)\n6. Brimpuses are numpuses. (Premise 6)\n7. Wumpuses are rompuses. (Premise 7)\n8.

Max is a yumpus and a lempus and a shumpus. (Premise 12)\n13. Max is an impus and a dumpus and a jompus. (Premise 13)\n\nFrom Premise 9, we know that Max is a brimpus. According to Premise 6, brimpuses are numpuses. Therefore, Max is a numpus.\n\nFrom Premise 13, we know that Max is a dumpus. However, according to Premise 3, dumpuses are not numpuses. This creates a contradiction because Max cannot be both a numpus and a dumpus at the same time.\n\nSince there is a contradiction, it means that our initial assumption that Max is a tumpus must be false. Therefore, Max is not a tumpus.\n\nAccording to Premise 1, if Max is not a tumpus, then Taylor is a visionary. Since we have proven that Max is not a tumpus, we can conclude that Taylor is indeed a visionary.\n\nHence, we have proven that Taylor is a visionary."}]
