Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Here's the step-by-step proof:\n\n1. From premise (25), we know that Polly is a rompus.\n2. According to premise (19), every zumpus is a rompus. Since Polly is a rompus, by Modus Ponens, Polly is also a zumpus.\n3. Premise (18) states that each gorpus is shy. Since Polly is a zumpus (from step 2) and every zumpus is a rompus (premise 20), Polly is also a gorpus. Therefore, Polly is shy.\n4. Premise (1) states that if Polly is shy, then Taylor is a visionary. Since we have established that Polly is shy (from step 3), it follows that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThus, we have proven that Taylor is a visionary."}]
