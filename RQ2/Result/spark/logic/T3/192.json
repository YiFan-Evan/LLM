Rex is a jompus. (Premise 24)\n2. Each jompus is a tumpus. (Premise 23)\n   - Therefore, Rex is a tumpus. (From 1 and 2 by modus ponens)\n3. Tumpuses are brimpuses. (Premise 17)\n   - Therefore, Rex is a brimpus. (From 2 and 3 by modus ponens)\n4. Every brimpus is not melodic. (Premise 6)\n   - Therefore, Rex is not melodic. (From 3 and 4 by modus ponens)\n5. Each impus is a dumpus. (Premise 3)\n6. Impuses are sweet. (Premise 12)\n   - Therefore, each dumpus is sweet. (From 5 and 6 by syllogism)\n7. Dumpuses are fruity. (Premise 7)\n8. Rex is a numpus. (Premise 25)\n9. Numpuses are rompuses. (Premise 2)\n   - Therefore, Rex is a rompus. (From 8 and 9 by modus ponens)\n10. Each rompus is an impus. (Assumed for this proof)\n    - Therefore, Rex is an impus. (From 9 and 10 by modus ponens)\n11. From (5), each impus is a dumpus.\n    - Therefore, Rex is a dumpus.
