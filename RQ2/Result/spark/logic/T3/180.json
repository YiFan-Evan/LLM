Since Sally is a brimpus, by premise (5), she is also a lorpus. From premise (7), since Sally is a lorpus, she is also a vumpus. Additionally, from premise (12), Sally is explicitly stated to be a vumpus. Therefore, Sally is definitely a vumpus.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of Sally being a rompus. According to premise (8), every rompus is a numpus. However, premise (13) states that Sally is not a numpus, which creates a contradiction if Sally were an impus because then she would have to be a rompus (from premise (4)) and thus a numpus (from premise (8)).\n\nSince we have established that Sally is a vumpus and cannot be both a rompus and not a numpus at the same time, it follows that Sally cannot be an impus. Given this, we can use premise (1) to conclude that Taylor is a visionary, as it states that if Sally is not an impus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that Taylor is a visionary."}]
