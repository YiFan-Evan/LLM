However, there is no direct link between being a jompus and being a yumpus in the given premises.\n- From (18), each impus is not sunny. If we can establish that Fae is an impus, then we can conclude that Fae is not sunny.\n- From (23), yumpuses are impuses, but we do not have any direct information linking Fae to being a yumpus.\n- From (24), every impus is a wumpus, but again, we do not have any direct information linking Fae to being an impus.\n\nGiven the premises, we cannot directly conclude that Fae is an impus or a yumpus based on the provided information. Therefore, we cannot definitively prove that Fae is not sunny with the given premises alone.\n\nHowever, if we assume that there is a missing link or additional premise connecting Fae to being an impus or a yumpus, then we could use premise (18) to conclude that Fae is not sunny. Without such a connection, the conclusion cannot be definitively proven with the given premises.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided premises, we cannot prove that Fae is not sunny."}]
