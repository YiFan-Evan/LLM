You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Since Rex is a dumpus (from step 1) and all dumpuses are impuses (premise 15), Rex is an impus.\n5. From premise (12), shumpuses are brimpuses.\n6. From premise (1), Rex is a dumpus, and from premise (2), Rex is a sterpus.\n7. From premise (20), each sterpus is a grimpus, so Rex is a grimpus.\n8. From premise (19), every grimpus is a zumpus, so Rex is a zumpus.\n9. From premise (24), each shumpus is not feisty, and since Rex is a dumpus (step 1) and all dumpuses are impuses (premise 15), Rex is an impus.\n10. From premise (13), jompuses are shumpuses, and from premise (21), every jompus is a gorpus, so Rex is a gorpus.\n11. From premise (22), every jompus is red, so Rex is red.\n12.

From premise (9), lorpuses are cold, and from premise (10), shumpuses are lorpuses, so Rex is a lorpus.\n17.
