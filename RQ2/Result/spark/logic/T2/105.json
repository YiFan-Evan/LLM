Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Sally is an impus.\n2. Sally is a vumpus.\n3. Sally is not a rompus, Sally is a brimpus, and Sally is a tumpus.\n4. Sally is a shumpus and a jompus and a lempus.\n5. Brimpuses are jompuses.\n6. Everything that is a vumpus, a wumpus, and an impus is a lempus.\n7. Each dumpus is a rompus.\n8. Everything that is a vumpus, a yumpus, and a shumpus is a lempus.\n9. Sally is a vumpus.\n10. Sally is a shumpus.\n11. Every tumpus is a shumpus.\n12. Sally is a dumpus.\n13. Everything that is a vumpus, a wumpus, and an impus is a rompus.\n14. Sally is a yumpus.\n\nWe need to prove:\n15. Sally is not a wumpus.\n\nLet's go through the premises step by step:\n\n- From (1) and (2), we know Sally is both an impus and a vumpus.\n- From (3), we know Sally is not a rompus, but she is a brimpus and a tumpus.\n- From (4), we know Sally is a shumpus, a jompus, and a lempus.\n- From (5), since Sally is a brimpus (from (3)), she is also a jompus.\n- From (6), if Sally were a wumpus, combined with (1) and (2), she would be a lempus. However, this does not provide direct information about her being or not being a wumpus yet.\n- From (7), since Sally is a dumpus (from (12)), she is also a rompus. This contradicts (3), where it is stated that Sally is not a rompus. Therefore, there must be an inconsistency if Sally were a wumpus because of the implications in (6) and (13).\n- From (8), combining Sally being a vumpus (from (9)), a yumpus (from (14)), and a shumpus (from (10)), she is a lempus.\n- From (11), since Sally is a tumpus (from (3)), she is also a shumpus.\n- From (13), if Sally were a wumpus, combined with (1) and (2), she would be a rompus. This again contradicts (3), where it is stated that Sally is not a rompus.\n\nSince assuming Sally is a wumpus leads to contradictions with the given premises (specifically (3) and (7)), we can conclude that Sally cannot be a wumpus.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that:\nSally is not a wumpus."}]
