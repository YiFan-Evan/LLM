From premise (24), we know that every zumpus is a dumpus. Since Sam is a zumpus (premise 1), he must also be a dumpus.\n2. From premise (15), we know that numpuses are not bitter. Since Sam is a dumpus (from step 1) and dumpuses are jompuses (premise 23), Sam must also be a jompus.\n3. From premise (9), we know that every jompus is a numpus.
