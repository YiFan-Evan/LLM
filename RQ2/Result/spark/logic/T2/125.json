Rex is not a grimpus.\n\n### Analysis:\n\nFrom Premise 4, we know:\n- Rex is a tumpus.\n- Rex is not a brimpus.\n- Rex is an impus.\n\nFrom Premise 9:\n- Since Rex is an impus (from Premise 4), and all impuses are wumpuses (Premise 9), Rex is also a wumpus. This confirms Premise 10.\n\nFrom Premise 1:\n- Rex is a yumpus.\n\nFrom Premise 3 and Premise 11:\n- Rex is a shumpus.\n\nFrom Premise 8:\n- Rex is a lorpus.\n\nUsing Premise 5:\n- Since Rex is a lorpus, a shumpus, and a wumpus, Rex must be a dumpus.\n\nUsing Premise 6:\n- Since Rex is a lorpus (Premise 8) and all lorpuses are brimpuses (Premise 6), Rex must be a brimpus. However, this contradicts the information from Premise 4 that Rex is not a brimpus.\n\nThis contradiction implies that our assumption that Rex is a grimpus must be incorrect because if Rex were a grimpus, then according to Premise 13, Rex would be a brimpus (since Rex is a shumpus, a yumpus, and a grimpus). But we know from Premise 4 that Rex is not a brimpus.\n\nTherefore, Rex cannot be a grimpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nRex is not a grimpus."}]
