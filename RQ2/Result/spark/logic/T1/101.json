[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

From premise (9), we know that Wren is a lempus.\n2. From premise (4), we know that all lempuses are brimpuses.\n3. Therefore, by modus ponens, we can conclude that Wren is a brimpus.\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation of the proof:\n\n* Premise (9) states that Wren is a lempus.\n* Premise (4) states that all lempuses are brimpuses.\n* Modus ponens is a rule of inference that allows us to infer a conclusion from two premises, one of which is a conditional statement and the other of which is the antecedent of the conditional statement.\n* In this case, the conditional statement is \"All lempuses are brimpuses\" (premise 4), and the antecedent of the conditional statement is \"Wren is a lempus\" (premise 9).\n* Therefore, by modus ponens, we can infer the consequent of the conditional statement, which is \"Wren is a brimpus.\"\n\nThis completes the proof."}]
