You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. From (14), Wren is a tumpus, a yumpus, a zumpus, or a sterpus.\n2. From (15), Wren is a yumpus or a zumpus or a sterpus or a lempus.\n3. Since Wren is either a yumpus, a zumpus, or a sterpus from (15), and all of these categories are covered in (14), we can focus on the specific cases:\n   - If Wren is a yumpus, then by (7), Wren is a gorpus.\n   - If Wren is a zumpus, then by (8), Wren is a gorpus.\n   - If Wren is a sterpus, then by (4), Wren is a gorpus.\n4. Alternatively, if Wren is a lempus (from (15)), then by (3), Wren is a gorpus.\n\nSince Wren falls into one of the categories that lead to being a gorpus in each case, we can conclude that Wren is indeed a gorpus.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion (16) Wren is a gorpus is proven based on the given premises."}]
