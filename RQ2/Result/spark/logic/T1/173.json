Therefore, if Fae were a zumpus, it would have to be at least one of these three categories.\n\nLet's examine each category:\n1. **Sterpus**: From (1), each sterpus is a jompus. Since Fae is a jompus (from (13)), this condition is satisfied. However, being a jompus alone does not make Fae a sterpus.\n2. **Grimpus**: From (6), grimpuses are tumpuses, yumpuses, and rompuses. We know from (14) that Fae is not a rompus, so Fae cannot be a grimpus.\n3. **Impus**: From (12), every impus is a lempus. From (11), wumpuses are lempuses. Since Fae is a wumpus (from (14)), Fae is also a lempus and thus could potentially be an impus. However, being an impus alone does not make Fae a zumpus without also being a sterpus or a grimpus.\n\nSince Fae cannot be a grimpus (due to not being a rompus), and being an impus or a sterpus alone is insufficient for being a zumpus, we conclude that Fae does not meet all the criteria to be classified as a zumpus.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that:\n\nFae is not a zumpus."}]
