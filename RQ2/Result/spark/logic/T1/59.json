You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

From premise (1), we know that if something is angry, aggressive, and a shumpus, then it is a grimpus.\n2. From premise (14), we know that Alex is angry.\n3. From premise (13), we know that Alex is aggressive.\n4. From premise (15), we know that Alex is a shumpus.\n\nCombining these facts:\n- Since Alex is angry [(14)], aggressive [(13)], and a shumpus [(15)], we can apply premise (1) to conclude that Alex is a grimpus.\n\nAdditionally, we have:\n- From premise (8), Alex is orange.\n- From premise (9), Alex is red.\n\nTherefore, combining all these facts together:\n- Alex is orange [(8)] and red [(9)] and a grimpus (as proven above).\n\nHence, we have proven that:\n- Alex is orange and red and a grimpus.\n\nSo, the statement \"Alex is orange and red and a grimpus\" is true based on the given premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
