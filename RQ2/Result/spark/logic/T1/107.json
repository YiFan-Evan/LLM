According to premise (7), everything that is snowy and a tumpus is a shumpus. Therefore, since Sam is both snowy and a tumpus, we can conclude that Sam is a shumpus.\n4. From premise (16), we know that Sam is dull.\n\nCombining these points, we have:\n- Sam is dull (from premise 16).\n- Sam is a shumpus (deduced from premises 13, 15, and 7).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Sam is dull and a shumpus.
