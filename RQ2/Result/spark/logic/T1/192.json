You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Let's go through the steps methodically:\n\n1. **Rex is a jompus** (Premise 23).\n2. **Every jompus is a tumpus** (Premise 22). Therefore, Rex is a tumpus.\n3. **Tumpuses are brimpuses** (Premise 16). Therefore, Rex is a brimpus.\n4. **Every brimpus is not melodic** (Premise 5). Therefore, Rex is not melodic.\n5. **Tumpuses are lorpuses** (Premise 4). Therefore, Rex is a lorpus.\n6. **Every lorpus is an impus** (Premise 8). Therefore, Rex is an impus.\n7. **Imposes are sweet** (Premise 11). Therefore, Rex is sweet.\n\nThus, we have proven that Rex is sweet using the given premises."}]
