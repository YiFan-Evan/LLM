You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

From premise (10), we know that Rex is a numpus.\n2. From premise (5), we know that everything that is brown or a numpus is a tumpus.\n3. Since Rex is a numpus (from step 1), we can conclude that Rex is a tumpus (from step 2).\n4. Therefore, Rex is temperate or a tumpus.\n\nHere is a more detailed explanation of each step:\n\n* Step 1: We start with the fact that Rex is a numpus, which is given in premise (10).\n* Step 2: We then use premise (5) to conclude that Rex is a tumpus. This is because premise (5) states that everything that is brown or a numpus is a tumpus, and Rex is a numpus (from step 1).\n* Step 3: Finally, we use the fact that Rex is a tumpus (from step 2) to conclude that Rex is temperate or a tumpus. This is because anything that is a tumpus is also temperate or a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that Rex is temperate or a tumpus."}]
