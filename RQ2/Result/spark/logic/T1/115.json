Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Premise (2)** states that \"Nummpuses are metallic, liquid, rompuses, and lorpuses.\"\n   - This means if something is a nummpus, it must also be a rompus and a lorpus.\n\n2. **Premise (6)** states that \"Every zumpus is discordant and melodic and a jompus and a nummpus.\"\n   - This means if something is a zumpus, it must also be discordant, melodic, a jompus, and a nummpus.\n\n3. **Premise (8)** states that \"Sally is discordant, melodic, a nummpus, and a rompus.\"\n   - From this, we know Sally is a nummpus.\n\n4. Since Sally is a nummpus (from Premise 8), and according to Premise 2, all nummpuses are also lorpuses, we can conclude that Sally is a lorpus.\n\nTherefore, using the given premises and logical deduction, we have proven that:\n\n**(10) Sally is a lorpus.**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

From premise (8), we know that Sally is a numpus.\n2. From premise (6), we know that every zumpus is a numpus.\n3. Therefore, by the principle of transitivity, Sally is a zumpus.\n4.
