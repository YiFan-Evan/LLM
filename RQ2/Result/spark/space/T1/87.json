Start at the carousel (position 7).\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise: You will land on the eggnog (position 8).\n3. Move 4 steps clockwise: You will land on the stupa (position 9).\n4. Move 2 steps clockwise: You will land back on the carousel (position 7).\n\nSince you end up back at the carousel, you have completed one full cycle of the circular path and returned to your starting point.
