Starting from the Maltese, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 19 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 13 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction.

The only thing that matters is the net direction in which you are moving (clockwise or counter-clockwise) and how many steps you take in that direction.\n\nStarting from the Maltese, you move:\n\n- 3 steps counter-clockwise\n- 19 steps clockwise\n- 13 steps counter-clockwise\n- 9 steps clockwise\n\nTo find out where you end up, we need to add these movements together. Since each step moves you one dot around the circle, you can think of this as adding or subtracting from your starting position.\n\nStarting at Maltese (position 5), you move:\n\n- 3 steps counter-clockwise = -3 positions\n- 19 steps clockwise = +19 positions\n- 13 steps counter-clockwise = -13 positions\n- 9 steps clockwise = +9 positions\n\nAdding these together:\n\n(-3) + 19 + (-13) + 9 = 9\n\nSo, you end up at the 9th position from the start.
