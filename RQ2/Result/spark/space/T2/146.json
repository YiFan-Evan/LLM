The starting item is the Appenzeller Sennenhund, and we will calculate the new position after each set of movements in a circular manner.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Position:**\n   - The items on the path are listed in a clockwise order starting from the strainer at position 1.\n   - We need to find the position of the Appenzeller Sennenhund. From the list, the Appenzeller Sennenhund is at position 14 (counting from the strainer).\n\n2. **Calculate New Positions:**\n   - Each movement is calculated by adding the number of steps to the current position and then taking the modulo 20 to ensure the position stays within the bounds of the 20 dots.\n\n3. **First Movement: 8 Steps Counter-Clockwise:**\n   - New position = (14 - 8) % 20 = 6 % 20 = 6\n\n4. **Second Movement: 6 Steps Clockwise:**\n   - New position = (6 + 6) % 20 = 12 % 20 = 12\n\n5. **Third Movement: 17 Steps Counter-Clockwise:**\n   - New position = (12 - 17) % 20 = -5 % 20 = 15\n\n6. **Fourth Movement: 7 Steps Clockwise:**\n   - New position = (15 + 7) % 20 = 22 % 20 = 2\n\n### Final Position:\nAfter all movements, you end up at position 2. According to the list provided:\n\n- Strainer (1)\n- Yawl (2)\n- Oxygen Mask (3)\n- Small White (4)\n- Monarch Butterfly (5)\n- Ladle (6)\n- Microwave Oven (7)\n- Wall Clock (8)\n- Pillow (9)\n- Green Mamba (10)\n- China Cabinet (11)\n- Snorkel (12)\n- Limousine (13)\n- Orange (14)\n- Appenzeller Sennenhund (15)\n- Beer Bottle (16)\n- Bassinet (17)\n- Alp (18)\n- Kimono (19)\n- Military Uniform (20)\n\nThe item at position 2 is a **Yawl**.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n```markdown\n**Yawl**\n```"}]
