Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express the integral of a product of two functions as the difference of integrals of the individual functions.\n\nLet's apply integration by parts to our function:\n\nLet u = cos(x), and dv = dx. Then du/dx = -sin(x) and v = x.\n\nApplying integration by parts, we get:\n\nI(x) = [u * v] - [integral of u * dv]\n      = [cos(x) * x] - [integral of cos(x) * dx]\n      = x * cos(x) - sin(x) + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, if we want to evaluate the integral at x=4, we substitute x=4 into the expression for I(x):\n\nI(4) = 4 * cos(4) - sin(4) + C\n\nTo find the integer result by rounding down, we would need to calculate the exact value of this expression. However, since I cannot perform calculations here, you would need to do that on your own or with a calculator.
