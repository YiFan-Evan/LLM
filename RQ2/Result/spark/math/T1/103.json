Let's denote the function as f(x) = e^(1/x).\n\nThe first step is to find a suitable function u(x) and v'(x) such that u'(x) = v(x) and v'(x) = f(x). \n\nLet's choose u(x) = e^(1/x) and v(x) = x. Then, u'(x) = -1/x^2 * e^(1/x) and v'(x) = 1.\n\nNow, we can apply integration by parts:\n\n\u222be^(1/x) dx = [e^(1/x)] - [x * e^(1/x)] + C\n\nIntegrating each term separately:\n\n\u222be^(1/x) dx = e^(1/x) - x * e^(1/x) + C\n\nSince we want to find the constant of integration C, we can set the limits of integration from -\u221e to \u221e (since the original function is defined for all real numbers except zero). However, since we are interested in the value at x=4, we will evaluate the integral at this point.\n\nSubstituting x=4 into the expression:\n\nC = e^(1/4) - 4 * e^(1/4)\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of the integral at x=4:\n\n\u222be^(1/x) dx | x=4 = e^(1/4) - 4 * e^(1/4)\n\nFinally, we need to round down the result to the nearest integer. Since the result is a fraction, we can simplify it before rounding down:\n\ne^(1/4) - 4 * e^(1/4) = e^(1/4) * (1 - 4)\n\nNow, let's compute the actual values:\n\ne^(1/4) = (e^0)^(1/4) = 1^(1/4) = 1\n\nSo, the expression becomes:\n\n1 - 4 * 1 = -3\n\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\n\n-3"}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f $e^{\\frac{1}{x}}$ \u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c$e^{\\frac{1}{x}}$ \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u6570\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5e95\u6570\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u6570\u7684\u5e95 $e$\uff0c\u800c\u6307\u6570\u662f $\\frac{1}{x}$\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u6ca1\u6709\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u5c31\u662f\uff1a\n\n$$ e^{\\frac{1}{x}} $$\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c$e^{\\frac{1}{x}}$ \u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f $e^{\\frac{1}{x}}$\u3002"}]
