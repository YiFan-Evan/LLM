[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

However, for all other values of x where x \u2260 0, the function can be evaluated as follows:\n\nf(x) = x^2 / x\n\nTo find the indefinite integral of this function with respect to x, we use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv/dx = x^2 / x. Then du/dx = 1 and v = \u222b x^2 dx = x^3 / 3 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstituting these into the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = uv - \u222b v du\n            = x * (x^3 / 3 + C) - \u222b (x^3 / 3 + C) * dx\n            = x^4 / 4 + Cx - \u222b (x^3 / 3 + C) dx\n\nSince the derivative of (x^3 / 3 + C) is x^2, we can integrate it directly:\n\n\u222b (x^3 / 3 + C) dx = (x^4 / 4) + Cx^2 + D\n\nNow, we have two unknowns: C and D. Since we are looking for an antiderivative (the indefinite integral), we can choose any constant for D that makes the expression complete. For simplicity, let's choose D = 0.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of f(x) = x^2 / x with respect to x is:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = (x^4 / 4) + Cx^2\n\nFor x = 4, we substitute into the expression:\n\n\u222b f(4) dx = (4^4 / 4) + C(4^2)\n          = 256/4 + C*16\n          = 64 + C*16\n\nSince we don't know the value of C, we cannot provide a specific integer result for the expression when x = 4. However, if you want to round down the result to the nearest integer, you would do so by ignoring the fractional part of the result. In this case, the result would be:\n\n64 (rounded down from 64.0 + C*16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "x^2/x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6765\u770b\u4e00\u4e0b\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1a\n\n$$\\frac{x^2}{x}$$\n\n\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u5206\u6bcd\u4e2d\u7684 $x$ \u8fdb\u884c\u7ea6\u7b80\uff1a\n\n$$\\frac{x^2}{x} = x^{2-1} = x$$\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c$\\frac{x^2}{x}$ \u7b80\u5316\u540e\u7b49\u4e8e $x$\u3002\n\n\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f $x$\u3002"}]
