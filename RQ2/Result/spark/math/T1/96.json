Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nThe integral of cos(x^2) dx is not a standard elementary function and cannot be expressed in terms of basic functions like polynomials, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc. However, it can be expressed using special functions or numerical methods.\n\nIf you want to evaluate the integral at a specific point, say x = 4, you would need to use numerical methods or software that can handle this type of integral. Here's an example using Python's `scipy` library:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy import integrate\nimport numpy as np\n\ndef f(x):\n    return np.cos(x**2)\n\n# Evaluate the definite integral from 0 to 4\nresult, error = integrate.quad(f, 0, 4)\nprint(\"The value of the integral from 0 to 4 is approximately:\", result)\n```\n\nThis code will give you the numerical value of the integral from 0 to 4 of the function cos(x^2).
