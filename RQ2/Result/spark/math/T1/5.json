The cosine function has a period of 2\u03c0 (or 360 degrees) and its values range from -1 to 1.\n\nTo calculate the cosine of an angle x in Python, you can use the `math` module which provides the `cos()` function. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the angle in radians\nangle_in_radians = math.pi / 4  # For example, 45 degrees converted to radians\n\n# Calculate the cosine of the angle\ncosine_value = math.cos(angle_in_radians)\n\nprint(\"Cosine of\", angle_in_radians, \"is\", cosine_value)\n```\n\nIf you want to convert degrees to radians before calculating the cosine, you can use the following conversion factor:\n\n```python\ndegrees = 45\nradians = math.radians(degrees)\ncosine_value = math.cos(radians)\n\nprint(\"Cosine of\", degrees, \"degrees is\", cosine_value)\n```\n\nRemember that the `math.cos()` function expects the input in radians, not degrees. If you have an angle in degrees, you need to convert it to radians first using `math.radians()`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8981\u6c42\u89e3 $\\cos(x)$ \u7684\u503c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u9053 $x$ \u7684\u5177\u4f53\u503c\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c $x$ \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 $x = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$\uff0c\u5219\uff1a\n$$\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right) = \\frac{1}{2}$$\n\n\u5982\u679c $x$ \u662f\u4e00\u822c\u89d2\u5ea6\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48 $\\cos(x)$ \u7684\u503c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e $x$ \u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6570\u503c\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c$\\cos(x)$ \u7684\u503c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e $x$ \u7684\u5177\u4f53\u503c\u3002"}]
