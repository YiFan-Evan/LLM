[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

To find the indefinite integral of this function, we can use integration by parts or simplify it first.\n\nLet's start by simplifying the expression:\n\n```\n(1+(1+x)) = 2 + x\n```\n\nNow, let's integrate both sides with respect to `x`:\n\n```\n\u222b (2 + x) dx\n```\n\nThe integral of a constant times `x` is `0.5 * x^2 + C`, where `C` is the constant of integration. So, the indefinite integral of `(1+(1+x))` is:\n\n```\n0.5 * x^2 + C\n```\n\nIf you want to substitute `x=4` into this result, you would do so as follows:\n\n```\n0.5 * (4)^2 + C = 8 + C\n```\n\nSince there is no specific value for `C` given, we cannot determine its exact value. However, if you need an integer result by rounding down, you could choose any real number for `C` that makes the result an integer when rounded down. For example, if you choose `C = 0`, then the result would be `8`. If you choose `C = -1`, the result would be `7`.
