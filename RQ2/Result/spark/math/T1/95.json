Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions. The basic idea is to express the integral as the difference of two simpler integrals, and then solve for one of them using the original function.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = sin(x) dx. Then:\n\ndu/dx = e^x dx\ndv/dx = cos(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integrals of these derivatives:\n\nI(x) = \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx\n     = [e^x * cos(x)] - \u222b e^x * (-sin(x)) dx\n     = [e^x * cos(x)] + \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx\n\nThe second term on the right side is exactly the same as the original function, so we have a recursion. To break this recursion, we can introduce a new variable w such that w = x - C, where C is some constant. This will allow us to write the integral as:\n\nI(x) = \u222b e^w * sin(w + C) dw\n\nNow, let's try to solve this integral. We can use the substitution u = sin(w + C) and dv = e^w du:\n\ndu/dw = e^w dw\ndv/dw = cos(w + C) dw\n\nSo, our integral becomes:\n\nI(x) = \u222b e^w * sin(w + C) dw\n     = [e^w * cos(w + C)] - \u222b e^w * (-cos(w + C)) dw\n     = [e^w * cos(w + C)] + \u222b e^w * cos(w + C) dw\n\nThis is still the same as the original function, which means we have an infinite recursion. However, we can see that the integral cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions without using special functions or techniques like partial fraction decomposition.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of e^x/sin(x) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x/sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u51fd\u6570 $e^x / \\sin(x)$ \u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8003\u8651\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u5206\u6bcd $\\sin(x)$ \u4e0d\u80fd\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64 $x$ \u4e0d\u80fd\u662f $\\pi$ \u7684\u6574\u6570\u500d\uff0c\u5373\uff1a\n$$ x \\neq n\\pi, \\quad n \\in \\mathbb{Z} $$\n\n\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5206\u6790\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u4ee5\u4e86\u89e3\u5176\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u548c\u6781\u503c\u70b9\u3002\n\n\u8bbe $f(x) = \\frac{e^x}{\\sin(x)}$\uff0c\u5219\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u4e3a\uff1a\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{e^x}{\\sin(x)}\\right) $$\n\n\u4f7f\u7528\u5546\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u6cd5\u5219\uff1a\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x) \\cdot e^x - e^x \\cdot \\cos(x)}{\\sin^2(x)} $$\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{e^x (\\sin(x) - \\cos(x))}{\\sin^2(x)} $$\n\n\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790 $f'(x)$ \u7684\u7b26\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u5b9a $f(x)$ \u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u3002\u5f53 $\\sin(x) > \\cos(x)$ \u65f6\uff0c$f'(x) > 0$\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u9012\u589e\uff1b\u5f53 $\\sin(x) < \\cos(x)$ \u65f6\uff0c$f'(x) < 0$\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u9012\u51cf\u3002\n\n\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u51fd\u6570 $e^x / \\sin(x)$ \u5728 $x \\neq n\\pi$ \u5904\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u4e3a\uff1a\n$$ f'(x) = \\frac{e^x (\\sin(x) - \\cos(x))}{\\sin^2(x)} $$"}]
