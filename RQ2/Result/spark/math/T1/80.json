Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts involves choosing a function u(x) and its derivative v(x) such that the integral of u(x) * dv(x) is equal to the original function. In this case, we can choose u(x) = 1 and v(x) = x^(-2).\n\nThe integral of u(x) * dv(x) is:\nI(x) = u(x) * v(x) - \\int v(x) * du(x)\n\nSubstituting u(x) = 1 and v(x) = x^(-2):\nI(x) = x^(-2) - \\int x^(-3) dx\n\nNow, let's integrate the second part:\n\\int x^(-3) dx = -x^(-1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstituting back into the first equation:\nI(x) = x^(-2) - (-x^(-1)) + C\nI(x) = x^(-2) + x^(-1) + C\n\nSince we want to find the value of the integral at x = 4, we can substitute x = 4 into the expression:\nI(4) = (4^(-2)) + (4^(-1)) + C\nI(4) = 0.0625 + 0.25 + C\n\nHowever, since we are asked for an integer result by rounding down, we need to round down the result to the nearest integer. The exact value of C is not specified, so we cannot determine it without additional information.
