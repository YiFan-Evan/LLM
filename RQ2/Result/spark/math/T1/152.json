Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product equals the original function. Then, you integrate one part and differentiate the other.\n\nFor our function ln(x)/(1/x), let's choose:\nf(x) = ln(x)\ng(x) = x\n\nThe derivative of f(x) * g(x) is:\ndf/dx * g(x) + f(x) * dg/dx = 1/x * ln(x) + ln(x) * 1 = ln(x) + ln(x) = 2ln(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the integrals of f(x) and g(x):\nI_f(x) = \u222b ln(x) dx = x*ln(x) - x\nI_g(x) = \u222b x dx = 1/2 x^2\n\nSubstituting these back into the derivative expression, we get:\n2ln(x) = x*ln(x) - x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSolving for C, we get:\nC = x*ln(x) - x\n\nNow, we can write the indefinite integral as:\nI(x) = x*ln(x) - x + C\n\nSince we want to find the value of the integral at x=4, we substitute x=4 into the expression:\nI(4) = 4*ln(4) - 4 + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate this expression. However, since the question asks for the integer result rounded down, we will not include the constant of integration C in our final answer.\n\nI(4) = 4*ln(4) - 4\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this expression:\nI(4) = 4*ln(4) - 4\n      \u2248 4*1.3863 - 4\n      \u2248 5.5452 - 4\n      \u2248 1.5452\n\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\nI(4) \u2248 1\n\nTherefore, the integer result of the expression when x=4 is 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(x)/(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f $\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\frac{1}{x}}$ \u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u7b80\u5316\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5206\u6bcd\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u5012\u6570\u8fd0\u7b97\uff1a\n\n$$\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\frac{1}{x}} = \\ln(x) \\cdot x$$\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f $\\frac{\\ln(x)}{\\frac{1}{x}}$ \u53ef\u4ee5\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n$$\\ln(x) \\cdot x$$\n\n\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n$$\\boxed{\\ln(x) \\cdot x}$$"}]
