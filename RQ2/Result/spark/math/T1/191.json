So, the integral becomes:\n\u222b e^(ln(sin(x))) dx = \u222b e^(ln(u)) (du/dx) dx\n\nNow, let's solve for the integral of e^(ln(u)) with respect to x:\n\u222b e^(ln(u)) (du/dx) dx = \u222b e^(ln(u)) cos(x) dx\n\nNow, let's use the fact that e^ln(u) = u when u > 0, which is true since sin(x) is always between -1 and 1. Therefore, we have:\n\u222b e^(ln(sin(x))) dx = \u222b sin(x) cos(x) dx\n\nNow, we can integrate this term by term:\n\u222b sin(x) cos(x) dx = -cos(x) sin(x) + C\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of e^ln(sin(x)) is:\n-cos(x) sin(x) + C\n\nNow, if you want to substitute x=4 into this result, we need to know the value of C. However, without knowing the constant of integration, we cannot evaluate the integral at a specific point.
