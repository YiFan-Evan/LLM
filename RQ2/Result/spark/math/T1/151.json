To find the indefinite integral of this function, we can use integration by parts.\n\nLet's denote the indefinite integral as `F(x)`. We have:\n\n```\nF(x) = (1+(1+x)) + C\n```\n\nWhere `C` is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, let's differentiate both sides of the equation to get the derivative of `F(x)`:\n\n```\ndF/dx = d/dx [(1+(1+x)) + C]\n```\n\nDifferentiating each term separately:\n\n```\ndF/dx = 1 + d/dx (1+x) + d/dx C\n```\n\nSince `d/dx (1+x) = 1`, and `d/dx C = 0` (since `C` is a constant), we get:\n\n```\ndF/dx = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2\n```\n\nSo, the derivative of `F(x)` is `2`.\n\nTo find the indefinite integral, we need to solve for `F(x)` when `x = 0`. Since `F(x) = (1+(1+x)) + C`, and `x = 0`, we have:\n\n```\nF(0) = (1+(1+0)) + C\nF(0) = 2 + C\n```\n\nSince `C` is an arbitrary constant, we can choose it to be `0` without loss of generality. Therefore, the indefinite integral of the function `(1+(1+x))` with respect to `x` is:\n\n```\nF(x) = x + x + 1 + C\nF(x) = 2x + 1\n```\n\nSubstituting `x=4` into the indefinite integral gives us:\n\n```\nF(4) = 2*4 + 1 = 8 + 1 = 9\n```\n\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get the final result as `9`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+(1+x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u5316\u3002\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u662f\uff1a\n\\[ (1 + (1 + x)) \\]\n\n\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5148\u8ba1\u7b97\u62ec\u53f7\u5185\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\n\\[ 1 + x \\]\n\n\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee3\u5165\u5230\u5916\u5c42\u7684\u62ec\u53f7\u4e2d\uff1a\n\\[ 1 + (1 + x) = 1 + 1 + x = 2 + x \\]\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff1a\n\\[ 2 + x \\]\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f \\( (1 + (1 + x)) \\) \u7b80\u5316\u540e\u4e3a \\( 2 + x \\)\u3002"}]
