Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product is equal to the original function. Then, we express the integral as the sum of the integral of one part and the integral of the other part, each multiplied by a constant of integration.\n\nFor our function x*sinh(x), we can choose f(x) = x and g(x) = sinh(x). The derivative of f(x)*g(x) is f'(x)*g(x) + f(x)*g'(x), which simplifies to x*sinh(x) + x*cosh(x). Since this matches the original function, we can proceed with integration by parts.\n\nThe integral of x is 1/2 * x^2 + C, where C is the constant of integration. The integral of sinh(x) is (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / 2 + C.\n\nNow, let's substitute these results back into the equation:\n\nI(x) = [1/2 * x^2 + C] - [(exp(x) - exp(-x)) / 2 + C] + C\n     = 1/2 * x^2 - (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / 2 + C\n\nSince we want to find the value of the integral at x=4, we can substitute x=4 into the expression:\n\nI(4) = 1/2 * 4^2 - (exp(4) - exp(-4)) / 2 + C\n      = 8 - (exp(4) - exp(-4)) / 2 + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the expression for exp(4) and exp(-4) using a calculator or software. After doing so, we can plug in the values and solve for C if needed. However, since you asked for an integer result rounded down, we will ignore the constant of integration C and focus on the non-constant terms.\n\nLet's calculate the non-constant terms:\n\nexp(4) = e^4 \u2248 2.5063\nexp(-4) = e^-4 \u2248 0.0183\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for I(4):\n\nI(4) \u2248 8 - (2.5063 - 0.0183) / 2\n    \u2248 8 - (2.4880) / 2\n    \u2248 8 - 1.2440\n    \u2248 6.7560\n\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\n\nI(4) \u2248 6\n\nSo, the integer result of the expression after rounding down is 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "x*sinh(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u51fd\u6570 $x \\cdot \\sinh(x)$ \u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5f26\u51fd\u6570 $\\sinh(x)$ \u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1a\n$$\\sinh(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$$\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06 $x \\cdot \\sinh(x)$ \u8868\u793a\u4e3a\uff1a\n$$x \\cdot \\sinh(x) = x \\cdot \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} = \\frac{x (e^x - e^{-x})}{2}$$\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5df2\u7ecf\u662f\u6700\u7b80\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a\n$$x \\cdot \\sinh(x) = \\frac{x (e^x - e^{-x})}{2}$$"}]
