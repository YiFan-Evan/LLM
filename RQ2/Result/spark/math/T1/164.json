Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product is equal to the original function. Then, you integrate one part and differentiate the other.\n\nFor our case, let's choose f(x) = ln(x) and g(x) = x. The derivative of f(x) * g(x) is:\n\nf'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x) = 1/x * x + x * 1 = x + 1\n\nNow, we need to check if this matches the original function x*ln(x). Substituting x = u and dv = dx gives us:\n\ndv = 1/u * du\ndu = dx\n\nSo, integrating both sides gives:\n\n\u222b (1/u * du) = \u222b dx\n\nThis means that the derivative of the product of f(u) and g(x) is indeed equal to the original function x*ln(x).\n\nNow, we can proceed with integration by parts:\n\nI(x) = \u222b x*ln(x) dx\n\nLet's integrate f(u) = ln(u):\n\n\u222b ln(u) du = u * ln(u) - \u222b u * d(ln(u))\n\nThe derivative of u * ln(u) is u * ln(u) + u, but since we are integrating from x to x, the derivative term becomes zero. So, we have:\n\n\u222b ln(u) du = u * ln(u) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, let's integrate g(x) = x:\n\n\u222b x dx = 1/2 * x^2 + C', where C' is the constant of integration for g(x).\n\nSubstituting back, we get:\n\nI(x) = \u222b x*ln(x) dx = [1/2 * x^2 * ln(x)] + C, where C = C'.\n\nNow, to evaluate the integral at x = 4, we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\n\nI(4) = [1/2 * 4^2 * ln(4)] + C\n\nEvaluating the integral at x = 4, we get:\n\nI(4) = [1/2 * 16 * ln(4)] + C\n\nSince we don't know the constant of integration C, we cannot provide a specific integer result without it. However, if you want to round down the result to the nearest integer, you would do so after finding the value of C."}, {"role": "user", "content": "x*ln(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8981\u6c42\u89e3 $x \\cdot \\ln(x)$ \u7684\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8003\u8651\u51fd\u6570 $f(x) = x \\cdot \\ln(x)$ \u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u5bfc\u6570\u3002\n\n1. **\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df**\uff1a\u7531\u4e8e $\\ln(x)$ \u5728 $x > 0$ \u65f6\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64 $f(x)$ \u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u57df\u4e3a $(0, +\\infty)$\u3002\n\n2. **\u6c42\u5bfc**\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e58\u79ef\u6cd5\u5219\u5bf9 $f(x)$ \u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u5bfc\u3002\n\n\\[ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} [x \\cdot \\ln(x)] \\]\n\n\u6839\u636e\u4e58\u79ef\u6cd5\u5219\uff1a\n\n\\[ f'(x) = \\ln(x) + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} \\]\n\n\u7b80\u5316\u540e\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n\n\\[ f'(x) = \\ln(x) + 1 \\]\n\n3. **\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570**\uff1a\u7ee7\u7eed\u5bf9 $f'(x)$ \u6c42\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u3002\n\n\\[ f''(x) = \\frac{d}{dx} [\\ln(x) + 1] \\]\n\n\\[ f''(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\]\n\n4. **\u6781\u503c\u70b9**\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u5bfc\u6570 $f'(x)$ \u6765\u5bfb\u627e\u6781\u503c\u70b9\u3002\u4ee4 $f'(x) = 0$\uff1a\n\n\\[ \\ln(x) + 1 = 0 \\]\n\n\\[ \\ln(x) = -1 \\]\n\n\\[ x = e^{-1} = \\frac{1}{e} \\]\n\n5. **\u6781\u503c\u6027\u8d28**\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\u6570\u5224\u65ad\u6781\u503c\u70b9\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002\u5f53 $x = \\frac{1}{e}$ \u65f6\uff0c$f''(x) = e > 0$\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u70b9\u3002\n\n6. **\u6781\u5c0f\u503c**\uff1a\u8ba1\u7b97 $f(x)$ \u5728 $x = \\frac{1}{e}$ \u5904\u7684\u503c\uff1a\n\n\\[ f\\left(\\frac{1}{e}\\right) = \\frac{1}{e} \\cdot \\ln\\left(\\frac{1}{e}\\right) = \\frac{1}{e} \\cdot (-1) = -\\frac{1}{e} \\]\n\n\u7efc\u4e0a\u6240\u8ff0\uff0c\u51fd\u6570 $f(x) = x \\cdot \\ln(x)$ \u5728 $x = \\frac{1}{e}$ \u5904\u53d6\u5f97\u6781\u5c0f\u503c $-\\frac{1}{e}$\u3002"}]
