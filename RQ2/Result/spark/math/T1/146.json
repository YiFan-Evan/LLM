Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nThe integral of sinh(x) with respect to x is:\nI_sinh(x) = -cosh(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, let's integrate 1/x with respect to x:\nI_1_over_x(x) = ln|x| + C', where C' is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we can substitute these results into the original function and perform integration by parts again:\n\nI(x) = sinh(x) * I_1_over_x(x) - I_sinh(x) * dx\n     = sinh(x) * (ln|x| + C') - (-cosh(x) + C) * dx\n     = sinh(x) * ln|x| + cosh(x) * C' - cosh(x) * x + C * dx\n\nSince we want to find the result at a specific point x=4, we can substitute x=4 into the above expression:\n\nI(4) = sinh(4) * ln|4| + cosh(4) * C' - cosh(4) * 4 + C * dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the constants C and C'. Since they are constants of integration, they can be any real numbers. However, for simplicity, we can choose them to be zero:\n\nC = 0, C' = 0\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for I(4):\n\nI(4) = sinh(4) * ln|4| - cosh(4) * 4\n     = sinh(4) * ln(4) - cosh(4) * 4\n     = 3.762201279522851 * ln(4) - 2.761261207255143 * 4\n     = 3.762201279522851 * 1.3862943611198906 - 11.045304917803368\n     = 5.073385638382833\n\nFinally, since we need an integer result, we round down to the nearest integer:\n\nI(4) = 5\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of sinh(x)/(1/x) evaluated at x=4 is approximately 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sinh(x)/(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97 $\\frac{\\sinh(x)}{1/x}$\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u77e5\u9053\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5f26\u51fd\u6570 $\\sinh(x)$ \u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u662f\uff1a\n$$\\sinh(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$$\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c$\\frac{\\sinh(x)}{1/x}$ \u53ef\u4ee5\u5199\u6210\uff1a\n$$\\frac{\\sinh(x)}{1/x} = \\sinh(x) \\cdot x$$\n\n\u5c06 $\\sinh(x)$ \u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4ee3\u5165\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n$$\\sinh(x) \\cdot x = \\left(\\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}\\right) \\cdot x$$\n\n\u7b80\u5316\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n$$\\frac{x(e^x - e^{-x})}{2}$$\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c$\\frac{\\sinh(x)}{1/x}$ \u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a\n$$\\frac{x(e^x - e^{-x})}{2}$$"}]
