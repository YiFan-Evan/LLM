Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions. The basic idea is to express the integral as the difference of simpler integrals, and then solve for one of the integrals using the original function.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = 1/x. Then du/dx = e^x and v = ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\nI(x) = [e^x * ln|x|] - [e^x * (1/x)] + C\n\nNow, let's integrate both sides from 0 to x:\n\nI(x) - I(0) = [e^x * ln|x|] - [e^x * (1/x)] + C - 0\n\nThis gives us:\n\nI(x) = [e^x * ln|x|] - [e^x * (1/x)] + C\n\nSince we want to find the value of the integral at x=4, we substitute x=4 into each term:\n\nI(4) = [e^4 * ln|4|] - [e^4 * (1/4)] + C\n\nNow, let's evaluate these expressions:\n\nI(4) = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * (1/4)] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * ln(4)] - [e^4 * 1/4] + C\n     = [e^4 * "}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x*(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u51fd\u6570 $e^x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}$ \u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\uff1a\n$$ e^x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{e^x}{x} $$\n\n\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u8003\u8651\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u5bfc\u6216\u8005\u79ef\u5206\u7b49\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u6c42\u5b83\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u5546\u7684\u6c42\u5bfc\u6cd5\u5219\u3002\u8bbe $u = e^x$ \u548c $v = x$\uff0c\u5219\u6839\u636e\u5546\u7684\u6c42\u5bfc\u6cd5\u5219\uff1a\n$$ \\left( \\frac{u}{v} \\right)' = \\frac{u'v - uv'}{v^2} $$\n\n\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c$u' = e^x$ \u548c $v' = 1$\uff0c\u4ee3\u5165\u516c\u5f0f\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n$$ \\left( \\frac{e^x}{x} \\right)' = \\frac{e^x \\cdot x - e^x \\cdot 1}{x^2} = \\frac{e^x (x - 1)}{x^2} $$\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u51fd\u6570 $e^x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x}$ \u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u4e3a\uff1a\n$$ \\frac{d}{dx} \\left( \\frac{e^x}{x} \\right) = \\frac{e^x (x - 1)}{x^2} $$\n\n\u5982\u679c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ee7\u7eed\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002"}]
