Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product is equal to the original function. Then, you integrate one part and differentiate the other part.\n\nLet's choose f(x) = ln(x) and g(x) = x + 1. We want to find a function F(x) such that:\n\nd/dx [F(x) * g(x)] = f(x)\n\nDifferentiating both sides gives us:\n\ng(x) * d/dx F(x) + F(x) * d/dx g(x) = d/dx f(x)\n\nNow, let's differentiate both sides with respect to x:\n\nd/dx [g(x) * F(x)] = d/dx f(x)\n\nThis means that:\n\ng(x) * F(x) - F(x) * g'(x) = f(x) + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we need to find F(x). We can do this by integrating both sides of the equation:\n\n\u222b (g(x) * F(x)) dx = \u222b (f(x) + C) dx\n\nIntegrating both sides, we get:\n\n\u222b g(x) * F(x) dx = \u222b f(x) dx + C * \u222b dx\n\nNow, we can integrate each term separately:\n\n\u222b g(x) * F(x) dx = \u222b (x + 1) * F(x) dx = F(x) * (x + 1) - F(x) + C * x + C\n\nSince we want to find the indefinite integral of ln(x)*(1+x), we can set up the equation:\n\nI(x) = \u222b ln(x) * (1+x) dx\n\nSubstituting the expression for F(x) from above, we get:\n\nI(x) = \u222b ln(x) * (1+x) dx = [F(x) * (x + 1) - F(x) + C * x + C] + C\n\nNow, we can solve for F(x):\n\nF(x) = (ln(x) * (1+x)) - (x + 1) + C\n\nFinally, we can substitute 'x=4' into the expression for F(x):\n\nF(4) = (ln(4) * (1+4)) - (4 + 1) + C\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of F(4) using the given values of x and C. However, since we don't have a specific value for C, we cannot provide a final answer without it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(x)*(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u51fd\u6570 $f(x) = \\ln(x) \\cdot (1 + x)$ \u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5c55\u5f00\uff1a\n\\[ f(x) = \\ln(x) \\cdot (1 + x) = \\ln(x) + x \\ln(x) \\]\n\n\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u5bfc\uff0c\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u5b83\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u3002\n\n\u8bbe $u = \\ln(x)$ \u548c $v = 1 + x$\uff0c\u5219 $f(x) = u \\cdot v$\u3002\n\n\u6839\u636e\u4e58\u79ef\u6cd5\u5219\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6709\uff1a\n\\[ f'(x) = u' \\cdot v + u \\cdot v' \\]\n\n\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c$u' = \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(x) = \\frac{1}{x}$\uff0c$v' = \\frac{d}{dx} (1 + x) = 1$\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\n\\[ f'(x) = \\frac{1}{x} \\cdot (1 + x) + \\ln(x) \\cdot 1 \\]\n\\[ f'(x) = \\frac{1 + x}{x} + \\ln(x) \\]\n\\[ f'(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\ln(x) \\]\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u51fd\u6570 $f(x) = \\ln(x) \\cdot (1 + x)$ \u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u4e3a\uff1a\n\\[ f'(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\ln(x) \\]\n\n\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a\uff1a\n\\[ f'(x) = 1 + \\frac{1}{x} + \\ln(x) \\]"}]
