Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions. The basic idea is to express the integral as the difference of two simpler integrals, and then evaluate each of these separately.\n\nLet's choose u = x and dv = 1/x. Then du/dx = dx/dx = 1, and v = ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n\nI(x) = \u222b (1+x)/x dx\n     = \u222b (1/x) du + \u222b (1/x) d(ln|x| + C)\n     = ln|x| - ln|x| + C + C\n     = 2C\n\nSince there is no constant of integration specified, we can choose any real number for C.
