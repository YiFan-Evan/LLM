[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express the integral of a product of two functions as the difference of integrals of their derivatives.\n\nThe steps are:\n1. Choose u and v such that du/dx = dv/dx and u * dv = f(x) dx.\n2. Integrate both sides of the equation.\n3. Solve for the integral of f(x).\n\nFor our function sinh(x)*x, let's choose u = x and v = sinh(x). Then:\ndu/dx = dx/dx = 1\ndv/dx = cosh(x) dx\nu * dv = x * cosh(x) dx\n\nNow, integrate both sides:\nI(x) = x * cosh(x) - cosh(x) + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral gives:\nI(4) = 4 * cosh(4) - cosh(4) + C\n\nTo get the integer result by rounding down, we need to evaluate the expression and then take the floor of the result. Here's how you can do it using Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the function\ndef integrand(x):\n    return math.sinh(x) * x\n\n# Calculate the indefinite integral at x=4\nresult = 4 * math.cosh(4) - math.cosh(4)\n\n# Round down to the nearest integer\ninteger_result = math.floor(result)\n\nprint(integer_result)\n```\n\nPlease note that the constant of integration (C) is not specified, so the result will be different depending on the value of C chosen. If you want a specific value for C, you would need to specify it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sinh(x)*x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97 $\\sinh(x) \\cdot x$\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5f26\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1a\n$$\\sinh(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2}$$\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c$\\sinh(x) \\cdot x$ \u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\uff1a\n$$\\sinh(x) \\cdot x = x \\cdot \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} = \\frac{x (e^x - e^{-x})}{2}$$\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c$\\sinh(x) \\cdot x$ \u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e3a\uff1a\n$$\\sinh(x) \\cdot x = \\frac{x (e^x - e^{-x})}{2}$$"}]
