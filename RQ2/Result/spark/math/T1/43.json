Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions. The basic idea is to express one function as the derivative of another, and then integrate the new function.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = cos(x). Then:\n\ndu/dx = e^x  (the derivative of e^x)\ndv/dx = -sin(x) (the derivative of cos(x))\n\nNow, we can apply the integration by parts formula:\n\nI(x) = \u222be^x * cos(x) dx = [e^x * sin(x)] - \u222be^x * sin(x) dx\n\nThe second term on the right-hand side is an integral of a product of two functions, which can be integrated again using integration by parts. We can choose u = sin(x) and dv = e^x, and repeat the process until we get a result that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions.\n\nAfter several applications of integration by parts, we will end up with a result that involves the exponential function and trigonometric functions. However, this result will not be in a standard form that can be easily evaluated at a specific point like x=4.\n\nTo evaluate the integral at x=4, we would need to use numerical methods or special functions that are specifically designed for evaluating such integrals. For example, we could use software like Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha to compute the value of the integral at x=4.\n\nIf you want me to provide the exact expression for the indefinite integral without evaluating it at x=4, please let me know."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x*cos(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u51fd\u6570 $e^x \\cos(x)$ \u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e58\u79ef\u6cd5\u5219\u6765\u6c42\u5bfc\u6570\u3002\u8bbe $u = e^x$ \u548c $v = \\cos(x)$\uff0c\u5219\uff1a\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x \\cos(x)) = u'v + uv'\n\\]\n\n\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c$u' = \\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$\uff0c$v' = \\frac{d}{dx} \\cos(x) = -\\sin(x)$\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x \\cos(x)) = e^x \\cos(x) - e^x \\sin(x)\n\\]\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c$e^x \\cos(x)$ \u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n\\[\ne^x (\\cos(x) - \\sin(x))\n\\]\n\n\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{e^x (\\cos(x) - \\sin(x))}\n\\]"}]
