Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express the integral of a product of two functions as the difference of integrals of the individual functions, with one integrated over a smaller interval.\n\nThe steps are:\n\n1. Choose u and d such that du/dx = dx/du. In this case, let u = e^(1+x) and d = dx.\n2. Integrate u and d separately.\n3. Substitute the results back into the formula for the integral of a product.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps:\n\n1. Choose u = e^(1+x) and d = dx. Then du/dx = e^(1+x) * dx/dx = e^(1+x) * dx.\n2. Integrate u: Iu = e^(1+x) + C (where C is the constant of integration).\n3. Integrate d: Id = x + C' (where C' is another constant of integration).\n4. Substitute the results back into the formula for the integral of a product: I(x) = Iu - Id = e^(1+x) + C - (x + C') = e^(1+x) - x - C + C'.\n\nSince we want to find the value of the integral at x=4, we need to substitute x=4 into the expression for I(x):\n\nI(4) = e^(1+4) - 4 - C + C'.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the constants C and C'. Since they are constants of integration, they do not affect the final result when substituting x=4. Therefore, we can ignore them and just calculate the value of the expression without them:\n\nI(4) = e^5 - 4.\n\nFinally, we round down the result to get the integer part:\n\nI(4) = floor(e^5 - 4) = floor(148.4131591025766 - 4) = floor(144.4131591025766) = 144."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f $e^{1+x}$ \u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u6307\u6570\u90e8\u5206\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u6307\u6570\uff1a\n\n$$e^{1+x} = e^1 \\cdot e^x$$\n\n\u7531\u4e8e $e^1 = e$\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n$$e^{1+x} = e \\cdot e^x$$\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a\n\n$$e^{1+x} = e \\cdot e^x$$"}]
