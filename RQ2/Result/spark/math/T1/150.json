[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions. The basic idea is to express one function as the derivative of another, and then integrate the resulting expression.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = sin(x). Then:\n\ndu/dx = e^x  (the derivative of e^x)\ndv/dx = cos(x) (the derivative of sin(x))\n\nNow, we need to find the integrals of these functions:\n\nI(x) = \u222be^x * sin(x) dx\n     = [e^x * cos(x)] - \u222be^x * d(cos(x)) dx\n     = [e^x * cos(x)] - \u222be^x * (-sin(x)) dx\n     = [e^x * cos(x)] + \u222be^x * sin(x) dx\n\nOops! We have just rewritten the original integral in terms of itself. This means that the integral of e^x*sin(x) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. In other words, it is not possible to find an antiderivative for this function using the functions commonly used in calculus (polynomials, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc.).\n\nHowever, if you are interested in numerical approximations, you can use software or online calculators to evaluate the integral at specific points or over intervals. For example, you could use Wolfram Alpha or any symbolic mathematics software to get an approximate value of the integral."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x*sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u51fd\u6570 $e^x \\sin(x)$ \u8fdb\u884c\u89e3\u6790\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e58\u79ef\u6cd5\u5219\u6765\u6c42\u5bfc\u6570\u3002\u8bbe $u = e^x$ \u548c $v = \\sin(x)$\uff0c\u5219\uff1a\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x \\sin(x)) = u'v + uv'\n\\]\n\n\u5176\u4e2d\uff0c$u' = \\frac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$\uff0c$v' = \\frac{d}{dx} \\sin(x) = \\cos(x)$\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{dx}(e^x \\sin(x)) = e^x \\cdot \\sin(x) + e^x \\cdot \\cos(x)\n\\]\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c$e^x \\sin(x)$ \u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n\\[\ne^x (\\sin(x) + \\cos(x))\n\\]\n\n\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{e^x (\\sin(x) + \\cos(x))}\n\\]"}]
