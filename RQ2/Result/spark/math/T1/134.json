Let's denote the function as f(x) = e^sin(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express the integral of a product of two functions as the difference of integrals of their derivatives.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = sin(x) dx. Then, du/dx = e^x and v = -cos(x).\n\nApplying integration by parts:\n\n\u222be^sin(x) dx = [e^x * (-cos(x))] - \u222b(-cos(x)) * (e^x) dx\n\nThe second term on the right side is the derivative of the first term with respect to x, which is zero because the derivative of e^x * (-cos(x)) with respect to x is just e^x * (-sin(x)).\n\nTherefore, the integral of e^sin(x) dx is equal to e^x * (-cos(x)) at x = 0, which is -e^0 * cos(0) = -1.\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of e^sin(x) dx is -1 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, if you want to substitute x=4 into this expression, you would get:\n\n-1 + C = -1 + C\n\nSince C is a constant, substituting any value for x will not change the result.
