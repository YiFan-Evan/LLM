Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express the integral of a product of two functions as the difference of integrals of their derivatives.\n\nLet's start with the first part:\nsin(u) = u\n\nNow, let's differentiate both sides:\nd/dx [sin(u)] = cos(u) * du\n\nNow, let's substitute u = cos(x):\nd/dx [sin(cos(x))] = cos(cos(x)) * d/dx [cos(x)]\n\nThe derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), so:\nd/dx [sin(cos(x))] = -sin(x) * sin(cos(x))\n\nNow, let's integrate both sides:\n\u222b d/dx [sin(cos(x))] = -\u222b sin(x) * sin(cos(x)) dx\n\nNow, let's integrate the right side:\n-\u222b sin(x) * sin(cos(x)) dx = -[-cos(x) * sin(x)] + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, let's simplify the expression:\n-cos(x) * sin(x) + C = -cos(x) * sin(x) + C\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of sin(cos(x)) is:\nI(x) = -cos(x) * sin(x) + C\n\nNow, if you want to evaluate this at x = 4, you would substitute x = 4 into the expression:\nI(4) = -cos(4) * sin(4) + C\n\nHowever, since you asked for the integer result rounded down, we need to calculate the value and then round it down to the nearest integer. Here's how you could do that in Python:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Define the function\ndef f(x):\n    return -math.cos(x) * math.sin(x)\n\n# Evaluate the function at x = 4\nresult = f(4)\n\n# Round down to the nearest integer\ninteger_result = math.floor(result)\n\nprint(integer_result)\n```\n\nPlease note that the constant of integration (C) is not specified, so the exact value of C will depend on the specific context or problem statement. If you have a specific value for C, you should substitute it into the expression above before evaluating at x = 4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sin(cos(x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8981\u6c42\u89e3 $\\sin(\\cos(x))$ \u7684\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u590d\u5408\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n\n1. \u8bbe $u = \\cos(x)$\uff0c\u5219\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6c42 $\\sin(u)$\u3002\n2. \u7531\u4e8e $\\cos(x)$ \u7684\u503c\u57df\u4e3a $[-1, 1]$\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64 $u$ \u7684\u53d6\u503c\u8303\u56f4\u4e5f\u662f $[-1, 1]$\u3002\n3. \u5728 $[-1, 1]$ \u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0c$\\sin(u)$ \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6b63\u5f26\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u4e00\u6761\u6ce2\u52a8\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c$\\sin(\\cos(x))$ \u7684\u89e3\u6790\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5c31\u662f\uff1a\n$$\\sin(\\cos(x))$$\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u662f\u5148\u5bf9 $x$ \u8fdb\u884c\u4f59\u5f26\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5f26\u8fd0\u7b97\u3002"}]
