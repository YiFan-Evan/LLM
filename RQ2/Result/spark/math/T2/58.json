Let's denote the function as f(x) = e^(x^2).\n\nThe first step is to find a suitable function u(x) and v'(x) such that u'(x) = v(x) and v'(x) = f(x). \n\nA common choice for u(x) is x, which gives us u'(x) = 1. For v(x), we can choose e^(-x^2), which satisfies v'(x) = -2xe^(-x^2).\n\nNow, let's integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = \u222b u(x) dv(x)\n\nSubstituting u(x) = x and v(x) = e^(-x^2), we get:\n\n\u222b e^(x^2) dx = x * e^(-x^2) + \u222b e^(-x^2) dx\n\nThe second term on the right side is straightforward to integrate:\n\n\u222b e^(-x^2) dx = -e^(-x^2) + C,\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of e^(x^2) is:\n\n\u222b e^(x^2) dx = x * e^(-x^2) - e^(-x^2) + C.\n\nNow, if we substitute x = 4 into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222b e^(x^2) dx |_(x=4) = 4 * e^(-16) - e^(-16) + C.\n\nFinally, to round down the result to an integer, we would take the floor of the value. However, since the result includes an exponential function with a negative exponent, the value will be very close to zero (or even negative), so rounding down to the nearest integer will likely yield zero or a negative integer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x^2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = 5e^{x^2} \\), we will use the chain rule.
