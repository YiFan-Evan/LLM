The range of \\(\\cos(x)\\) is \\([-1, 1]\\). Then, we apply the outer function \\(\\sin\\) to this range. The range of \\(\\sin(y)\\) where \\( y \\in [-1, 1] \\) is \\([\\sin(-1), \\sin(1)]\\). Since \\(\\sin(-1) = -\\sin(1)\\), the range of \\(\\sin(\\cos(x))\\) is approximately \\([-0.8415, 0.8415]\\).

Therefore, \\( f(x) = 5 \\cdot \\sin(\\cos(x))\\) is periodic with period \\(2\\pi\\).\n\n4. **Symmetry**: Since \\(\\cos(x)\\) is an even function and \\(\\sin\\) is an odd function, the composition \\(\\sin(\\cos(x))\\) is an even function.
