Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions. The basic idea is to express one function as the derivative of another, and then integrate the new function.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = sin(x). Then:\n\ndu/dx = e^x  (the derivative of e^x)\ndv/dx = cos(x) (the derivative of sin(x))\n\nNow, we need to find the integrals of these functions:\n\nI(x) = \u222be^x * sin(x) dx\n     = [e^x * cos(x)] - \u222be^x * d(cos(x)) dx\n     = [e^x * cos(x)] - \u222be^x * (-sin(x)) dx\n     = [e^x * cos(x)] + \u222be^x * sin(x) dx\n\nOops! We have just rewritten the original function. This means that the integral of e^x*sin(x) with respect to x cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, we can still evaluate it numerically at specific points or use symbolic software like Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha to get an approximate result.\n\nIf you want to evaluate the integral at x=4, you would need to use numerical methods or symbolic software. For example, using Python's `sympy` library, you could do something like this:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, sin, integrate\n\nx = symbols('x')\nf = exp(x) * sin(x)\nintegral_f = integrate(f, x)\nresult_at_4 = integral_f.subs(x, 4)\nprint(result_at_4)\n```\n\nThis will give you the value of the integral at x=4, but keep in mind that it might not be an exact integer due to the complexity of the function."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function $5(e^x \\sin(x))$, we can use the same integration by parts method as before, but now we have a constant multiplier outside the integral. This multiplier can be taken out of the integral because it is a constant with respect to the variable of integration.\n\nLet's denote the indefinite integral as $I(x)$:\n\n$$ I(x) = \\int 5(e^x \\sin(x)) \\, dx $$\n\nSince the constant factor of 5 does not depend on $x$, it can be taken out of the integral:\n\n$$ I(x) = 5 \\int e^x \\sin(x) \\, dx $$\n\nNow, we apply integration by parts to the integral inside:\n\n1.

The result will be a real number, which you can then round down to get an integer."}]
