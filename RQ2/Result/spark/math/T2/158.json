Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express the integral of a product of two functions as the difference of integrals of the individual functions, with one integrated over a region and the other multiplied by the first.\n\nThe steps are:\n1. Choose u = e^x and dv = sin(u)\n2. Compute du/dx = e^x and dv/du = cos(u)\n3. Integrate both sides of the equation:\n\nI(x) = [sin(u)] from u=0 to u=e^x - (cos(u)) from x=0 to x=I(x)\n\nNow, let's solve for I(x):\n\nI(x) = [-cos(u)] from u=0 to u=e^x + C\n\nSince we want to substitute x=4, we need to evaluate the integral at x=4:\n\nI(4) = [-cos(u)] from u=0 to u=e^4 + C\n\nNow, we can calculate the value of this integral using numerical methods or symbolic computation software like Mathematica or Python's SymPy library. Here's how you could do it in Python using SymPy:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, exp, sin, cos, integrate\n\nx = symbols('x')\nu = symbols('u', cls=Function)\n\n# Define the integrands\nintegrand_u = exp(x)\nintegrand_v = sin(u)\n\n# Perform integration by parts\npart1 = integrate(integrand_v, u)\npart2 = integrate(part1.subs(u, integrand_u), x)\n\n# Substitute x=4\nresult = part2.subs(x, 4)\n\nprint(\"The result of the integral at x=4 is:\", result)\n```\n\nThis code will output the result of the integral at x=4 after performing the integration by parts. Note that the constant of integration C is not specified, so the result will include a constant of integration. If you want just the integral without the constant, you would need to specify a particular value for C or perform additional calculations to determine its value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sin(e^x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function $5 \\cdot \\sin(e^x)$, we can use a similar approach as before, but now we need to account for the constant multiplier outside the sine function.\n\n### Step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Choose u and dv**:\n   - Let $ u = e^x $.\n   - Then $ du = e^x \\, dx $ or $ dx = \\frac{du}{e^x} = \\frac{du}{u} $.\n   - Let $ dv = 5 \\sin(u) \\, du $.\n\n2. **Integrate u and v**:\n   - Integrating $ u $ from 0 to $ e^x $ gives $ u - \\ln(u) $ (not used here).\n   - Integrating $ dv $ gives $ 5 \\int \\sin(u) \\, du = -5 \\cos(u) $.\n\n3. **Apply integration by parts formula**:\n   - The formula is $ \\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du $.\n   - Here, $ v = -5 \\cos(u) $ and $ u = e^x $.\n   - Therefore, $ \\int 5 \\sin(e^x) \\, dx = 5 e^x \\cos(e^x) - \\int -5 \\cos(e^x) e^x \\, dx $.\n\n4. **Simplify the second integral**:\n   - The second integral becomes $ 5 \\int e^x \\cos(e^x) \\, dx $.\n   - Let $ w = e^x $, then $ dw = e^x \\, dx $ or $ dx = \\frac{dw}{e^x} = \\frac{dw}{w} $.\n   - Thus, $ 5 \\int w \\cos(w) \\frac{dw}{w} = 5 \\int \\cos(w) \\, dw = 5 \\sin(w) $.\n\n5. **Combine results**:\n   - The final integral is $ 5 e^x \\cos(e^x) - 5 \\sin(e^x) + C $.\n\n### Substitute $ x = 4 $:\n- Evaluate $ e^4 \\approx 54.6 $.\n- Calculate $ \\cos(54.6) $ and $ \\sin(54.6) $.\n- Finally, compute $ 5 \\cdot 54.6 \\cdot \\cos(54.6) - 5 \\cdot \\sin(54.6) $.\n\nThis result will give you the value of the integral at $ x = 4 $.
