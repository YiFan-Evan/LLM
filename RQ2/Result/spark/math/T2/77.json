However, we can use integration by parts to attempt an expression. Let's set:\n- $ u = 1+x $ so that $ du = dx $\n- $ dv = \\frac{1}{\\ln(x)} dx $ which implies $ v $ is the integral of $ \\frac{1}{\\ln(x)} $\n\nUnfortunately, $ \\int \\frac{1}{\\ln(x)} \\, dx $ does not have a simple form in terms of elementary functions. This integral is related to the logarithmic integral function, denoted as $\\text{Li}(x)$. Therefore, the integral of $ f(x) $ would involve this special function, which is beyond elementary calculus.\n\n### Step 2: Evaluating at $ x = 4 $\nSince we cannot express the integral in elementary terms, we cannot directly compute the definite integral at $ x = 4 $ without using numerical methods or special functions. However, if we were to approximate or use numerical methods, we would proceed as follows:\n\n1. Use a numerical integration method (such as Simpson's rule or numerical quadrature) to estimate the value of the integral from some lower limit (e.g., 1, since $\\ln(x)$ is undefined at $x=0$) to $x = 4$.\n2. Alternatively, use software or a calculator that can handle special functions like the logarithmic integral to evaluate $\\text{Li}(4)$.\n\n### Step 3: Rounding Down\nOnce we have the numerical value of the integral at $ x = 4 $, we round down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Conclusion\nGiven the complexity and the non-elementary nature of the integral involved, providing a precise integer result without computational tools or approximations is not feasible within the scope of this platform. If you have access to mathematical software or a capable calculator, I recommend using it to evaluate $\\text{Li}(4)$ or directly computing the numerical integral from an appropriate lower limit to $x = 4$, and then rounding down the result."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1+x)/ln(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem, we first need to find the indefinite integral of the function $5 \\cdot \\frac{1+x}{\\ln(x)}$.
