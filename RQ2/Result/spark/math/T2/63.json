Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product is equal to the original function. Then, we integrate one part and differentiate the other part.\n\nLet's choose f(x) = x and g(x) = e^-x. Their derivatives are f'(x) = 1 and g'(x) = -e^-x.\n\nThe derivative of f(x) * g(x) is then:\nf'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x) = 1 * e^-x + x * (-e^-x) = x - x * e^-x.\n\nNow, let's compare this with the original function x^2/e^x:\nx^2/e^x = (x - x * e^-x) / e^x\n\nWe can simplify this expression:\nx^2/e^x = x - x * e^-x / e^x\nx^2/e^x = x - x * e^-x\n\nNow, let's integrate each part:\nI(x) = \u222b x dx - \u222b x * e^-x dx\nI(x) = [1/2]x^2 - \u222b e^-x dx\n\nIntegrating the second part, we get:\nI(x) = [1/2]x^2 - (-e^-x + C)\n\nSince we want to find the indefinite integral without the constant of integration, we can ignore the constant C:\nI(x) = [1/2]x^2 + e^-x\n\nNow, substituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral gives us:\nI(4) = [1/2]*4^2 + e^-4\nI(4) = 8 + e^-4\n\nFinally, to round down to the nearest integer, we would take the floor of the result:\nfloor(I(4)) = floor(8 + e^-4)\n\nHowever, since I cannot evaluate e^-4 here, you would need to calculate it using a calculator or software to get the exact value.
