Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions. The basic idea is to express the integral as the difference of two simpler integrals, and then evaluate each of these separately.\n\nLet's choose u = x and dv = 1/x.
