However, for all other values of x where x \u2260 0, the function can be evaluated as follows:\n\nf(x) = x^2 / x\n\nTo find the indefinite integral of this function with respect to x, we use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv/dx = x^2 / x. Then du/dx = 1 and v = \u222b x^2 dx = x^3 / 3 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstituting these into the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = uv - \u222b v du\n            = x * (x^3 / 3 + C) - \u222b (x^3 / 3 + C) * dx\n            = x^4 / 4 + Cx - \u222b (x^3 / 3 + C) dx\n\nSince the derivative of (x^3 / 3 + C) is x^2, we can integrate it directly:\n\n\u222b (x^3 / 3 + C) dx = (x^4 / 4) + Cx^2 + D\n\nNow, we have two unknowns: C and D. Since we are looking for an antiderivative (the indefinite integral), we can choose any constant for D that makes the expression complete. For simplicity, let's choose D = 0.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of f(x) = x^2 / x with respect to x is:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = (x^4 / 4) + Cx^2\n\nFor the specific value of x = 4, we substitute into the expression:\n\n\u222b f(4) dx = (4^4 / 4) + C(4^2)\n          = 256/4 + C*16\n          = 64 + C*16\n\nSince we don't know the value of C, we cannot provide a final integer result without specifying it. However, if you want to round down the result to the nearest integer, you would do so by ignoring the fractional part of the result. In this case, the result would be:\n\n64 (rounded down from 64.0 + C*16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(x^2/x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To simplify the given function \\( 5 \\cdot \\frac{x^2}{x} \\), we can follow these steps:\n\n1.
