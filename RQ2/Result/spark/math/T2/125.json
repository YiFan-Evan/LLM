Then, $ du = -\\sin(x) \\, dx $ or $ dx = -\\frac{du}{\\sin(x)} $.\n\n### Step 2: Integral Transformation\nSubstitute $ x $ in terms of $ u $ into the integral:\n$$ \\int 5 \\sin(\\cos(x)) \\, dx = \\int 5 \\sin(u) \\left(-\\frac{du}{\\sin(x)}\\right) $$\n\nHowever, $ \\sin(x) $ cannot be directly related to $ u $ without further information or assumptions.

The Fresnel integrals are defined as:\n$$ S(z) = \\int_0^z \\sin(t^2) \\, dt $$\n$$ C(z) = \\int_0^z \\cos(t^2) \\, dt $$\n\nThe integral of $ \\sin(\\cos(x)) $ can be related to the Fresnel integrals, but it is not directly equivalent.

If you need a specific numerical value at $ x = 4 $, I recommend using a numerical integration tool or software."}]
