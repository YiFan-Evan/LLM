This will transform the function into a simpler form that can be integrated directly.\n\nThe derivative of u with respect to x is 2x, which matches the differential factor du. Therefore, the substitution is valid.\n\nLet's proceed with the integration:\n\n```python\nfrom sympy import symbols, sinh, integrate\n\nx = symbols('x')\nu = x**2\ndu = 2*x\n\n# Integrate sinh(u) with respect to u\nintegral_of_sinh_u = integrate(sinh(u), u)\n\n# Substitute back into the original variable x\nintegral_of_sinh_x_squared = integral_of_sinh_u.subs(u, x**2)\n\nprint(integral_of_sinh_x_squared)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the indefinite integral of sinh(x^2).
