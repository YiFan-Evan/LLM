Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express one part of the integrand as a derivative and the other part as an antiderivative.\n\nLet's choose u = x^2 and dv/dx = e^x/x. Then:\n\ndu/dx = 2x, and dv/dx = e^x/x + e^x.\n\nSubstituting these into the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\nI(x) = \u222b x^2 * e^x / x dx = \u222b u * dv/dx = uv - \u222b v * du/dx.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each term:\n\nu = x^2, so uv = x^3 * e^x.\n\ndv/dx = e^x/x + e^x, so v = (e^x/x) + C1, where C1 is the constant of integration.\n\ndu/dx = 2x, so dv = (e^x/x) + C1 * dx.\n\nSubstituting these back into the equation, we get:\n\nI(x) = x^3 * e^x - \u222b ((e^x/x) + C1) * 2x dx.\n\nNow, let's integrate the second term:\n\n\u222b ((e^x/x) + C1) * 2x dx = 2x * ((e^x/x) + C1) - \u222b 2C1 * e^x dx.\n\nThe first term is straightforward:\n\n2x * ((e^x/x) + C1) = 2x * (e^x + C1).\n\nFor the second term, we need to integrate 2C1 * e^x:\n\n\u222b 2C1 * e^x dx = 2C1 * e^x + C2, where C2 is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, combining everything, we have:\n\nI(x) = x^3 * e^x - 2x * (e^x + C1) + 2C1 * e^x + C2.\n\nSince we want to find the indefinite integral without the constant of integration, we can say that:\n\nI(x) = x^3 * e^x - 2x * (e^x + C1) + 2C1 * e^x.\n\nNow, if we substitute x=4 into this expression, we get:\n\nI(4) = 4^3 * e^4 - 2 * (4 * (e^4 + C1) + 2C1 * e^4).\n\nHowever, since we don't know the values of C1 and C2, we cannot provide a specific integer result for I(4) at this time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(x^2/e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = 5 \\cdot \\frac{x^2}{e^x} \\), we will use the quotient rule.
