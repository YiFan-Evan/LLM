Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express the integral of a product of two functions as the difference of integrals of the individual functions, with one integrated over a smaller interval.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = dx. Then:\n\ndu/dx = e^x dx\ndv/dx = dx\n\nNow, we substitute these into the integral:\n\nI(x) = \u222b e^x dx\n     = [e^x] - + C\n     = e^x - C\n\nSince we want to find the value of the integral at x = 4, we substitute x = 4 into the expression for I(x):\n\nI(4) = e^(1+4) - C\n     = e^5 - C\n\nThe constant of integration C can be any real number, so we cannot determine its exact value without additional information. However, if you are interested in finding the exact value of the integral at x = 4, you would need to specify the constant of integration C.\n\nIf you just want the integer part of the result when rounded down, we can do that too. In Python, you can use the `math` module to calculate e^5 and then round it down to the nearest integer using the `floor` function from the `math` module:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nresult = math.exp(5)  # Calculate e^5\nrounded_result = math.floor(result)  # Round down to the nearest integer\n\nprint(rounded_result)\n```\n\nThis will give you the integer part of e^5 rounded down."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^(1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = 5e^{1+x} \\), we will use the chain rule.\n\nThe chain rule states that if you have a composite function \\( f(g(x)) \\), then its derivative is given by:\n\\[ \\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x) \\]\n\nIn this case, let \\( u = 1 + x \\).
