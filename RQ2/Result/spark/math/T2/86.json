Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions, where one function is relatively easy to integrate and the other is relatively easy to differentiate.\n\nThe steps are:\n1. Choose u = e^x and dv = 1/cos(x)\n2. Integrate u with respect to x and v with respect to x separately.\n3. Substitute the results back into the formula for integration by parts.\n\nLet's start with the first step:\n\nu = e^x\ndv = 1/cos(x)\n\nNow, let's integrate u with respect to x:\n\ndu/dx = e^x\n\u222be^x dx = e^x + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n\nNext, let's integrate dv with respect to x:\n\ndv/dx = -sec(x)^2\n\u222b(-sec(x)^2) dx = -tan(x) - C\n\nNow, substitute these results back into the formula for integration by parts:\n\nI(x) = [e^x + C] - [-tan(x) - C]\nI(x) = e^x - tan(x) + C\n\nSince we want to find the indefinite integral, we need to remove the constant of integration C. However, since we don't know the value of C, we cannot remove it from the final result. The indefinite integral of e^x/cos(x) is therefore:\n\nI(x) = e^x - tan(x) + C\n\nNow, if you want to evaluate this at x = 4, you would substitute x = 4 into each term:\n\nI(4) = e^4 - tan(4) + C\n\nHowever, without knowing the value of C, we cannot provide an exact integer result.
