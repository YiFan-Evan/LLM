Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions, where one function is relatively easy to integrate and the other is relatively easy to differentiate.\n\nThe steps are:\n1. Choose u = e^x and dv = sin(x)\n2. Compute du/dx = e^x and dv/dx = cos(x)\n3. Integrate u with respect to x and v with respect to x separately\n4. Substitute the results back into the formula for integration by parts.\n\nLet's do it step by step:\n\n1. u = e^x, dv = sin(x)\n2. du/dx = e^x, dv/dx = cos(x)\n3. Integrating u with respect to x: \u222be^x dx = e^x + C (where C is the constant of integration)\n4. Integrating v with respect to x: \u222bsin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C' (where C' is another constant of integration)\n5. Substituting the results back into the formula for integration by parts:\n   \u222be^x/sin(x) dx = [e^x - cos(x)] + C - C'\n\nSince we want to find the indefinite integral without any constants of integration, we will simplify the result:\n\nI(x) = \u222be^x/sin(x) dx = e^x - cos(x) + C - C'\n\nNow, let's substitute 'x=4' into the result:\n\nI(4) = e^4 - cos(4) + C - C'\n\nTo get an integer result, we need to round down the value of this expression.
