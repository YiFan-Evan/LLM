Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to solve integrals that involve products of functions. The basic idea is to express one function as the derivative of another, and then integrate the derivative part.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = ln(x) dx. Then:\n\ndu/dx = e^x dx\ndv/dx = 1/x dx\n\nNow, we need to find u and v such that du/dx * dv/dx = u * dv. We have:\n\ne^x * (1/x) = e^x / x\n\nThis means that u = e^x and v = ln(x). Now, we can write the integral as:\n\nI(x) = [e^x * ln(x)] - \u222b e^x * (1/x) dx\n\nThe second term on the right-hand side is just the integral of 1/x, which is -ln(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of e^x/ln(x) is:\n\nI(x) = e^x * ln(x) - ln(x) + C\n\nNow, if you want to substitute x = 4 into this expression, you would get:\n\nI(4) = e^4 * ln(4) - ln(4) + C\n\nHowever, since you asked for an integer result by rounding down, we will ignore the constant of integration C and focus on the other terms.\n\nI(4) = e^4 * ln(4) - ln(4)\n\nNow, let's calculate these values:\n\ne^4 = 54.598150033144236\nln(4) = 1.3862943611198906\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression:\n\nI(4) = 54.598150033144236 * 1.3862943611198906 - 1.3862943611198906\nI(4) = 73.38275777922298 - 1.3862943611198906\nI(4) = 71.99646341809309\n\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\n\nI(4) = 71\n\nSo, the integer result of the expression after substituting x=4 and rounding down is 71."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x/ln(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = 5 \\cdot \\frac{e^x}{\\ln(x)} \\), we will use the quotient rule.
