The basic idea is to express the integral as the difference of two simpler integrals, and then solve for one of them using the original function.\n\nLet's start with the integration by parts:\n\n1. Choose u = x and dv/dx = sinh(x).\n2. Then, du/dx = dx/dx = 1, and v = -cosh(x).\n3. Integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n\u222b sinh(x) * x dx = u * v - \u222b v * du\n\nNow, let's evaluate each part:\n\nu * v = x * (-cosh(x)) = -x * cosh(x)\ndu = dx = 1\n\nSo, \u222b v * du = -cosh(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstituting this back into our equation, we get:\n\n\u222b sinh(x) * x dx = -x * cosh(x) + C\n\nSince we want to find the indefinite integral without the constant of integration, we can simply write:\n\n\u222b sinh(x) * x dx = -x * cosh(x) + C\n\nNow, if you want to substitute 'x=4' into this expression, you would replace x with 4 in the above equation:\n\n\u222b sinh(4) * 4 dx = -4 * cosh(4) + C\n\nFinally, to round down the result to the nearest integer, you would take the floor of the value obtained after substituting x=4. However, since the result includes a trigonometric function (cosh), it will not be an integer unless x=4 happens to give an exact integer result.
