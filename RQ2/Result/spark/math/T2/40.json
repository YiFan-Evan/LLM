Let's denote the function as f(x) = e^cos(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express the integral of a product of two functions as the difference of integrals of their derivatives.\n\nLet's choose u = e^cos(x) and dv/dx = 1, which gives us:\n\ndu/dx = -e^cos(x) * sin(x)\ndv/dx = dx\n\nNow, let's integrate both sides:\n\n\u222bf(x) dx = \u222bu * dv + \u222bv * du\n\nIntegrating u * dv, we get:\n\n\u222be^cos(x) dx = e^cos(x) * x + C_1\n\nIntegrating v * du, we get:\n\n\u222b1 dx = x + C_2\n\nSubtracting the second integral from the first, we get:\n\n\u222be^cos(x) dx - \u222b1 dx = e^cos(x) * x - x + C_1 - C_2\n\nSince C_1 and C_2 are constants of integration, they can be added or subtracted from each other without affecting the value of the integral. Therefore, we can simplify the expression to:\n\n\u222be^cos(x) dx = e^cos(x) * x - x + C\n\nNow, let's substitute x = 4 into the expression:\n\n\u222be^cos(4) dx = e^cos(4) * 4 - 4 + C\n\nEvaluating the cosine at 4 (which is cos(\u03c0)), we have:\n\ne^cos(4) = e^0 = 1\n\nTherefore, the integral of e^cos(x) with respect to x at x = 4 is:\n\n\u222be^cos(4) dx = 1 * 4 - 4 + C = 0 + C\n\nSince C is a constant, it does not affect the result when we round down to the nearest integer.
