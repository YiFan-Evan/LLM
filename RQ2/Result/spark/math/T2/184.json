Let's denote the indefinite integral as \\( F(x) \\).\n\nIntegration by parts involves choosing two functions, \\( u(x) \\) and \\( v(x) \\), such that \\( u'(x) \\) is easy to integrate and \\( v'(x) \\) is equal to the original function. Then, we can write:\n\n\\[ F(x) = \\int f(x) dx = \\int u(x) dv(x) \\]\n\nFor our function, let's choose \\( u(x) = x \\) and \\( v(x) = \\ln(1+x) \\). Then:\n\n\\[ u'(x) = 1 \\]\n\\[ v'(x) = \\frac{1}{1+x} \\]\n\nSubstituting these into the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\n\\[ F(x) = x \\ln(1+x) - \\int \\frac{1}{1+x} dx \\]\n\nThe second term on the right-hand side is a standard integral that can be evaluated using the substitution \\( t = 1+x \\):\n\n\\[ \\int \\frac{1}{1+x} dx = \\int \\frac{1}{t} dt = \\ln|t| + C \\]\n\nWhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.
