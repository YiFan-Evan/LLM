Therefore, the domain of the function is:\n\\[ x \\in (-\\infty, 0) \\cup (0, \\infty) \\]\n\n### Behavior:\n1. **At $x = 0$**: The function has a removable discontinuity at $x = 0$. To see this, note that as $x$ approaches 0, $\\cos(x)$ approaches 1, but $\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x}$ does not have a finite limit.\n2. **As $x \\to \\pm\\infty$**: The function $\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x}$ approaches 0 because $\\cos(x)$ is bounded between -1 and 1, while $x$ grows without bound.\n\n### Special Properties:\n- **Symmetry**: The function $\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x}$ is an even function because $\\cos(-x) = \\cos(x)$. Thus, $\\frac{\\cos(-x)}{-x} = -\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x}$.\n- **Periodicity**: The function $\\cos(x)$ is periodic with period $2\\pi$, but $\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x}$ is not periodic due to the division by $x$.\n\n### Derivative:\nTo find the derivative of $\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x}$, we use the quotient rule:\n\\[ f(x) = \\frac{\\cos(x)}{x} \\]\n\\[ f'(x) = \\frac{d}{dx}\\left(\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x}\\right) = \\frac{x(-\\sin(x)) - \\cos(x)(1)}{x^2} = \\frac{-x\\sin(x) - \\cos(x)}{x^2} \\]\n\n### Integral:\nThe integral of $\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x}$ does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. It is known as the cosine integral, denoted by $\\text{Ci}(x)$:\n\\[ \\int \\frac{\\cos(x)}{x} \\, dx = \\text{Ci}(x) + C \\]\nwhere $C$ is the constant of integration.\n\nIn summary, the function $\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x}$ is defined for all $x \\neq 0$, has a removable discontinuity at $x = 0$, and approaches 0 as $|x| \\to \\infty$.
