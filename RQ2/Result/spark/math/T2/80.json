Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product equals the original function. Then, you integrate one part and differentiate the other.\n\nFor our function (1/x^2), we can choose f(x) = 1 and g(x) = x^-2. The derivative of f(x) * g(x) is then:\n\nf'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x) = 0 + 2x^-3 = 2x^-3\n\nSince the derivative of f(x) * g(x) is the original function (1/x^2), we can write:\n\nI(x) = [f(x) * g(x)] - [f(x) * g(x)] = 0\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of (1/x^2) with respect to x is 0.\n\nNow, if we substitute x = 4 into the result, we get:\n\nI(4) = 0\n\nTherefore, the integer result of the expression when x = 4 is 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1/x^2))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = 5 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right) \\), we can use the power rule for differentiation.\n\nFirst, rewrite the function in a more convenient form:\n\\[ f(x) = 5 \\cdot x^{-2} \\]\n\nNow apply the power rule, which states that if \\( f(x) = x^n \\), then \\( f'(x) = n \\cdot x^{n-1} \\).\n\nDifferentiating \\( f(x) \\):\n\\[ f'(x) = 5 \\cdot (-2) \\cdot x^{-3} \\]\n\\[ f'(x) = -10 \\cdot x^{-3} \\]\n\\[ f'(x) = -\\frac{10}{x^3} \\]\n\nSo, the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = 5 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right) \\) is:\n\\[ f'(x) = -\\frac{10}{x^3} \\]"}]
