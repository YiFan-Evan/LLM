Let's denote the function as f(x) = e^(x^2).\n\nThe first step is to find a suitable function u(x) and v'(x) such that u'(x) = v(x) and v'(x) = f(x). \n\nA common choice for u(x) is x, which gives us u'(x) = 1. For v(x), we can choose e^(-x^2), which satisfies v'(x) = -2xe^(-x^2).\n\nNow, let's integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = \u222b u(x) dv(x)\n\n= [uv] - \u222b v(x) du(x)\n\n= [xe^(-x^2)] - \u222b e^(-x^2) dx\n\n= x e^(-x^2) + \u222b e^(-x^2) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the last integral.
