Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express one part of the integrand as a derivative and the other part as an antiderivative, then integrate them separately.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = cos(x) dx. Then:\n\ndu/dx = e^x dx\ndv/dx = -sin(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to find the integrals of these functions:\n\nI(x) = \u222be^x * cos(x) dx\n     = \u222bu * dv\n     = uv - \u222bv * du\n     = e^x * (-sin(x)) - \u222b(-sin(x)) * e^x dx\n     = -e^x * sin(x) + \u222bsin(x) * e^x dx\n\nNow, let's integrate the second part:\n\n\u222bsin(x) * e^x dx\n\nUsing integration by parts again with u = sin(x) and dv = e^x dx:\n\ndu/dx = cos(x) dx\ndv/dx = e^x dx\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\u222bsin(x) * e^x dx = sin(x) * e^x - \u222be^x * cos(x) dx\n\nSubstituting our earlier result for the last integral, we get:\n\n\u222bsin(x) * e^x dx = sin(x) * e^x - (-e^x * sin(x) + C)\n                  = e^x * sin(x) + e^x * sin(x) + C\n                  = 2e^x * sin(x) + C\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of e^x*cos(x) is:\n\nI(x) = \u222be^x * cos(x) dx = 2e^x * sin(x) + C\n\nNow, to evaluate this at x = 4, we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\n\nI(4) = 2e^4 * sin(4) + C\n\nSince you asked for the integer result rounded down, we will ignore the constant of integration C and round down the result of the integral at x = 4:\n\nI(4) = 2e^4 * sin(4)\n\nEvaluating this expression requires numerical methods or software since it involves exponential and trigonometric functions. However, if you want to know the exact value without using software, you would need to calculate e^4 and sin(4) first, which are both standard mathematical operations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x*cos(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = 5e^x \\cos(x) \\), we will use the product rule.
