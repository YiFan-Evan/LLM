Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express one part of the integral as an antiderivative and the other part as a derivative, then integrate them separately.\n\nLet's start with the integration by parts:\n\n1. Choose u = ln(x) and dv = cos(u), which gives du/dx = 1/x and v = sin(u).\n2. Integrate both sides of the equation:\n\nI(x) = \u222b cos(ln(x)) dx\n     = [sin(u)] * (du/dx) + \u222b (du/dx) / x dx\n     = [sin(u)] * (1/x) - \u222b (1/x^2) du\n     = [sin(u)] * (1/x) - (1/x) * cos(u) + C\n\nNow, let's substitute x = e^u for the second integral:\n\nI(x) = [sin(u)] * (1/x) - (1/x) * cos(u) + C\n     = [sin(u)] * (1/x) - (1/x) * cos(u) + C\n     = [sin(ln(x))] * (1/x) - (1/x) * cos(ln(x)) + C\n\nSince we want to evaluate the integral at x = 4, we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\n\nI(4) = [sin(ln(4))] * (1/4) - (1/4) * cos(ln(4)) + C\n      = [sin(1)] * (1/4) - (1/4) * cos(1) + C\n      = (0.5403023058681398) * (1/4) - (1/4) * (0.8414709848078965) + C\n      = 0.1353352832366127 - 0.2092151775607983 + C\n      = 0.0261000043338835 + C\n\nThe constant of integration C can be any real number, so we cannot determine its exact value without additional information. However, if you need the result rounded down to the nearest integer, we can do that:\n\nI(4) \u2248 0.0261000043338835 rounded down = 0\n\nSo, the integer result of the expression when x = 4 is 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(cos(ln(x)))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the derivative of the function \\( f(x) = 5 \\cos(\\ln(x)) \\), we will use the chain rule.
