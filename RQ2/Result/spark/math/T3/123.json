Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product is equal to the original function. Then, you integrate one part and differentiate the other part.\n\nLet's choose f(x) = ln(x) and g(x) = x + 1. We will then apply integration by parts:\n\nI(x) = [f(x) * g(x)] - (\u222bf(x) * g'(x) dx)\n\nNow, let's find the derivative of g(x):\n\ng'(x) = 1, since the derivative of x + 1 is simply 1.\n\nSubstituting these values back into the formula, we get:\n\nI(x) = [ln(x) * (x + 1)] - \u222bln(x) * 1 dx\n\nThe second term on the right-hand side is just ln(x), which is an antiderivative of ln(x). Therefore, we can write:\n\nI(x) = ln(x) * (x + 1) - ln(x) + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration. Since we want to evaluate the integral at a specific point, let's substitute x = 4:\n\nI(4) = ln(4) * (4 + 1) - ln(4) + C\n\nNow, we need to simplify this expression and evaluate the integral at x = 4. To do this, we can use a calculator or software like Wolfram Alpha to find the value of ln(4).\n\nUsing the natural logarithm property that ln(a^b) = b * ln(a), we can rewrite ln(4) as ln(2^2) = 2 * ln(2). Using the change of base formula, we can convert ln(2) to its equivalent in base 10:\n\nln(2) = 0.6931471805599453 (approximately)\n\nSo, ln(4) = 2 * 0.6931471805599453 = 1.3862943611198906 (approximately).\n\nNow, we can substitute these values back into our expression for I(4):\n\nI(4) = 1.3862943611198906 * (4 + 1) - 1.3862943611198906 + C\n\nI(4) = 10.386294361119891 - 1.3862943611198906 + C\n\nI(4) = 8.999999999999999 + C\n\nSince we are looking for an integer result by rounding down, we can ignore the small error term and the constant of integration C. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nI(4) = 9\n\nSo, the integral of ln(x)*(1+x) from 0 to 4, rounded down to the nearest integer, is 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)*(1+x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function ln(x)*(1+x) + x, we will integrate each term separately and then combine the results.
