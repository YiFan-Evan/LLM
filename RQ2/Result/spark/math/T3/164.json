Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product is equal to the original function. Then, you integrate one part and differentiate the other.\n\nFor our case, let's choose f(x) = ln(x) and g(x) = x. The derivative of f(x) * g(x) is:\n\nf'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x) = 1/x * x + x * 1 = x + 1\n\nNow, we need to check if this matches the original function x*ln(x). Substituting x = u and dv = dx gives us:\n\ndv = 1/u * du\ndu = dx\n\nSo, integrating both sides gives:\n\n\u222b (1/u * du) = \u222b dx\n\nThis means that the derivative of the product of f(u) and g(x) is indeed equal to the original function x*ln(x). Therefore, we can proceed with integration by parts.\n\nLet's write out the steps:\n\nI(x) = \u222b x*ln(x) dx\n\nLet's choose u = ln(x) and dv = x dx. Then:\n\ndu = 1/x * dx\ndv = dx\n\nSubstituting these into the integral of the derivative of the product, we get:\n\nI(x) = x * ln(x) - \u222b x/x * dx\n\nThe second term on the right-hand side is just \u222b dx, which is x. So, we have:\n\nI(x) = x * ln(x) - x + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration. Since we want to find the indefinite integral without the constant of integration, we can simply remove the constant C:\n\nI(x) = x * ln(x) - x\n\nNow, let's substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral:\n\nI(4) = 4 * ln(4) - 4\n\nCalculating the value of this expression gives:\n\nI(4) = 4 * ln(4) - 4 = 4 * 1.38629436112 - 4 \u2248 5.53629436112 - 4 \u2248 1.53629436112\n\nFinally, rounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\n\nI(4) \u2248 1"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: x*ln(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The function you've provided is a mathematical expression that represents the integral of x*ln(x) with respect to x.
