Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express the integral of a product of two functions as the difference of integrals of the individual functions, with one integrated over a smaller interval.\n\nThe steps for integration by parts are:\n\n1. Choose a function u(x) that is differentiable and does not have a term involving x in its derivative.\n2. Choose a function v(x) that is also differentiable and has a term involving x in its derivative.\n3. Use the formula: \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nFor our function e^(1+x), let's choose u(x) = e^(1+x) and v(x) = x. Then,\n\ndu/dx = u'(x) = e^(1+x)\ndv/dx = v'(x) = 1\n\nNow, substitute these into the integration by parts formula:\n\nI(x) = \u222be^(1+x) dx - \u222bx*e^(1+x) dx\n     = e^(1+x) - \u222bx*e^(1+x) dx\n\nNow, let's integrate the second part:\n\n\u222bx*e^(1+x) dx = x*e^(1+x) - \u222be^(1+x) dx\n               = x*e^(1+x) - (e^(1+x) + C)\n\nSubstituting this back into the first equation gives us:\n\nI(x) = e^(1+x) - (e^(1+x) + C) + C\n     = e^(1+x) - e^(1+x) + C\n     = C\n\nSince the constant of integration C can be any real number, the result of the indefinite integral of e^(1+x) is C. To evaluate the integral at x=4, we would need to know the value of C. However, without specifying C, we cannot determine the exact value of the integral at x=4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^(1+x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function e^(1+x)+x, we can use integration by parts again.
