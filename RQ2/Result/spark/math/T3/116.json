Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions. The basic idea is to express the integral as the difference of two simpler integrals, and then solve for one of them using the original function.\n\nLet's choose u = cos(x) and dv = dx. Then:\n\ndu/dx = -sin(x)\ndv/dx = 1\n\nSubstituting these into the product rule for differentiation, we get:\n\nI(x) = \u222b (1 + cos(x)) dx = \u222b (udv + vdu) dx\n\nNow, let's integrate each term separately:\n\n\u222b udv dx = uv - \u222b v du\n\u222b vdu dx = uv - \u222b v du\n\nSince u = cos(x) and dv = dx, we have:\n\nuv = cos^2(x) * dx\n\nSo, the first integral becomes:\n\n\u222b cos^2(x) dx = (1/3) sin(x) + C\n\nFor the second integral, we need to find the derivative of the function v = x. Since v = x, its derivative is simply 1. Therefore, the second integral is:\n\n\u222b v du = x*sin(x) + C\n\nNow, we can substitute the results back into the original expression:\n\nI(x) = (1/3) sin(x) + x*sin(x) + C\n\nHowever, since we want to find the indefinite integral without the constant of integration, we will ignore the constant C. So, the indefinite integral of (1+cos(x)) is:\n\nI(x) = (1/3) sin(x) + x*sin(x)\n\nNow, if you want to substitute 'x=4' into this result, you would calculate:\n\nI(4) = (1/3) sin(4) + 4*sin(4)\n\nFinally, to round down to an integer, you would take the floor of the result. However, since the result of this calculation involves trigonometric functions, it's not straightforward to determine the exact value without using a calculator or software."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+cos(x))+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function (1 + cos(x)) + x, we can integrate each term separately.
