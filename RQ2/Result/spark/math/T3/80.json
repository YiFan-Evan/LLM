Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product equals the original function. Then, you integrate one part and differentiate the other.\n\nFor our function (1/x^2), we can choose f(x) = 1 and g(x) = x^-2.
