The hyperbolic sine function $\\sinh(x)$ has an integral involving the hyperbolic tangent function $\\tanh(x)$:\n$$ \\int \\frac{1}{\\sinh(x)} \\, dx = \\log(\\tanh(\\frac{x}{2})) + C_1 $$\n\n#### Part 2: $\\int \\frac{x}{\\sinh(x)} \\, dx$\nThis is a more complex integral. We can use integration by parts where $u = x$ and $dv = \\frac{1}{\\sinh(x)}dx$. Thus, $du = dx$ and $v = \\log(\\tanh(\\frac{x}{2}))$.
