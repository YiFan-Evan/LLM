Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express one part of the integrand as a derivative and the other part as an antiderivative, then integrate them separately.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = 1/x.

The indefinite integral of e^x*(1/x) is:\n$$ \\int e^x \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx = e^x \\ln|x| - \\int e^x \\frac{1}{x^2} \\, dx $$\nThis integral does not have a simple form in terms of elementary functions and involves an infinite series or special functions (Exponential Integral).
