Evaluate ln(x): This is the natural logarithm of x, which measures the power to which the base e (approximately equal to 2.71828) must be raised to produce x.\n\n2. Add x to the result of step 1: This gives you the value of f(x).\n\nFor example, if you want to calculate f(2), you would do the following:\n\nf(2) = ln(2) + 2\n     = 0.693147 + 2\n     = 2.693147\n\nSo, f(2) approximately equals 2.693147."}]
