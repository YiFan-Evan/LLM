Let's denote the function as f(x) = e^(x^2).\n\nThe first step is to find a suitable function u(x) and v'(x) such that u'(x) = v(x) and v'(x) = f(x). \n\nA common choice for u(x) is x, which gives us u'(x) = 1. For v(x), we can choose e^(-x^2), which satisfies v'(x) = -2xe^(-x^2).\n\nNow, let's integrate both sides of the equation:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = \u222b u(x) dv(x)\n\n= [uv] - \u222b v(x) du(x)\n\n= [xe^(-x^2)] - \u222b e^(-x^2) dx\n\n= xe^(-x^2) + \u222b e^(-x^2) dx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the second integral. We can use the fact that \u222b e^(-x^2) dx is a standard integral that can be expressed in terms of the error function, erf(x). The indefinite integral of e^(-x^2) is (1/2) * erf(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstituting this into our expression, we get:\n\nxe^(-x^2) + (1/2) * erf(x) + C\n\nSince we want to find the indefinite integral without the constant of integration, we can ignore the C term. Therefore, the indefinite integral of e^(x^2) is:\n\nxe^(-x^2) + (1/2) * erf(x)\n\nNow, if you want to substitute 'x=4' into this result, you would calculate:\n\ne^(4^2) * 4 + (1/2) * erf(4)\n\nHowever, since I cannot perform calculations here, I suggest using a calculator or software like Mathematica or Wolfram Alpha to compute the exact value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x^2+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function e^(x^2) + x, we can use integration by parts again.
