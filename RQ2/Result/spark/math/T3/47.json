Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler integrals that can be evaluated more easily. The basic idea is to choose a function u(x) and a function v(x) such that the derivative of u(x) is v(x) and the derivative of v(x) is u(x). Then, we can write:\n\nI(x) = \u222bu(x) * dv(x) + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nFor our function e^x*ln(x), let's choose u(x) = x and v(x) = e^x. Then:\n\ndu/dx = 1, dv/dx = e^x\n\nSubstituting these into the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\nI(x) = x * e^x - \u222be^x * dx + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral on the right side:\n\n\u222be^x * dx = e^x\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of e^x*ln(x) is:\n\nI(x) = x * e^x - e^x + C\n\nNow, if you want to substitute 'x=4' into this expression, you would get:\n\nI(4) = 4 * e^4 - e^4 + C\n\nFinally, to round down the result to the nearest integer, you would take the floor of the above expression.
