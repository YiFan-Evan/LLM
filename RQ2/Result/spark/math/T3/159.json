However, we can still write it as:\n\n\u222b sinh(sin(x)) dx = f(x) + C_1\n\nwhere f(x) represents the antiderivative of sinh(sin(x)) with respect to x, and C_1 is an integration constant.\n\nFor the second part, the integral of x with respect to x is straightforward:\n\n\u222b x dx = (1/2)x^2 + C_2\n\nwhere C_2 is another integration constant.\n\nCombining both parts, we get:\n\n\u222b (sinh(sin(x)) + x) dx = f(x) + (1/2)x^2 + C\n\nwhere C = C_1 + C_2 is the combined integration constant.\n\nNow, to find the value of this expression when x = 4, we substitute x = 4 into the antiderivative:\n\nf(4) + (1/2)(4)^2 + C\n\nSince we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we need to evaluate f(4) for the antiderivative of sinh(sin(x)) at x = 4. This evaluation will likely require numerical methods or software to approximate the value of f(4), as it does not have an elementary form.\n\nAssuming we have the numerical value of f(4), we can then add (1/2)(4)^2 to it and add the constant C, which will not affect the integer part of the result since we are rounding down.\n\nLet's denote the numerical value of f(4) as N (where N is the approximate value of the antiderivative of sinh(sin(x)) evaluated at x = 4). Then our expression becomes:\n\nN + (1/2)(4)^2 + C\n\nSimplifying further:\n\nN + 8 + C\n\nSince we are rounding down to get the integer result, we can ignore the constant C and any fractional part of N. Therefore, the final integer result is:\n\nRound Down(N + 8)\n\nWithout the actual numerical value of f(4), we cannot provide a specific integer answer. If you have access to a calculator or software that can evaluate hyperbolic functions and their integrals, you can use it to find the value of f(4) and then apply the rounding down operation to get the final integer result."}]
