Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express one part of the integrand as a derivative and the other part as an antiderivative, then integrate them separately.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = 1/ln(x). Then du/dx = e^x and v = ln(x).\n\nNow, we need to find the integral of u*dv and the integral of v*du.\n\nThe integral of u*dv is u*v - int(v*du) = e^x * ln(x) - int(ln(x) * e^x)\n\nThe integral of v*du is uv - int(u*dv) = ln(x) * e^x - int(e^x * ln(x))\n\nSince both sides are equal, we have:\n\ne^x * ln(x) - int(ln(x) * e^x) = ln(x) * e^x - int(e^x * ln(x))\n\nThis equation holds true for all x > 0 because both sides are well-defined. However, we cannot solve this equation directly because it involves the same function on both sides. We need to simplify it further.\n\nLet's try to simplify the right side:\n\nint(e^x * ln(x)) = e^x * ln(x) - int(e^x * 1/x)\n\nNow, let's integrate the last term:\n\nint(e^x * 1/x) = x * e^x - int(e^x)\n\nWe know that int(e^x) = e^x, so:\n\nint(e^x * 1/x) = x * e^x - e^x\n\nSubstituting this back into the original equation:\n\ne^x * ln(x) - int(ln(x) * e^x) = ln(x) * e^x - (x * e^x - e^x)\n\nNow, we can simplify the equation:\n\ne^x * ln(x) - int(ln(x) * e^x) = ln(x) * e^x - x * e^x + e^x\n\nNow, let's compare both sides:\n\ne^x * ln(x) = ln(x) * e^x + x * e^x - e^x\n\nSolving for the integral of e^x/ln(x):\n\nI(x) = ln(x) * e^x + x * e^x - e^x + C\n\nNow, substituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral:\n\nI(4) = ln(4) * e^4 + 4 * e^4 - e^4 + C\n\nFinally, rounding down the result to the nearest integer:\n\nI(4) = 28\n\nSo, the integer result of the expression after rounding down is 28."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x/ln(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function $ f(x) = \\frac{e^x}{\\ln(x)} + x $, we need to integrate each term separately.\n\n### Step 1: Integrate $\\frac{e^x}{\\ln(x)}$\nThis part is more complex and does not have a standard elementary form.
