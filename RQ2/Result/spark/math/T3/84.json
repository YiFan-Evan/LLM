Let's denote the indefinite integral as \\( I(x) \\).\n\nIntegration by parts involves choosing a function \\( u(x) \\) and a function \\( v(x) \\) such that \\( u'(x) \\) is easy to integrate and \\( v'(x) \\) is equal to the original function. Then, we can write:\n\n\\[ I(x) = \\int \\frac{x}{1+x} dx = \\int u(x) \\cdot v'(x) dx \\]\n\nLet's choose \\( u(x) = x \\) and \\( v(x) = \\ln(1+x) \\). Then:\n\n\\[ u'(x) = 1 \\]\n\\[ v'(x) = \\frac{1}{1+x} \\]\n\nSubstituting these into the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\n\\[ I(x) = \\int x \\cdot \\frac{1}{1+x} dx = x \\cdot \\ln(1+x) - \\int \\ln(1+x) dx \\]\n\nNow, let's evaluate the last integral:\n\n\\[ \\int \\ln(1+x) dx = \\ln(1+x) + C \\]\n\nWhere \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstituting this back into our expression for \\( I(x) \\):\n\n\\[ I(x) = x \\cdot \\ln(1+x) - (\\ln(1+x) + C) + C \\]\n\nSince we want to find the indefinite integral without the constant of integration, we can simplify this to:\n\n\\[ I(x) = x \\cdot \\ln(1+x) - \\ln(1+x) \\]\n\nNow, if you want to substitute \\( x=4 \\) into this result, you would do so as follows:\n\n\\[ I(4) = 4 \\cdot \\ln(5) - \\ln(5) \\]\n\nTo find the integer result by rounding down, we can calculate the value of the expression and then round it down to the nearest integer. In Python, you could do this with the following code:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\n# Calculate the value of the indefinite integral at x=4\nresult = 4 * math.log(5) - math.log(5)\n\n# Round down to the nearest integer\ninteger_result = math.floor(result)\n\nprint(integer_result)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the integer result of the expression after substituting \\( x=4 \\) into the indefinite integral of \\( \\frac{x}{1+x} \\)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: x/(1+x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The function you've provided is a simple algebraic expression. To find the value of this function for a given x, we can simply plug in the value of x into the expression and evaluate it.\n\nHere's how you can do it in Python:\n\n```python\ndef evaluate_function(x):\n    return x / (1 + x) + x\n\n# Example usage:\nx_value = 2\nresult = evaluate_function(x_value)\nprint(\"The result of the function for x =\", x_value, \"is\", result)\n```\n\nYou can replace `x_value` with any number you want to evaluate the function at.
