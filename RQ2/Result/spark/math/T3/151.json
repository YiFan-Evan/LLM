To find the indefinite integral of this function, we can use integration by parts or other methods. However, since the function is already in its simplest form, the integral of (1+(1+x)) with respect to x is simply (x+2) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nTo substitute x=4 into the result and get an integer value, we would do:\n\n(4+2) + C = 6 + C\n\nSince C is a constant, it doesn't affect the integer value when added to 6.
