Therefore, we have:\n\n\u222b(1 + 2x) dx = x + \u222b2x dx = x + 2\u222bx dx = x + 2 * (x^2/2)\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n\u222b(1 + 2x) dx = x + x^2\n\nNow, we substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\n\nx + x^2 |_{x=4} = 4 + 4^2 = 4 + 16 = 20\n\nFinally, we round down the result to get the integer part:\n\n\u230a20\u230b = 20\n\nSo the final answer is 20."}]
