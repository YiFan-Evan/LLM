Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an indefinite integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product equals the original function. Then, you integrate one part and differentiate the other.\n\nFor our function (1 + ln(x)), let's choose:\nf(x) = x\ng(x) = 1 + ln(x)\n\nThe derivative of f(x) * g(x) is:\ndf/dx * g(x) + f(x) * dg/dx = 1 + ln(x) + 1 = 2 + ln(x)\n\nNow, we need to find the derivatives of f(x) and g(x):\ndf/dx = 1\ndg/dx = 1/x\n\nSubstituting these derivatives into the equation for the derivative of f(x) * g(x), we get:\n1 * (1 + ln(x)) + x * (0) = 2 + ln(x)\n\nThis equation holds true for all x > 0, so we can write the integral as:\nI(x) = x * (1 + ln(x)) - ln(x) + C\n\nWhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, if we want to substitute x = 4 into this expression, we get:\nI(4) = 4 * (1 + ln(4)) - ln(4) + C\n\nLet's calculate the value of I(4):\nI(4) = 4 * (1 + ln(4)) - ln(4) + C\nI(4) = 4 * (1 + 1.3863) - 0.6021 + C\nI(4) = 4 * 2.3863 + C\nI(4) = 9.5452 + C\n\nSince the question asks for the integer result of the expression by rounding down, we will ignore the constant of integration C and round down the result:\nI(4) = 9\n\nSo, the integer result of the expression after substituting x=4 and rounding down is 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+ln(x))+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function (1 + ln(x)) + x, we can integrate each term separately.

For the natural logarithm term ln(x), the integral is x * ln(x) - x (using integration by parts).\n3.
