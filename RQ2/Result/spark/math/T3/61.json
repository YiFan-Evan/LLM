Therefore, the function becomes:\n\nf(x) = 1 + x\n\nNow, we need to find the indefinite integral of this function. The indefinite integral of a constant is simply the constant times x, and the indefinite integral of x is x^2/2. So, the indefinite integral of f(x) is:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = \u222b (1 + x) dx = x + (x^2)/2 + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\n\n\u222b f(4) dx = 4 + (4^2)/2 + C = 4 + 8 + C = 12 + C\n\nSince we are asked for the integer result by rounding down, we ignore the constant C and round down the result to get the final answer:\n\nFinal answer: 12"}]
