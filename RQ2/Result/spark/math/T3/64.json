Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express one part of the integral as the derivative of another part, and then integrate that derivative.\n\nLet's start with the function f(x) = 1/e^x and g(x) = e^x. We want to find a function F(x) such that:\n\nI(x) = F(x) - F(a)\n\nwhere a is the lower limit of integration and x is the upper limit. Since we are finding an indefinite integral, we assume that a = 0.\n\nNow, let's apply integration by parts:\n\nI(x) = [f(x)g(x)] - [f(a)g(a)] + C\n\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nWe know that:\n\nf(x) = 1/e^x\ng(x) = e^x\n\nSo, our integral becomes:\n\nI(x) = [1/e^x * e^x] - [1/e^0 * e^0] + C\n     = [1/e^x * e^x] - [1] + C\n     = [1/e^x * e^x - 1] + C\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral from 0 to x, which gives us:\n\nI(x) = [1/e^x * e^x - 1] - [1/e^0 * e^0 - 1] + C\n     = [1/e^x * e^x - 1] - [1 - 1] + C\n     = [1/e^x * e^x - 1] + C\n\nSince we are looking for the result at x, we can simplify this expression:\n\nI(x) = 1/e^x - 1 + C\n\nNow, we can choose any value for C that makes the expression valid. However, since we are interested in the result at x=4, we can ignore the constant of integration C and just calculate the expression for x=4:\n\nI(4) = 1/e^4 - 1\n\nNow, let's calculate the actual numerical value:\n\nI(4) \u2248 0.0539 - 1\n     \u2248 -0.9461\n\nSince we are asked to round down to the nearest integer, the result is -1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/e^x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{e^x} + x \\), we can integrate each term separately.
