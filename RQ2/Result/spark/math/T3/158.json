[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The basic idea is to express one part of the integral as the derivative of another part, and then integrate that derivative.\n\nLet's start with the integral of sin(u):\n\nI(u) = -cos(u) + C, where u = e^x.\n\nNow, let's differentiate both sides of this equation:\n\ndI/du = cos(u) * du/dx.\n\nSubstituting u = e^x, we get:\n\ndI/dx = cos(e^x) * e^x dx.\n\nIntegrating both sides from a to b (where a and b are the limits of integration):\n\nI(b) - I(a) = [-sin(e^x)] * e^x |_a^b + C.\n\nSince we want to find the indefinite integral, we can ignore the constant of integration C and the limits of integration (since they are not specified in the problem). So, the indefinite integral of sin(e^x) is:\n\nI(x) = -sin(e^x) * e^x + C.\n\nNow, if you want to substitute x = 4 into this expression, you would replace all instances of x with 4:\n\nI(4) = -sin(e^4) * e^4 + C.\n\nFinally, if you want to round down the result to the nearest integer, you would do so after evaluating the expression at x = 4. However, since the result includes an exponential function and a trigonometric function, it will likely be a floating-point number rather than an integer.
