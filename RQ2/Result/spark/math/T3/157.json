Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions. The basic idea is to express the integral as the difference of two simpler integrals, and then evaluate each of these separately.\n\nLet's choose u = x and dv = 1/x. Then du/dx = dx/dx = 1, and v = ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral:\n\nI(x) = \u222b (1+x)/x dx\n     = \u222b (1/x) du + \u222b (1/x) d(ln|x| + C)\n     = ln|x| - ln|x| + C + C\n     = 2C\n\nSince there is no specific constant of integration given, we can choose either C = 0 or C = 1 without affecting the result. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1+x)/x is 2C, which can be written as 2C for simplicity.\n\nNow, let's substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral:\n\nI(4) = 2C\n\nSince C is a constant, it does not affect the value when substituting x = 4. Therefore, I(4) = 2C.\n\nFinally, since the question asks for an integer result by rounding down, we need to determine the integer value of C. Since C can be any real number, we cannot provide a specific integer value for C. However, if you want to round down the result to the nearest integer, you would get:\n\nI(4) rounded down = floor(2C)\n\nSince C can be any real number, the result will also be a real number.
