Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute an integral by breaking it down into simpler parts. The process involves choosing two functions, f(x) and g(x), such that the derivative of their product is equal to the original function. Then, you integrate one part and differentiate the other.\n\nFor our case, let's choose f(x) = x and g(x) = sinh(x). Their derivatives are:\n\nf'(x) = 1\ng'(x) = cosh(x)\n\nThe derivative of f(x) * g(x) is then:\n\nf'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x) = x * cosh(x) + x * sinh(x)\n\nNow, let's set this equal to the original function:\n\nx * sinh(x) = x * cosh(x) + x * sinh(x)\n\nThis equation holds true for all x, so we can write the indefinite integral as:\n\nI(x) = x * cosh(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, if we want to substitute x=4 into the result, we get:\n\nI(4) = 4 * cosh(4) + C\n\nFinally, to round down the result to the nearest integer, we would need to evaluate the expression at x=4 and then round down the resulting number. However, since I(x) includes a non-integer constant C, we cannot directly round down the result without specifying a value for C. If you provide a specific value for C, I can calculate the exact integer result for I(4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: x*sinh(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function \\(x \\sinh(x) + x\\), we can use integration by parts.
