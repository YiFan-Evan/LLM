It measures the power to which a constant must be raised to produce a given number x.\n\nThe natural logarithm is defined for all positive numbers x, except for zero and negative numbers. For any positive number x, ln(x) can be calculated using the following formula:\n\nln(x) = \u222b[1, x] (1/t) dt from t=1 to t=x\n\nThis integral represents the area under the curve of the function y = 1/x between x=1 and x. The antiderivative of the function 1/x is x, so the integral from 1 to x of 1/t dt is x - 1. Therefore,\n\nln(x) = x - 1\n\nFor x > 0, this gives us the value of ln(x).

It can be evaluated for any positive number x, but not for zero or negative numbers.\n\nThe natural logarithm ln(x) is defined as the logarithm to the base e (approximately equal to 2.71828) of x. The natural logarithm is an increasing function on its domain, which includes all positive real numbers except zero.\n\nThe identity function x is simply the input value itself.\n\nWhen you add these two functions together, you get:\n\nln(x) + x = ln(x) + ln(e^x)\n\nSince ln(e^x) = x, this simplifies to:\n\nln(x) + x = ln(x) + x\n\nSo, the function ln(x) + x is equivalent to the natural logarithm of x plus x.\n\nTo evaluate this function at a specific point, you would need to know the value of x. For example, if x = 2, then:\n\nln(2) + 2 = 0.693147 + 2 \u2248 2.693147\n\nHowever, keep in mind that the natural logarithm is undefined for x = 0, and it is also undefined for negative values of x."}]
