Therefore, the original problem as stated cannot be solved using real numbers for the first part involving $ \\ln(\\cos(x)) \\cdot e^x $.\n\nHowever, for the second part $ \\frac{x^2}{2} $:\n$$ \\frac{4^2}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 $$\n\n### Conclusion\nThe function $ \\ln(\\cos(x)) \\cdot e^x + x $ and its integral are not defined for $ x = 4 $ in the real number system because $ \\cos(4) $ is negative, making $ \\ln(\\cos(4)) $ undefined.
