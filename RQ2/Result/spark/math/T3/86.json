Let's denote the indefinite integral as I(x).\n\nIntegration by parts is a method to compute integrals that involve products of functions, where one function is relatively easy to integrate and the other is relatively easy to differentiate. The basic idea is to express the original integral as the difference of two simpler integrals, each of which can be computed more easily.\n\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = 1/cos(x) dx. Then:\n\ndu/dx = e^x dx\ndv/dx = -sec(x)^2 dx\n\nNow, let's substitute these into the integral:\n\nI(x) = \u222b e^x / cos(x) dx\n     = \u222b (e^x * -sec(x)^2) dx\n     = -\u222b e^x * sec(x) dx\n     = -[e^x * ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|] + C\n\nSince we want to evaluate the integral at x = 4, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result:\n\nI(4) = -[e^4 * ln|sec(4) + tan(4)|] + C\n\nNow, let's calculate the value of this expression:\n\nFirst, note that sec(x) = 1/cos(x), so sec(4) = 1/cos(4).\n\nSecond, tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x), so tan(4) = sin(4)/cos(4).\n\nWe can now plug these values into the expression for I(4):\n\nI(4) = -[e^4 * ln|1/cos(4) + sin(4)/cos(4)|] + C\n\nHowever, since we are asked to round down to an integer, we will not include the constant of integration C in our final answer. We can simplify the expression further by using trigonometric identity:\n\nsin(4) = 2*sin(2)*cos(2)\ncos(4) = cos^2(2) - sin^2(2)\n\nSubstituting these values into the expression for I(4):\n\nI(4) = -[e^4 * ln|1/(cos^2(2) - sin^2(2)) + 2*sin(2)*cos(2)/(cos^2(2) - sin^2(2))|]\n\nNow, let's calculate the actual numerical values:\n\nsin(2) = \u221a2/2, cos(2) = \u221a2/2, cos^2(2) = (\u221a2/2)^2 = 1/2, sin^2(2) = (\u221a2/2)^2 = 1/2\n\nSo, cos^2(2) - sin^2(2) = 1/2 - 1/2 = 0, and sin(2)*cos(2) = \u221a2/2 * \u221a2/2 = 1/2.\n\nPlugging these values into the expression for I(4):\n\nI(4) = -[e^4 * ln|1/0 + 2/0|]\n     = -[e^4 * ln|-\u221e|]\n     = -\u221e\n\nSince the integral diverges at x = 4, it does not converge to a finite value, and thus there is no integer result when rounded down."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x/cos(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function $ f(x) = \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} + x $, we need to integrate each term separately and then combine the results.\n\n### Step 1: Integrate $\\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)}$\nThis part of the integral is more complex and was discussed in the previous response.
