[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `m` should start at 0, not -1, to correctly iterate through the array. Additionally, the condition `m < len(arr) - 1` should be `m < len(arr)`, since we want to include the last element of the array in our iteration.\n\nHere is the corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr):\n        if m == id:\n            member_value = arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return member_value\n```\n\nThis function will return the value at index `id` in the array `arr` if `id` is within the bounds of the array; otherwise, it will return -1."}]
