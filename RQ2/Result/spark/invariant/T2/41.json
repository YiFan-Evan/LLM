The function uses a while loop to iterate through each element of the array, checking if it is equal to the target value. If it is, the count is incremented.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    b = 0  # Start from index 0 instead of -1\n    while b < len(arr):  # No need to subtract 1 as we start from 0\n        if arr[b] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        b += 1  # Increment b at the end of the loop\n    return count_value\n```\n\nThis corrected function initializes `b` to 0 (instead of -1) and removes the unnecessary subtraction inside the while loop condition. It then correctly counts the occurrences of `target` in `arr`."}]
