The algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how your code works:\n\n1. Initialize `t` to -1, which will be used as an index for the last sorted element.\n2. Use a while loop to iterate over each element in the array until the last sorted element reaches the end of the array.\n3. Within the outer loop, increment `t` to move the boundary of the sorted portion of the array one step to the right.\n4. Initialize `z` to `t + 1`, which will be used to find the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array.\n5. Use another while loop to compare elements starting from `arr[t+1]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]`.\n6. If an element smaller than `arr[t]` is found, swap it with `arr[t]`.\n7. Increment `z` to continue checking the rest of the unsorted portion.\n8. Once all elements have been checked and potentially swapped, return the sorted array.\n\nThe provided code correctly implements the selection sort algorithm and should work as expected for sorting an array of comparable elements in ascending order."}]
