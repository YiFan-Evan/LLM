The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The variable `c` should start at 0, not -1, to correctly iterate through the array `arr`. Here's the corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    c = 0\n    while c < len(arr):\n        if c == id:\n            member_value = arr[c]\n        c += 1\n    return member_value\n```\n\nThis function will return the value at index `id` in the array `arr` if `id` is within the bounds of the array; otherwise, it will return -1."}]
