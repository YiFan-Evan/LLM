The function `insertion_sort` is supposed to sort an array using the insertion sort algorithm. Below is a corrected version of the function in Python:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version of the function works as follows:\n\n- It iterates over each element in the array starting from the second element (index 1).\n- For each element, it compares it with the elements before it.\n- If the current element is smaller than the previous element, it shifts the previous element to the right until it finds the correct position for the current element.\n- Once the correct position is found, it inserts the current element there.\n- This process continues until all elements are sorted.\n\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n```python\nunsorted_array = [34, 2, 10, -9]\nsorted_array = insertion_sort(unsorted_array)\nprint(sorted_array)  # Output will be [-9, 2, 10, 34]\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = -1\n    while l < len(arr) - 1:\n        l += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```\n    l = -1\n    while l < len(arr) - 1:\n        l += 1\n        z = l\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr```"}]
