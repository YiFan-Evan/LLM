The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `d` should start at 0, not -1, and the loop condition should be `d < len(arr)`, not `d < len(arr) - 1`. Here's the corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    d = 0\n    while d < len(arr):\n        if d == id:\n            member_value = arr[d]\n        d += 1\n    return member_value\n```\n\nThis function will return the value at index `id` in the array `arr` if `id` is within the bounds of the array; otherwise, it will return -1."}]
