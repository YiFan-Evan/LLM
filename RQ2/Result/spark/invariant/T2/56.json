It uses a while loop to iterate through each element of the array and checks if the current element matches the target value. If it does, it increments the `count_value` variable by one.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your function with proper indentation and comments:\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function takes an array 'arr' and a target value 'target',\n    and returns the count of how many times 'target' appears in 'arr'.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Initialize the count of occurrences of the target value\n    count_value = 0\n    \n    # Start from the first index (q = -1 + 1)\n    q = -1\n    \n    # Continue until we reach the end of the array\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:\n        # Move to the next index\n        q += 1\n        \n        # Check if the current element matches the target value\n        if arr[q] == target:\n            # Increment the count of occurrences\n            count_value += 1\n    \n    # Return the total count of occurrences\n    return count_value\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\nmy_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2]\ntarget_value = 2\nprint(give_count(my_array, target_value))  # Output will be 3, as 2 appears three times in my_array\n```"}]
