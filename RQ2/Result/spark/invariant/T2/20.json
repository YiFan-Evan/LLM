However, there's a more Pythonic way to write this function using a for loop instead of a while loop. Here's how you could rewrite it:\n\n```python\ndef find_min(arr):\n    # Initialize min_value with the first element of the array\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    \n    # Iterate over the array starting from the second element\n    for num in arr[1:]:\n        # Update min_value if a smaller number is found\n        if num < min_value:\n            min_value = num\n    \n    return min_value\n```\n\nThis version of the function does essentially the same thing as your original code but is more concise and easier to read. The initialization of `min_value` is done outside the loop, and then the loop starts from the second element (index 1) because we already have the first element stored in `min_value`."}]
