The variable `i` is not defined within the function, and the loop structure is incorrect. Below is a corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm in Python:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version initializes `i` to start from the second element (index 1) since the first element (index 0) is considered sorted by default. It then uses a `key` variable to hold the value of the current element being compared. The inner loop shifts elements of `arr` that are greater than `key` to one position ahead of their current position, starting from the element just before `key`. Once the correct position for `key` is found, it is placed there."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        j += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```\n    return arr```"}]
