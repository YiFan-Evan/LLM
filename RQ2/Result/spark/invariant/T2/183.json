The algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the first unsorted element.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how your code works:\n\n1. Initialize `d` to -1, which will be used as an index for the start of the unsorted portion of the array.\n2. Use a while loop to iterate through the array until `d` reaches the second last element (since the last element is already sorted).\n3. Inside the outer loop, increment `d` to move to the next element that needs to be sorted.\n4. Initialize `z` to `d + 1`, which will be used to compare elements with the current `d` element.\n5. Use another while loop to find the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array starting from `d + 1` to the end of the array.\n6. If you find an element smaller than `arr[d]`, swap them using a temporary variable `temp`.\n7. Increment `z` to continue checking the rest of the unsorted portion.\n8. Once the inner loop finishes, `arr[d]` contains the smallest element from the unsorted portion, and it is now in its correct position.\n9. Continue this process until the entire array is sorted.\n\nThe provided code correctly implements the selection sort algorithm and should work as expected for sorting an array of comparable elements in ascending order."}]
