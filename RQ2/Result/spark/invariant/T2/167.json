[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The corrected version of the function should look like this:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version of `insertion_sort` will correctly sort the input list `arr` using the insertion sort algorithm. Here's a brief explanation of how the corrected code works:\n\n- The outer loop (`for i in range(1, len(arr))`) iterates over each element in the array starting from the second element (index 1).\n- The inner loop (`while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]`) shifts elements of `arr[0..i-1]`, that are greater than key, to one position ahead of their current position.\n- After the inner loop finishes, the `key` is placed in its correct position in the sorted part of the array.\n\nHere's an example usage of the corrected `insertion_sort` function:\n\n```python\nunsorted_list = [34, 2, 10, -9]\nsorted_list = insertion_sort(unsorted_list)\nprint(sorted_list)  # Output: [-9, 2, 10, 34]\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        z = h\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr```"}]
