The variable `i` is not defined within the loop, and it should be replaced with `q` to correctly track the index of the current element being checked. Here's the corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    q = 0\n    while q < len(arr):\n        if arr[q] == target:\n            id_value = q  # Use 'q' instead of 'i'\n            break  # Optionally break out of the loop once the target is found\n        q += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\nThis function will return the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the list `arr`, or `-1` if `target` is not found.
