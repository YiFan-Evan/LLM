The function returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if it exists; otherwise, it returns -1.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It initializes `id_value` to -1, which will be returned if the target is not found in the array.\n2. It sets up a while loop that runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to the length of `arr` minus 1 (since list indices start at 0).\n3. Inside the loop, it checks if the element at index `i` of `arr` is equal to `target`. If it is, it updates `id_value` to `i`.\n4. After checking each element, it increments `i` by 1 to move to the next element in the list.\n5. Once the loop finishes, it returns `id_value`, which will either be the index of the first occurrence of `target` or -1 if `target` was not found.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\ntarget_value = 30\nindex = give_id(my_list, target_value)\nprint(\"Index of\", target_value, \"is\", index)  # Output: Index of 30 is 2\n```\n\nIf you call `give_id` with a list that does not contain the target value, it will return -1:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\ntarget_value = 60\nindex = give_id(my_list, target_value)\nprint(\"Index of\", target_value, \"is\", index)  # Output: Index of 60 is -1\n```"}]
