However, there's a small issue with the logic: the while loop will always return the last element of the list because it updates `last_value` with each element in the array as it iterates through it.\n\nHere's a corrected version of the function that simply returns the last element without needing to loop through the entire list:\n\n```python\ndef give_last(arr):\n    return arr[-1]\n```\n\nThis function uses negative indexing to directly access the last element of the list. Negative indices count from the end of the list, so `-1` refers to the last element, `-2` to the second last, and so on. This approach is more efficient than looping through the list, especially for large lists."}]
