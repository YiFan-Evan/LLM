However, there is a potential issue with your code: the condition `r <= len(arr) - 1` should be `r < len(arr)`, because list indices start at 0 and go up to `len(arr) - 1`.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    if id >= 0 and id < len(arr):\n        return arr[id]\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis function will return the value at the specified index `id` if it is within the bounds of the list `arr`. If the index is out of range, it will return `-1`."}]
