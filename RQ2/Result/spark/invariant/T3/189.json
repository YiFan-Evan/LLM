The `selection_sort` function is supposed to sort an array in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm, but there are several mistakes:\n\n1. The variable `i` is not defined anywhere in the function. It seems like it should be initialized to 0 at the beginning of the outer loop.\n2. The inner loop should start from `j - 1` instead of `i`, because we want to compare each element with all elements before it.\n3. The condition in the inner loop should be `arr[z] > arr[j]` instead of `arr[z] < arr[j]` to find the maximum element and swap it with the current element.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the `selection_sort` function:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        max_idx = i\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if arr[j] > arr[max_idx]:\n                max_idx = j\n        arr[i], arr[max_idx] = arr[max_idx], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version will correctly sort the array in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm."}]
