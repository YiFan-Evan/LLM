The function `give_sum` you provided calculates the sum of all elements in a list `arr` by iterating through the list from the end to the beginning. Here's how the function works:\n\n1. It initializes a variable `sum_value` to 0, which will hold the cumulative sum of the elements.\n2. It determines the length of the array `arr` and assigns it to the variable `l`.\n3. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `l` is greater than 0.\n4. Inside the loop, it decrements `l` by 1 to move towards the start of the array.\n5. It adds the value of `arr[l]` to `sum_value`.\n6. Once the loop finishes (when `l` becomes 0), it returns the total sum stored in `sum_value`.\n\nHere's the code block in markdown format:\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    l = len(arr)\n    while l > 0:\n        l -= 1\n        sum_value += arr[l]\n    return sum_value\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\nmy_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = give_sum(my_array)\nprint(\"The sum of the array is:\", result)  # Output will be 15\n```"}]
