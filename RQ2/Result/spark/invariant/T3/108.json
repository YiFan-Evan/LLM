The issue with your code is that it will always return -1 because the condition `i == id` will never be true if `id` is greater than or equal to the length of the array `arr`.\n\nHere's a corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    if id < len(arr) and id >= 0:\n        return arr[id]\n    else:\n        return None  # Return None or raise an exception if the index is out of bounds\n```\n\nThis function first checks if the given `id` is within the valid range of indices for the list `arr`. If it is, it returns the value at that index. Otherwise, it returns `None` (or you could choose to raise an exception).\n\nRemember that Python lists are zero-indexed, so the first element is at index 0, the second element is at index 1, and so on. If `id` is negative or greater than or equal to the length of the list, it's out of bounds and should not be accessed."}]
