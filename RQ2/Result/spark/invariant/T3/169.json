The variable `i` is not defined within the function, and the loop structure is incorrect. Here's a corrected version of the insertion sort function:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version initializes `i` to 1 (since the first element is already considered sorted), then iterates through the array from the second element to the last. For each element, it compares it with the elements before it and shifts those elements that are greater to the right until it finds the correct position for the current element."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = len(arr)\n    while j > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        j -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i-1\n        while j >=0 and key < arr[j] :\n                arr[j+1] = arr[j]\n                j -= 1\n        arr[j+1] = key\n    return arr```"}]
