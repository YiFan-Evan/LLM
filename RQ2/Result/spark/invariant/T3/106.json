However, there are a few issues with your code:\n\n1. The `g` variable is initialized to the length of the array, which is one more than the last valid index (since Python lists are zero-indexed). This will cause an `IndexError` when you try to access `arr[g]`.\n2. The condition `if g == id:` will never be true because `g` starts at `len(arr)` and decreases by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0, while `id` is presumably a non-negative integer less than `len(arr)`.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    if id < len(arr):\n        return arr[id]\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis function will return the value at the specified index `id` if it exists in the list `arr`, otherwise it will return `-1`."}]
