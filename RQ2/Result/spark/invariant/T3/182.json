The `selection_sort` function is supposed to sort an array in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm, but there are several mistakes:\n\n1. The variable `i` is not defined anywhere in the function. It should be initialized to 0 before the inner loop starts.\n2. The inner loop should iterate from `c-1` down to 0, not from `i` down to 0.\n3. The condition `if arr[z] < arr[c]:` should be `if arr[z] > arr[c]:` to correctly find the maximum element in the unsorted part of the array and swap it with the last element of the unsorted part.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the `selection_sort` function:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n - 1):\n        max_idx = i\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if arr[j] > arr[max_idx]:\n                max_idx = j\n        arr[i], arr[max_idx] = arr[max_idx], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version will correctly sort the input array in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm."}]
