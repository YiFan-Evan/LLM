The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `j` should start from `len(arr) - 1` (the last index of the array) and decrement until it reaches 0 (the first index). Also, the condition `if j == id:` should be `if j == len(arr) - 1 - id:` because Python lists are zero-indexed.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    if id < len(arr):\n        return arr[len(arr) - 1 - id]\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis function will return the element at the given `id` position from the end of the list `arr`, or `-1` if the `id` is out of bounds."}]
