However, the function `give_member` is not correctly implemented because it does not handle negative indices or out-of-bounds indices properly.\n\nHere's a corrected version of the function that will return the value at the specified index if it exists, otherwise it will return -1:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    try:\n        return arr[id]\n    except IndexError:\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis version uses Python's built-in exception handling to catch any `IndexError` that might occur if `id` is out of the bounds of the list `arr`. If such an error occurs, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it returns the value at the specified index.\n\nRemember that in Python, list indices start from 0 and can be negative (for example, `arr[-1]` gives the last element of the list). The above function will work for both positive and negative indices as long as they are within the bounds of the list."}]
