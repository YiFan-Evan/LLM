Here's a corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    # Iterate over each element in the array starting from the second element\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        # Store the current element in a temporary variable\n        key = arr[i]\n        # Initialize j to the index of the previous element\n        j = i - 1\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key, to one position ahead of their current position\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        # Place the key in its correct position\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version of `insertion_sort` will correctly sort the input list `arr` using the insertion sort algorithm. The outer loop iterates through each element in the array starting from the second element (since the first element is considered sorted by default). The inner loop moves elements that are greater than the current element to one position ahead, making room for the current element to be inserted in its correct position."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        n -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```\n    i = 1\n    while i < len(arr):\n        j = i\n        while j > 0 and arr[j - 1] > arr[j]:\n            arr[j], arr[j - 1] = arr[j - 1], arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr```"}]
