However, there's a more efficient way to do this using Python's built-in indexing. The current implementation iterates through the entire list and assigns each element to `last_value`, which means that at the end of the loop, `last_value` will be the last element of the list.\n\nHere's a simpler and more efficient version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef give_last(arr):\n    return arr[-1]\n```\n\nThis function simply returns the last element of the list by using negative indexing, where `-1` refers to the last element, `-2` to the second last, and so on. This avoids the need for a loop and makes the function run in constant time, regardless of the size of the list."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_first(arr):\n    first_value = arr[-1]\n    a = len(arr)\n    while a > 0:\n        a -= 1\n        first_value = arr[a]\n    return first_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```\n    return arr[0]```"}]
