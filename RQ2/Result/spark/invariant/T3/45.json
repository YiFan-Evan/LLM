It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, checking each element against the target value and incrementing a counter if they match.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `arr`, which is the list of elements, and `target`, which is the value we are looking for in the list.\n2. It initializes a variable `count_value` to zero, which will keep track of how many times the target value appears in the list.\n3. It sets `f` to the length of the array, which is the index of the last element in the array (since array indices start at 0).\n4. The while loop runs as long as `f` is greater than 0, decrementing `f` by 1 with each iteration.\n5. Inside the loop, it checks if the element at index `f` in the array is equal to the target value. If it is, it increments `count_value` by 1.\n6. Once the loop finishes, the function returns `count_value`, which represents the total count of occurrences of the target value in the array.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```python\nmy_array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\ntarget_value = 2\nresult = give_count(my_array, target_value)\nprint(result)  # Output will be 3, because the number 2 appears three times in the array.\n```\n\nThis function should work correctly for counting occurrences of a target value in an array. However, it's worth noting that Python provides built-in functions like `list.count()` that can achieve the same result more efficiently:\n\n```python\nmy_array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\ntarget_value = 2\nresult = my_array.count(target_value)\nprint(result)  # Output will also be 3.\n```"}]
