It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning and increments the `count_value` each time it finds an element equal to the `target`.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. It initializes `count_value` to 0, which will keep track of the number of times the target value appears in the array.\n2. It sets `r` to the length of the array, which is the index of the last element in the array.\n3. The while loop runs as long as `r` is greater than 0, decrementing `r` by 1 with each iteration.\n4. Inside the loop, it checks if the element at index `r` of the array is equal to the `target`. If it is, it increments `count_value`.\n5. Once the loop finishes, it returns `count_value`, which now contains the total count of occurrences of the `target` in the array.\n\nHere's the code block for reference:\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    r = len(arr)\n    while r > 0:\n        r -= 1\n        if arr[r] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\nmy_array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\ntarget_value = 2\nprint(give_count(my_array, target_value))  # Output will be 3, because 2 appears three times in my_array.\n```"}]
