However, there are a few issues with the code:\n\n1. The initialization of `max_value` should be done with the first element of the array, not the last one.\n2. The loop condition should be `j >= 0`, not `j > 0`, because array indices start at 0 and go up to `len(arr) - 1`.\n3. The decrement of `j` should happen before the comparison inside the loop.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef find_max(arr):\n    # Check if the array is empty; if so, return None or raise an exception\n    if not arr:\n        return None  # or raise ValueError(\"Array must not be empty\")\n    \n    max_value = arr[0]  # Start with the first element as the max\n    j = len(arr) - 1     # Start from the last index\n    while j >= 0:        # Ensure we don't go out of bounds\n        if arr[j] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[j]\n        j -= 1            # Decrement j after checking the current element\n    return max_value\n```\n\nThis corrected function will correctly find the maximum value in the array. If you want to handle an empty array, you can either return `None` or raise an exception, depending on how you want to handle such cases."}]
