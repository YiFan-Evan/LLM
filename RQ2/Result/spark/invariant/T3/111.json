[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The issue with your code is that it will only return the last element of the array if the given `id` matches the last index (which is `len(arr) - 1`). If the `id` does not match the last index, it will return `-1`, which is not very useful.\n\nHere's a corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    \"\"\"\n    Returns the value at the specified index in the array.\n    If the index is out of bounds, returns -1.\n    \"\"\"\n    if id >= 0 and id < len(arr):\n        return arr[id]\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis function checks if the `id` is within the valid range for the array indices before attempting to access the element. If the `id` is out of bounds, it returns `-1` as a default value."}]
