It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, decrementing the index `q` until it reaches 0. If the element at the current index `q` matches the target value, it increments the `count_value` by 1. Finally, it returns the total count of occurrences of the target value.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your function with proper indentation and comments:\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of times 'target' appears in 'arr'.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    arr (list): The list of elements to search through.\n    target (any): The value to count in the list.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The number of times 'target' appears in 'arr'.\n    \"\"\"\n    count_value = 0  # Initialize the counter for the target value\n    q = len(arr) - 1  # Start from the last index of the array\n    \n    # Iterate backwards through the array\n    while q >= 0:\n        if arr[q] == target:\n            count_value += 1  # Increment the counter if the current element matches the target\n        q -= 1  # Move to the previous element\n    \n    return count_value  # Return the total count of the target value\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\nmy_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2]\ntarget_value = 2\nprint(give_count(my_array, target_value))  # Output will be 3, as 2 appears three times in my_array\n```"}]
