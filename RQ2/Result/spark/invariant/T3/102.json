[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

However, the function `give_member` as written will not work correctly if the index `id` is out of range for the list `arr`. The while loop will continue until `c` becomes negative, which means it will never find the element at index `id` if `id` is greater than or equal to the length of `arr`.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your function that checks if the index is within the bounds of the list:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    if 0 <= id < len(arr):\n        return arr[id]\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis function will return the value at index `id` if it is within the valid range of indices for `arr`, otherwise it will return `-1`."}]
