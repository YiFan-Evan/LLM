The variable `i` is not defined, and it seems like you want to implement the selection sort algorithm, which sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning of the sorted part.\n\nHere's a corrected version of the selection sort function:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Find the minimum element in remaining unsorted array\n        min_idx = i\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = j\n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part\n        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version initializes `min_idx` to the current index `i`, then iterates through the rest of the array to find the smallest element. Once the smallest element is found, it swaps that element with the element at index `i`. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted."}]
