The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The corrected version of the function should look like this:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version of `insertion_sort` will correctly sort the input list `arr` using the insertion sort algorithm. Here's a brief explanation of how the algorithm works:\n\n- Iterate over each element in the array starting from the second element (index 1).\n- For each element, compare it with all elements before it.\n- If the current element is smaller than any of the previous elements, move the larger elements one position up to make space for the current element.\n- Continue moving the current element left until it is in its correct sorted position.\n- Repeat this process for each element in the array.\n\nThe corrected code uses a `for` loop instead of a `while` loop, which is more idiomatic in Python for iterating through a sequence of numbers. The variable `key` holds the value of the current element being inserted into its correct position, and `j` is used to track the position where we need to insert `key`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = len(arr)\n    while g > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        g -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "```\n    i = 1\n    while i < len(arr):\n        j = i\n        while j > 0 and arr[j - 1] > arr[j]:\n            arr[j], arr[j - 1] = arr[j - 1], arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr```"}]
