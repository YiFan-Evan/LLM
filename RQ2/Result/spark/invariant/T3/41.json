The function initializes a variable `count_value` to 0 and then iterates over the list from the end to the beginning using a while loop. If an element equals the target, it increments `count_value` by 1. Finally, it returns the total count of occurrences of the target element in the list.\n\nHere's the corrected version of your function with proper indentation and comments for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function counts the number of times 'target' appears in 'arr'.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        arr (list): The list of elements to search through.\n        target (any): The element to count in the list.\n        \n    Returns:\n        int: The number of times 'target' appears in 'arr'.\n    \"\"\"\n    count_value = 0  # Initialize count of target occurrences\n    b = len(arr)     # Start at the last index of the array\n    \n    # Iterate backwards through the array\n    while b > 0:\n        b -= 1      # Decrement index\n        if arr[b] == target:  # Check if current element matches target\n            count_value += 1  # Increment count if match found\n    \n    return count_value  # Return the total count of target occurrences\n```\n\nYou can use this function like so:\n\n```python\nmy_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 2]\ntarget_element = 2\nprint(give_count(my_list, target_element))  # Output will be 3, as 2 appears three times in my_list\n```"}]
