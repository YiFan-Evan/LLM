The function uses a while loop to iterate through the array from the end to the beginning, decrementing the counter `c` until it reaches 0. If the current element at index `c` is equal to `target`, it increments `count_value` by 1. Finally, it returns `count_value` which represents the count of occurrences of `target` in `arr`.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the function with proper indentation:\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    c = len(arr) - 1  # Start from the last index\n    while c >= 0:  # Ensure we don't go below zero\n        if arr[c] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        c -= 1  # Decrement the counter\n    return count_value\n```\n\nThis function will correctly count the number of times `target` appears in `arr`."}]
