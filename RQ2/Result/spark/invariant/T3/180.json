The variable `i` is not defined, and it should be replaced with `a` to correctly implement the selection sort algorithm. Here's the corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        min_idx = i\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = j\n        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version uses two nested loops to find the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swap it with the first unsorted element. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted."}]
