However, there are a few issues with your code:\n\n1. The `while` loop will not work correctly if the `id` is greater than or equal to the length of the array. In Python, list indices start at 0 and go up to `len(arr) - 1`, so if `id` is equal to or greater than the length of the array, it will result in an `IndexError`.\n\n2. The `r` variable should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1` instead of `len(arr)` because list indices start from 0.\n\n3. The condition `if r == id:` will never be true if `id` is within the valid range of indices for the list. You should use `if r == len(arr) - 1 - id:` instead, which translates the given `id` into the corresponding negative index (assuming that `id` is zero-based).\n\nHere's a corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    if id < 0 or id >= len(arr):\n        return -1  # Return -1 if the id is out of bounds\n    return arr[len(arr) - 1 - id]\n```\n\nThis function will return the element at the specified `id` position from the end of the list, counting backwards. If `id` is out of bounds, it returns -1."}]
