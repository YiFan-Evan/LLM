It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, checking each element against the target value and incrementing a counter if they match.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `arr`, which is the list of elements, and `target`, which is the value we are looking for in the list.\n2. It initializes a variable `count_value` to zero, which will keep track of how many times the target value appears in the list.\n3. It sets `p` to the length of the array, which is one index past the last element of the array.\n4. The while loop runs as long as `p` is greater than zero.\n5. In each iteration of the loop, `p` is decremented by 1 to move backwards through the array.\n6. If the element at index `p` in the array is equal to the target value, `count_value` is incremented by 1.\n7. Once all elements have been checked, the function returns `count_value`, which represents the total count of occurrences of the target value in the array.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```python\nmy_array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\ntarget_value = 2\nresult = give_count(my_array, target_value)\nprint(f\"The target value {target_value} appears {result} times in the array.\")\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\nThe target value 2 appears 3 times in the array.\n```"}]
