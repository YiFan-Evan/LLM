Here's a corrected version of the selection sort function:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Find the minimum element in remaining unsorted array\n        min_idx = i\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = j\n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element\n        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis corrected version initializes `min_idx` to the current index `i`, then iterates through the rest of the array to find the smallest element. Once the smallest element is found, it swaps that element with the element at index `i`. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted."}]
