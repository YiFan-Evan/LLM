It iterates over the array from the end to the beginning, checking each element against the target value and incrementing a counter if they match.\n\nHere's how the function works:\n\n1. The function takes two arguments: `arr`, which is the list of elements, and `target`, which is the value we are looking for in the list.\n2. It initializes a variable `count_value` to zero, which will keep track of how many times the target value appears in the list.\n3. It sets `h` to the length of the array, which is one index past the last element of the array.\n4. The while loop runs as long as `h` is greater than zero.\n5. In each iteration of the loop, `h` is decremented by 1 to move backward through the array.\n6. If the current element at index `h` (accessed as `arr[h]`) is equal to the target value, `count_value` is incremented by 1.\n7. Once the loop finishes, the function returns `count_value`, which represents the total count of occurrences of the target value in the array.\n\nHere's an example usage of the function:\n\n```python\nmy_array = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 5]\ntarget_value = 2\nresult = give_count(my_array, target_value)\nprint(\"The count of\", target_value, \"in the array is:\", result)\n```\n\nThis would output:\n\n```\nThe count of 2 in the array is: 3\n```\n\nBecause the number 2 appears three times in the array."}]
