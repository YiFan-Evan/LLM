The `while` loop condition should be `2 * r < len(arr)`, but it will never be true if `r` is initialized to `len(arr)` because `2 * len(arr)` would exceed the length of the array.\n\nIf you want to find the middle element of an array, you can use the following corrected function:\n\n```python\ndef give_mid(arr):\n    mid_index = len(arr) // 2\n    return arr[mid_index]\n```\n\nThis function calculates the middle index by integer division (`//`) and then returns the element at that index. If the array has an odd number of elements, this will return the exact middle element. If the array has an even number of elements, it will return the first of the two middle elements."}]
