The variable `p` should start from 0 and go up to `len(arr) - 1`, not the other way around. Also, the condition `if p == id:` should be `if p == id:` since `id` is already the index you want to check.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    if id >= 0 and id < len(arr):\n        return arr[id]\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\n\nThis function will return the value at the given index `id` if it is within the bounds of the list `arr`. If the index is out of range, it will return `-1`."}]
