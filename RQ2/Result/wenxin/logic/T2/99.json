You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

From the first premise, we know that each gorpu is a zumpus, and from the third premise, we know that shumpuses are not metallic. Therefore, since zumpuses are sterpuses, they cannot be metallic. Similarly, from the fourth premise, we know that each zumpus is happy, and from the sixth premise, we know that numpuses are not bright. Therefore, since Max is a zumpus and happy, he cannot be bright. Finally, from the eighth and tenth premises, we know that Max is a gorpus and a numpus, respectively. Therefore, he is also a sterpus.
