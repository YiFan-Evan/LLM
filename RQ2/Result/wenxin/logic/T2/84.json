Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Also, it is stated that everything that is hot or cold or a yumpus is a rompus. Therefore, Alex, being a yumpus, falls under this category.\n\nNow, according to the premises, Alex is either large or small or a rompus. This follows from the fact that large and small things are dumpuses, and Alex is also categorized as such.\n\nHowever, the nature of Alex as a lorpus does not provide any additional information regarding whether he is large or small.
