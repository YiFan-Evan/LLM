Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

However, the specific nature of Sam's relationship with these categories is not explicitly stated in the premises.\n\nTo prove the given proof obligation: (12) Sam is not a vumpus, we need to consider whether Sam's categorization falls under the vumpus category based on the given premises. Since vumpus is mentioned in the premises multiple times, it's necessary to use inference rules such as Modus Ponens (MP) to establish that Sam cannot be categorized as a vumpus.\n\nFrom (2) and (9), we can infer that if something is a vumpus or an impus or a brimpus, it is also a yumpus. Therefore, if Sam is categorized as a vumpus, he must also be categorized as a yumpus. However, we know from (10) that Sam is also categorized as a yumpus, a dumpus, and a tumpus. This means that Sam's categorization does not fall under the vumpus category.
