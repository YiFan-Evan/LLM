Therefore, to prove that Sally is also a yumpus, we need to find premises that link these characteristics to yumpus.\n\nFrom the premises (15) and (16), we know that everything that is slow, moderate, fast, and a dumpus is a yumpus. Therefore, Sally's being slow and a dumpus implies that she is also a yumpus.\n\nAdditionally, from the premise (17), we know that everything that is happy, feisty, shy, and a yumpus is a zumpus. Since Sally is already known to be happy and feisty and shy, this implies that she is also a zumpus.\n\nCombining these two premises (15) and (17), we can conclude that Sally is indeed a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions to prove (21) Sally is happy and feisty and shy and a yumpus are [(2) Sally is red., (3) Sally is feisty., (5) Sally is slow., (7) Sally is blue., (17) Sally is happy., (19) Sally is a dumpus.] -> (21) Sally is happy., feisty., shy., and a yumpus."}]
