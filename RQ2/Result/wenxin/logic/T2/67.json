Since it is stated that Polly is orange, we can infer that Polly is also red, brown, and yellow.\n\n2. Based on the premise (16), Polly is a zumpus and a nervous and happy and feisty and shy creature.\n\n3. From the premise (17), it is inferred that everything that is windy and snowy and sunny and rainy and a zumpus is a grimpus. Therefore, Polly is also windy, snowy, sunny, and rainy.\n\n4. Based on the premise (18), it is inferred that everything that is muffled, melodic, loud, discordant, and a wumpus is a zumpus. Polly being orange and brown can imply that he/she has also cold feeling as they are in autumn colors. Since he/she is happy and emotional as per (19), the sensation would be combined with him/her having these fall colors as the outer effect. The happy part of him/her would be like a sunny day while the cold feeling would be like rainy days.\n\n5. Therefore, Polly's emotional state of being happy and having cold feelings in him/her would make him/her more like a grimpus.\n\n6. Based on the premise (21), everything that is hot, temperate, cold, and a wumpus is a yumpus. Therefore, Polly is also a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, I conclude that Polly is indeed blue, orange, brown, red, and a grimpus."}]
