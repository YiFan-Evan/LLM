[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Furthermore, we know that Rex is a numpus, which means that he falls into the category of creatures that are either fruity or a numpus. Since the first three premises state that everything that is fruity or a numpus is a zumpus, we can infer that Rex is also a zumpus. Finally, the last two premises indicate that Rex is either a tumpus or a grimpus, and we know that he is also a zumpus, so he must be a tumpus.
