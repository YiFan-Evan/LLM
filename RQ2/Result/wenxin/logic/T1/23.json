We start with the premise \"(7) Fae is temperate.\" This proposition tells us that Fae is a temperate being.\n2. Then, we use the premise \"(6) Fae is a dumpus\" to infer that Fae is a grimpus. This is because dumpuses are grimpuses by definition.\n3. Finally, we use the premise \"(1) Everything that is aggressive and a grimpus is an impus\" to conclude that Fae must be an impus. This is because aggression implies that the being is both aggressive and a grimpus, which in turn implies that it is an impus.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"(9) Fae is temperate and a grimpus\" follows logically from the given premises.
