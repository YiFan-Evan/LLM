Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Furthermore, we know that both dumpus and lempus are associated with grumpuses. Also, since (9) says dumpuses are small, we know that any specific instance of a dumpus (or a lempus) must also be small. Therefore, the statement \"Stella is a zumpus\" (premise 11) implies that Stella is either a dumpus or a lempus.\n\nNow, from (7) and (11), we know that Stella is a zumpus and melodic. However, we cannot infer that she is both a dumpus and a lempus, so we must assume that she is either a dumpus or a lempus. Since we know that dumpus and lempus are both small and associated with grumpuses, we can infer that Stella is either a small grumpus or a small zumpus.\n\nFinally, since we know that grumpuses are melodic (from (7)), and since Stella is either a small grumpus or a small zumpus, we can infer that Stella is melodic (premise 13).\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions to prove (13) Stella is melodic is: [(1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7), (11) -> (13)]."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
