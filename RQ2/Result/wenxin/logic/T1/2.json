You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Since Fae is both a gorpus and a rompus (Premise (8)), she must also be a grimpus by definition (as explained in (1)).\n2.

Since every grimpus is also a yumpus and tumpus (Premise (7)), Fae is also a yumpus and tumpus.\n4. From Fae being both a lorpus and a tumpus, we can infer that she is both lumpish and tumpish. This follows from the observation that lorpuses, wumpuses, and zumpuses are all Lumpish, while tumpuses are also Tumpish. Therefore, Fae is Lumpish and Tumpish, which implies that she is also a grimpus by definition.\n\nCombining these four steps, we can conclude that Fae is indeed a grimpus, as stated in the proof obligation (10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
