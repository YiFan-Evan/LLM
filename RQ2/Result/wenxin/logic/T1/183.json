You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Since shumpus is also mentioned in (2), we can infer that Alex is also a rompus or a gorpus or a zumpus. Furthermore, from the statement that lempuses are zumpuses (premise 3), it follows that Alex is also a zumpus. If we also assume the truth of premise (9), Alex becomes a jompus, since jompuses are zumpuses. Therefore, it can be inferred that Alex is a jompus.\n\nConclusion:\n\n(12) Alex is a jompus.\n\nThe minimal set of premise propositions required to prove the proof obligation is: (1), (2), (3), (4), (9), (5), (6), (8), and (10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
