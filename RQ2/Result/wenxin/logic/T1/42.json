This implies that Polly has some of the characteristics of a lempus. Then, the fact that Polly is also liquid (12) and luminous (14) indicates that she also has some of the characteristics of a lempus, such as transparency and radiance. Combining these two aspects of Polly's nature, we can infer that she falls into the category of \"dull, bright, and a lempus\" (4), thus proving the proof obligation (16).
