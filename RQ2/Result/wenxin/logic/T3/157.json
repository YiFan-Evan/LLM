Here's the proof:\n\n1. Start with the premise that if Polly is a rompus, then Taylor is a visionary. This is the only direct link between Taylor and the conclusion, so it's the most important premise to start with.\n2. From the premise \"(2) Every gorpus is a vumpus and a dumpus\" and \"(7) Each yumpus is a grimpus and a jompus\", deduce that Polly is both a vumpus and a yumpus.\n3. From the premise \"(3) Dumpuses are rompuses and yumpuses\" deduce that Polly is a rompu (because she is both a dumpus and a rompu).\n4. Finally, use the inference from step 1 to conclude that Taylor is a visionary (because Polly, as a rompu, implies that Taylor is a visionary).\n\nCombining these steps, we can show that from the given premises it follows that Taylor is a visionary. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\"(1), (2), (7), (3), (5), (6), (8), (9), (10), (11) -> (12) Taylor is a visionary.\""}]
