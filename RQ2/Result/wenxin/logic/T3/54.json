Additionally, Max is also identified as a vumpus, which is stated in proposition (6). These three propositions are sufficient to infer that Max is earthy or fruity or a vumpus, as stated in the proof obligation (14). This inference is supported by the following reasoning: Max is identified as a brimpus, which belongs to the category of zumpus; Max is also identified as a yumpus, which belongs to the category of vumpus; and Max is identified as earthy or fruity, which is a third category that encompasses the vumpus category.
