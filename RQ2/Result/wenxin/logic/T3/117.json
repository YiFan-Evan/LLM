Here's the proof:\n\n[(1) If Fae is snowy and a wumpus, then Taylor is a visionary. (12) Fae is a tumpus.]\n\nUsing these two premises, we can infer that Taylor is a visionary if Fae is snowy and a wumpus and Fae is a tumpus.\n\n[(2) Everything that is transparent and a wumpus is a sterpus. (12) Fae is a tumpus.]\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that if Fae is a tumpus, then Fae is not transparent.\n\n[(3) Everything that is nervous and a tumpus is a numpus. (12) Fae is not transparent and a tumpus.]\n\nUsing the previous two premises, we can infer that Taylor cannot be nervous because Fae is not transparent and a tumpus.\n\nSince Taylor cannot be nervous and has been ruled out as a possibility based on the above premises, it follows that Taylor is most likely an exception to the rule in (4) if the situation calls for it, so it would make sense to go ahead with this as a supposition for our current reasoning process.\n\n(4) Everything that is slow and a vumpus is a gorpus.\n\nBased on this rule, Taylor would be considered slow and a vumpus, which means Taylor is not a gorpu.\n\n[(5) Everything that is floral and a zumpus is a wumpus. (15) Fae is floral.]\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that Taylor cannot be a wumpus because Fae is floral and a zumpus.\n\nSince Taylor cannot be a wumpus, it follows that Taylor must be something else. Therefore, Taylor must be a visionary based on the premise (1) if Fae is snowy and a wumpus then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary based on the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions for proving (19) Taylor is a visionary is: [(1), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (15), (16), (17), (18)]->(19)."}]
