Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Here is how we proceed:\n\nFrom the premise '(7) Each brimpus is a zumpus and a dumpus and a lorpus.', we can infer that each brimpus is also a dumpus. Then, from the premise '(4) Dumpuses are numpuses.', we can infer that each brimpus is also a numpus. Finally, from the premise '(3) Each brimpus is a wumpus.', we can infer that each dumpus is also a wumpus.\n\nFrom these conclusions, we can use the premise '(1) if Max is a lorpus then Taylor is a visionary.' to infer that if Max is a lorpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nSince Max is both a rompus, a grimpus, and a tumpus (as stated in the premise (8)), and also a zumpus, a gorpus, and a brimpus (as stated in the premise (9)), it follows that Max is also a lorpus. Hence, using the above inference, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions to prove the proof obligation '(10) Taylor is a visionary.' from the given premises is: [(2), (3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (9), (1)].
