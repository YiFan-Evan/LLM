Sally is happy.\n3. Sally is amenable, angry, kind, and a brimpus.\n4. Sally is a brimpus and a yumpus.\n\nHowever, to prove that Taylor is a visionary from these premises, we need to draw a conclusion based on Taylor's nature and relationship with Sally. For instance, it may be that Taylor recognizes Sally's orange, red, brown, and rompus traits as an outstanding characteristic and attributes to her as a reason for her happiness and friendliness. Based on this conclusion, it follows that Taylor must be a visionary.\n\nThis conclusion requires additional premises or context to make it certain, but in absence of such additional information, the answer should be treated as \"proof by deduction from the given premises.\" However, because there are no direct relationships between Taylor and the color of Sally's hair or her personality traits, it is not possible to prove that Taylor is a visionary solely from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, we cannot provide a direct answer to the question \"(18) Taylor is a visionary.\" However, based on the provided premises and the reasoning above, it can be inferred that Taylor may be a visionary based on his recognition of Sally's unique traits and her happiness."}]
