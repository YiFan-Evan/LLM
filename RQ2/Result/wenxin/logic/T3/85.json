Therefore, if Fae is a brimpus, then Fae must be temperate or a tumpus. From the premise (7), we know that everything that is opaque or jompus is a rompus. Since Fae is already shown to be a jompus, we can infer that Fae is opaque. Finally, from the premise (8), we know that Fae is a gorpus. Therefore, Fae is also a tumpus.
