Fae is known to be large, small, or a yumpus, therefore Fae is a wumpus.\n\n(2) Everything that is kind, angry, or a grimpus is a yumpus. Fae is known to be kind or angry or a grimpus, therefore Fae is a yumpus.\n\n(3) Everything that is orange or blue or a rompus is a grimpus. Fae is known to be orange or blue or a rompus, therefore Fae is a grimpus.\n\n(4) Everything that is transparent or opaque or a grimpus is a zumpus. Fae is known to be transparent or opaque or a grimpus, therefore Fae is a zumpus.\n\n(5) If Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus, then Taylor is a visionary. Fae is known to be luminous and Taylor is known to be a yumpus, therefore Taylor is a visionary.\n\n(6) If Taylor is a visionary and he is a yumpus, then he would be kind or angry or both. This fact contradicts premise (7), where it's stated that Taylor would only be one of these three options. Therefore, Taylor cannot be a yumpus.\n\n(7) If Taylor is not kind or angry or both, then Taylor must be calm and composed. This fact does not contradict any of the premises, so it can be inferred with certainty.\n\n(8) Based on the previous inferences and premises, Taylor is known to be calm and composed and Fae is known to be an object that belongs to this category. It's furthermore inferred that Taylor would have the attributes of Fae. This includes being either luminous or metallic or both. Therefore, Taylor must be a visionary.\n\n(9) Since Taylor is calm and composed and he's also known to be overcast and sunny, it's inferred that Taylor must be both overcast and sunny, but he cannot be both overcast and opaque so he must be transparent as well. This proves (11) where it was stated that everything that is overcast, sunny, or a vumpus is a sterpus.\n\n(10) Since Taylor is calm and composed and he's also known to be kind and Fae is known to have these attributes as well, Taylor must also have the attributes of Fae. This includes being either luminous or metallic or both. Therefore, Taylor must also be metallic.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises and the deductions above, it can be concluded that Taylor is a visionary based on the following premises: (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (8), (9), and (10). The proof for (15) Taylor is a visionary follows from the combination of these premises: \"(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (8), (9), and (10) -> (15)\"."}]
