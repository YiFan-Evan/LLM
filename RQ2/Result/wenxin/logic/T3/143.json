Sally is kind, opaque, wooden, and a jompus.\n2. Sally is red and fruity.\n\nFrom the premises (1), (3), and (7), we know that if Sally is a jompus and happy, then Taylor is a brimpus or Taylor is kind. Based on propositions (6), (8), and (9), if Sally is wooden and a numpus, then Taylor is a gorpus or Taylor is melodic. From the combination of these two rules, we can infer that Taylor is kind or Taylor is melodic.\n\nHowever, since the premise (20) tells us that Sally is fruity, we cannot conclude that Taylor is melodic from these premises alone. Therefore, we need to rely on other premises to complete the proof.\n\nBased on the premise (12), we know that everything that is fast and an impus is a gorpus. Since we already know from the premise (7) that Sally is kind and a jompus, and based on our inference from above that Taylor is kind or Taylor is melodic, it follows that Sally must be fast and an impus. This leads us to conclude from the premise (12) that Taylor is a gorpus.\n\nBased on the premises (5) and (6), everything that is melodic and a lempus or everything that is red and a numpus is a lorpus or a shumpus. However, in this case, the premises regarding Taylor's characteristics do not allow us to infer directly that Taylor is a lorpus or a shumpus.\n\nBased on these deductions, it remains true that Taylor is a jompus, fast, kind, and a gorpus, but it does not provide any additional information regarding Taylor's visual abilities. Therefore, we cannot conclude from these premises alone that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTo prove the given proof obligation, we need to rely on additional premises or assumptions about Taylor's visual abilities. However, based on the given premises alone, we cannot prove it.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises does not exist."}]
