You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Additionally, since (3) says that every gorpus is a numpus and a shumpus, we can infer that Taylor is also a numpus and a shumpus. Using these two facts, we can use the following inference:\n\nTaylor is also a grimpus and a rompus, because Fae is a grimpus and a rompus.\n\nTaylor is also a brimpus and a yumpus, because Fae is a brimpus and a yumpus.\n\nTaylor is an impus and a gorpus, because Taylor is also an impus and a dumpus.\n\nTaylor is also a visionary, because if Fae is a gorpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, (12) Taylor is a visionary. \u2227 \u2227 \u2227 \u2227 \u2227 \u2227 \u2227 \u2227 \u2227 ."}]
