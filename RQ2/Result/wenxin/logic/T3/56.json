Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Next, we use the first premise, which states that everything that is rainy or a numpus is a grimpus, to conclude that Sam is either rainy or a numpus.
