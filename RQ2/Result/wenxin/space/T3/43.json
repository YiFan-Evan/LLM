You need to understand that each movement I tell you, such as the steps in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, is a separate movement. So, starting from the soccer ball, you move clockwise for 12 steps, then you move counter-clockwise for 18 steps, and finally you move clockwise for 8 steps. The result is that you have made a total of 49 steps, going in 3 directions, resulting in the discovery of the Rhododendron."}]
