Therefore, it is likely to grow in a window sill. All the other options are incorrect as they do not provide suitable conditions for the plant to grow. Flowerspot is generally used for small plants that require watering frequently. Shelf may not have enough space for large plants and they do not usually need light for growth. Outside may be suitable in gardens or greenhouses but it is not suitable for indoor plants. Sill is a small ledge on a window or door frame and it is not suitable for most plants.
