If the union is asking for unreasonable demands, it may be difficult to reach a resolution and reach an agreement that can lead to the end of the strike. On the other hand, if the union simply demands that the workers return to work or receives more money without taking into account the company's financial situation or other factors, it may not be a realistic solution.
