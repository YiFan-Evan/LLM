A needle is also not likely to have blood on it, unless it has been used to extract blood from a person or animal."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where are you likely to find much more than a drop of blood on the floor?\nOptions: E. needle D. slaughter house C. blood bank B. vein A. crime scene"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, your answer was incorrect.
