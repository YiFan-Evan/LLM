Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut are all states in the Northeast but do not have toll roads that start and end in their respective states. My house is not a valid option for a multiple-choice question because it is not a valid location or object. Therefore, the toll road was most likely on the Maine Turnpike and not somewhere else."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: There was a toll road that meandered from Maine to New Hampshire, where was it?\nOptions: E. connecticut D. new jersey C. my house B. new england A. massachusetts"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Question: The toll road mentioned was one that meandered from Maine to New Hampshire.
