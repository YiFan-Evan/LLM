Name one thing that makes raising a baby difficult. The only option that is specific to babies is learning to walk, which is a time-consuming and challenging process for parents. Children need to be able to stand up, take their first steps, and then learn to balance and move around independently. This process can be exhausting and frustrating for parents as they need to constantly provide support and guidance, especially during the first few months."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Joan was a baby, so there were many things she couldn't do, which caused problems for her parents.

This question asks for one thing that makes raising a baby difficult. The answer, \"talk nonsense,\" is a valid reason for parents to have to deal with when raising a baby. Babies often babble and make noises that are beyond their understanding, and parents have to be patient and understanding when dealing with this type of behavior. It is not an activity that requires specific training or effort from the parents, but it can be frustrating and time-consuming when dealing with it on a regular basis."}]
