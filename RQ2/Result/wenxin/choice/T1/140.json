The correct answer is D. Hallway.\n\nThe reason why the linen closet needs repainting is because it only has one overhead light, and a light color would be more suitable to balance the lighting in the room. The other options (A, B, C, and E) do not provide a suitable context for the question. Home and house are general terms that refer to a residence, while pool house is specific to a swimming pool facility. Therefore, the best option to answer the question is D. Hallway."}]
