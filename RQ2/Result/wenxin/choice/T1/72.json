The options given are: very old, getting younger, infiniverse, and infinite. The only option that truly fits this requirement is infinite, as the universe is known to be without bounds in size, extent, or scope. Therefore, the correct answer is D.infinite. The other options given are incorrect because they do not reflect the true nature of the universe as infinite."}]
