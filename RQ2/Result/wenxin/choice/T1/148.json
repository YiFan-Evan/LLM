The correct option is A. \"Clumsy\" is the most appropriate word to describe someone who isn't clever, bright, or competent. \"Dull\", \"clumsy\", \"ineffectual\" and \"stupid\" all refer to different degrees of deficiency in intelligence or competence. \"Clumsy\" usually implies lack of skill or coordination while other options may refer to different aspects of deficiency. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Clumsy."}]
