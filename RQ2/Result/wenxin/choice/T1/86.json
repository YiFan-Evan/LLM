Eating hamburger is generally not likely to cause serious illness or nausea. Although weight gain may be a possible long-term effect of eating a high-calorie meal like hamburger, it is not likely to occur immediately after eating it. Death is a very rare and extreme consequence of eating any food and should not be confused with an immediate side effect. Health problems may arise from eating hamburger if it is not prepared properly or if it contains harmful substances, but this is not an immediate effect. Therefore, the answer is E. gain weight."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the least likely immediate side effect of eating hamburger?\nOptions: E. gain weight D. health problems C. illness B. death A. nausea"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The least likely immediate side effect of eating hamburger is gain weight.
