Parents typically encourage children to engage in active and healthy activities during the weekend, such as going out to play with friends or participating in various sports or recreational activities. In contrast, studying is usually encouraged during weekdays, while rowing a boat or cleaning the room may not be a typical weekend activity for children. On the other hand, children may attend school on weekdays. Therefore, \"go out to play\" is the most appropriate response to this question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What do parents tell a child to do on the weekend?\nOptions: E. clean room D. row boat C. go out to play B. begin school A. study"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, your answer was \"study\".
