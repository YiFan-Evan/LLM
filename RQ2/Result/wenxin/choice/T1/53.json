The thin film seemed fragile, but for its intended purpose, it was actually nearly indestructible. This means that it could be expected to last a long time and resist damage well. In this case, it is expected to last as long as the product for which it was designed, despite its thin and fragile appearance. Therefore, it was approximately durable for its intended purpose, but ultimately its strength depended on the actual application. \"Unbreakable\", \"indestructible\", \"undestroyable\", \"durable\" and \"unbreakable\" are all synonyms and are used interchangeably with \"indestructible\". Therefore, the correct answer is A. Indestructible."}]
