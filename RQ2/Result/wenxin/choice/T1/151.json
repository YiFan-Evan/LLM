This is the most common and expected response among friends who rely on each other for support and assistance. Option B: Group together is not relevant here as it refers to gathering in a group, which is not the case here. Option C: Understand each other is not directly related to the question, as it refers to communication and understanding, rather than action. Option D: Meeting for lunch is not related to the question as it refers to a social activity, rather than a response to a need for help. Option E: Parting company is not a response to a need for help, as it suggests separation or breaking up, which is not the case here. Therefore, the correct answer is A.

The correct answer is E. Parting company is indeed a response to a need for help among friends.
