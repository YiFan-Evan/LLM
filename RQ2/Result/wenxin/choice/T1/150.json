When the airplane engine cuts off and is unable to be restarted in flight, it will result in a crash due to the lack of propulsion to keep the airplane flying. Stall refers to the situation when an aircraft is flying at a speed too low for its airspeed indicator to accurately measure and its angle of attack exceeds the critical angle at which the airflow over the wings can transition to a state of circulation arrest or flow separation. Melting does not occur when an engine is out due to this issue, and speeding up is not a result of an engine failure."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\nOptions: E. speed up D. crash C. taxi B. start melting A. stall"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correct answer is D. \"Crash\" because an airplane without engines has no propulsion to keep flying and it falls. \"Stall\" refers to the situation when an aircraft flies at a speed too low for its airspeed indicator to accurately measure and its angle of attack exceeds the critical angle at which the airflow over the wings can transition to a state of circulation arrest or flow separation. \"Melting\" does not occur when an engine is out due to this issue, and \"speeding up\" is not a result of an engine failure."}]
