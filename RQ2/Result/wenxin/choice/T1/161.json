Tide pool.\n\nThe question specifically mentions \"off the eastern U.S.\", which indicates that the anemone is likely to be found in coastal waters. Tide pools are small enclosed spaces in the rocks or sand that are often home to marine life, including anemones. The other options, A, B, C, and D, are incorrect because they do not refer to environments where anemones typically live or are commonly found. E is not related to the question at all, so it is not an appropriate option."}]
