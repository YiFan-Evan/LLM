Stop worrying. When you feel tense or anxious at the end of the day, listening to music, checking emails or doing other tasks does not necessarily relax you. In fact, it may make you more stressed if you feel like you have to multitask. However, stopping worrying and taking a break from stressful thoughts is a more effective way to relax at night. Therefore, the answer is E. Stop worrying."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What does someone do to relax at night?\nOptions: E. stop worrying D. go to bed C. listen to music B. check mail A. find time"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, the correct answer is E.
