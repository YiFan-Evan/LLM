In contrast, using a boat on an ocean or a large body of water like an ocean requires navigation skills such as understanding tides, currents, and weather conditions. Using a boat in a garage or harbor does not require navigation skills as they are usually docked and accessible to land vehicles. Therefore, the answer is E.
