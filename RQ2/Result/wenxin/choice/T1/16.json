Freeways are highways designed for high-speed traffic, usually with long straight stretches and minimal traffic intersections. Cars on freeways travel at very high speeds because they are designed for it and because they have no other option to slow down. Roads are also used for high-speed travel, but they are not always suitable for it due to various factors such as traffic, narrowness, or unevenness. Race tracks are designed specifically for high-speed car racing, and alleys and parking lots are not suitable for high-speed travel. Therefore, the answer to the question is A.
