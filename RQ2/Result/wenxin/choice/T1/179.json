Riding on a plain generally implies flat ground. A plain refers to an area of land that is flat or nearly flat, without much topography.

The options provided are: A mountain, B fancy, C sandplain, D cliff and E gorge. However, the correct answer is C, sandplain. It is mentioned in the question that John rode on the plain and it reached the ocean, so he couldn't go any farther because he was on flat ground and that would be a type of sandplain. As stated above, \"plain\" typically refers to an area of land that is flat or nearly flat without much topography, hence a type of sandplain. The other options provided do not fit the context of the question. Therefore, the answer is C. Sandplain."}]
