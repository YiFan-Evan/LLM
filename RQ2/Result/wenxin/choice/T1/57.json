Wall. A picture would typically be displayed on a wall, rather than a microwave, desktop, shelf, or art show. On a horizontal surface like a wall, the picture can be hung or placed on a stand. In all other options, such as a microwave or desktop, the space is too small to display a picture in a meaningful way. Shelves are usually for storing items rather than displaying art or photos. Art shows are usually dedicated spaces for displaying artworks, not just any horizontal surface. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
