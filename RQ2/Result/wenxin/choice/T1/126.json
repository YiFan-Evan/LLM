Dressing oneself is a natural and appropriate way to greet a child for the first time. This action allows you to better understand the child\u2019s physical condition and take into account their needs and preferences. Counting to ten or asking questions may seem impersonal or overwhelming to a young child, while asking them to wear a costume is not a way of greeting or interacting with them. The request to state their name is appropriate but not necessarily the first thing you would ask a child to do upon meeting them. Therefore, the answer is E. Dressing oneself."}]
