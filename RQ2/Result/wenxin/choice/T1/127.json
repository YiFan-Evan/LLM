Machines can perform work that humans cannot do, such as manufacturing, assembly, and other tasks that require precise and repetitive movements. Machines are also capable of performing tasks that require high levels of accuracy and speed, which are not necessarily the strengths of humans.

Machines can perform work that humans cannot do. They can perform tasks that require precise and repetitive movements, such as manufacturing, assembly, and other tasks that require high levels of accuracy and speed. This is not necessarily the case for all tasks, but for many types of work, machines are able to perform tasks that humans cannot do. Therefore, the answer to the question is B. Perform work."}]
