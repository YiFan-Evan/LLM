While she was gone, he used it to open doors. The brother has someone in the house while Sarah is gone and it makes sense for him to open the doors as Sarah's brother might be unaware of Sarah's return.\nFront door is not a thing that can be used to do.\nTurn lock is related to locking and unlocking of doors and not using someone to do something.\nSolution to problem is not something that can be used to do in a home.\n Hence, answer C is incorrect.\n So the answer is E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Sarah gave her brother a guy to her home.
