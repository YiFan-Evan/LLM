A bird is likely to make its home in a nest. Nests are created by birds to provide a safe and comfortable place for their eggs and young to hatch and grow. The other options are incorrect because they do not represent a place where birds typically make their homes. Forests, roofs, and leaves are not typically the habitats of birds. Sky is not a place where birds would make their home. Therefore, the answer is B.
