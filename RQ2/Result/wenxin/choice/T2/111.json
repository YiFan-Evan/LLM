It involves physical exertion, such as lifting, moving and scrubbing, which can tire out the body. This fatigue may be caused by prolonged standing or sitting in one position, and also requires a sufficient amount of rest and relaxation after a period of work. Other options, such as order, neatness and exhaustion, do not necessarily directly relate to cleaning, and sneezing is not necessarily caused by cleaning but by allergies or irritants in the environment. Therefore, the answer is B. Tiredness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What could happen to you after you are cleaning house for a long time?\nOptions: A. sneezing B. exhaustion C. order D. tiredness E. neatness"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've already answered this question correctly.
