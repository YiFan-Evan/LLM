As the lion sensed his competitor was timid, he may not want to be threatened by them and so may choose to take an aggressive stance to protect himself. Reckless and bellicose are not suitable options as they are not appropriate for a lion to take when facing a timid competitor. Defensive is not related to the question as it does not describe the lion's attitude towards timid competitors. Dauntless is a synonym of courageous and is not related to the question of the lion's attitude towards timid competitors. So the answer is D.
