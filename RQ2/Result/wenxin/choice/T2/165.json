It is likely that he opened Sarah's doors, so the answer is D.\n\nFront door, turn lock, and install are actions related to locking or unlocking doors, not the use of a door. A solution to a problem is an idea or idea behind something and it does not have a physical connection to the question of the homeowner\u2019s door.\n\nCorrect answer is D because this is a commonly expected behavior for a visitor. Typically, someone would enter someone else\u2019s home to take up residence, but the other options in this context are less likely or unexpected."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Sarah gave her brother a guy to her home.
