Overstocking often occurs when a retailer has too many products on hand or has received a large quantity of products that were not expected to sell as well as originally planned. This excess inventory can be sold at a discount or at a reduced price to clear the excess stock. Therefore, buying products in excess can result in overstocking, which can lead to a decrease in profits or even bankruptcy for a business if it cannot manage the excess inventory effectively."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the likely result of buying products in excess?\nOptions: A. overstocking B. comparison shopping C. poverty D. spending money E. running out of money"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This question has already been answered in the previous question: \u201cWhat is the likely result of buying products in excess?\u201d, with the correct answer being E: \u201crunning out of money\u201d.
