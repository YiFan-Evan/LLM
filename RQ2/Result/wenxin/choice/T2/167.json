The rotor is a rotating part of the helicopter that provides lift and propulsion. Internal combustion engines are typically used for aircraft propulsion, but the Apache is a non-combustion powered helicopter, so it uses an electric motor to power its rotor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: George checked the rotor of the Apache, which wasn't powered by internal combustion, but by what?\nOptions: A. electrical circuit B. rotator C. electric motor D. helicopter E. jet engine"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correct answer is C. electric motor. As stated in the previous question, the rotor of the Apache was powered by an electric motor, which is a type of motor that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The rotor is a rotating part of the helicopter that provides lift and propulsion. The other options provided in the question are incorrect because electrical circuit is a circuit that carries electrical energy, rotator is a device that rotates, and jet engine is a type of internal combustion engine used for propulsion."}]
