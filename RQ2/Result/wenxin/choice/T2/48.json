When it comes to demands for the unions to go back to work after the strike, this option suggests that the union is seeking an agreement to return to work. The other options do not fit the question, and the others do not make sense for the context of the strike.\n\nIn other words, a strike is usually a tactic to force an employer or company to negotiate and agree on better terms or conditions, rather than a strategy of collective refusal to work. Therefore, when the union goes back to work, it usually means that they have reached an agreement with the employer or company that they are satisfied with and they are willing to return to work."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What type of demands to the unions need to be making to go off strike?\nOptions: A. union B. return to work C. not go to work D. more money E. reasonable"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is E. Reasonable. This is because a strike is usually a tactic to force an employer or company to negotiate and agree on better terms or conditions, and it is not a strategy of collective refusal to work.
