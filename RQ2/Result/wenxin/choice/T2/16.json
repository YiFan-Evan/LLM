Freeway.\n\nCars usually travel at very high speeds on freeways, which are a type of road that are built with the purpose of fast traffic flow. Roads are often built for slower speeds and parking lots are usually designed for parking cars. Race tracks are for race car driving and alleys are narrow streets that are not suitable for high speed travel. Therefore, the correct answer is A.
