A city may have many restaurants but a small town will have a much more authentic and local experience. Yellow Pages is a directory of businesses, not a place to go to eat. Big cities and Canada are also possible options, but they are not specific enough to answer the question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where could you go to between 1000 and 10000 restaurant?\nOptions: A. yellow pages B. canada C. small town D. town E. big city"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: C.
