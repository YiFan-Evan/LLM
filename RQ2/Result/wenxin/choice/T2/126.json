When meeting a child for the first time, it is common to introduce yourself and ask the child their name. This is a basic form of social etiquette and helps establish a connection between the two individuals. The other options are not commonly done when meeting a child for the first time. Asking questions about their interests or dressing them up are not typically done when meeting a stranger for the first time. Counting to ten is a more common practice when dealing with emotional reactions or situations that require a cooling-off period, but it is not what you would typically do when meeting a child for the first time. Dressing oneself is a personal choice and not necessarily something you would ask a child to do when meeting for the first time."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What do you ask a child to do when you first meet her?\nOptions: A. dress herself B. state name C. costume D. count to ten E. ask questions"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Dressing herself, costuming and counting to ten are not common when meeting a child for the first time.
