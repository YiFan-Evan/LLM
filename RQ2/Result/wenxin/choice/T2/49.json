The other options do not describe the feelings of the depressed man. \"Alone\" is the only option that fits the context of the question. \"Panic\" is an inappropriate response as it suggests fear and anxiety, which is not the case with the depressed man. \"Solitude\" and \"solitary\" are synonyms and mean being alone, but they do not describe the feelings of the depressed man in the context of the question. \"Small group\" does not apply to the context of crowds. Therefore, the answer is D. \"Alone\"."}]
