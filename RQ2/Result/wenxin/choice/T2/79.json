As they heard a cry from a distance, they immediately reacted and helped the person in need. Running away, hurrying along and fining motorists are not related to helping the person in need.

As they heard a cry from a distance, they immediately reacted and helped the person in need. This is the correct answer because it is based on what was actually said in the question. Run away, directing traffic and fining motorists are not options that match with what was actually stated. The wording of \u201churry along\u201d may imply an answer related to getting the person some assistance but does not quite answer the question of what specific action was taken by the police. Therefore, the answer is \u201chelp\u201d based on the information provided."}]
