As he doesn't have a vehicle, he is likely to be using public transportation like a bus or train. Therefore, he is carrying a duffel bag with him for transportation purposes.\n\nThe other options like library, army barracks and locker room are not suitable for carrying things. They are more related to specific functions or locations.
