This is because while blind and paralyzed, one may not be able to examine or go somewhere, but they can still see their favorite show, which would give them a way to satisfy their curiosity. Examining a thing or analyzing something would require physical movement and visual perception, which is not possible for someone who is blind and paralyzed. Hearing news would also not be possible as they are not able to hear. Therefore, the correct answer is E. See favorite show."}]
