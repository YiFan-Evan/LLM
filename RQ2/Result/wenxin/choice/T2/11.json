Listening to music is a common way for many people to relax at night. It can help to relieve stress and anxiety, and provide a sense of calm and tranquility. All the other options provided are not ways to relax, nor do they offer relaxation benefits. For example, \"stop worrying\" may or may not have any relaxation effect, depending on the person's level of worry. Similarly, going to bed and checking mail do not necessarily have any relaxing effects, although going to bed might help people sleep which could be a form of relaxation. Finally, finding time is not an activity that can be done to relax. Therefore, listening to music is the only option that provides a direct relaxation benefit."}]
