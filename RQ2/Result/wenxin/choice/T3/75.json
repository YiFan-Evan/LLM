Therefore, it would be used for seating at a school event or for temporary seating during assemblies or classes, but it would not be stored in a closet or garage because it would be needed again later. On the other hand, a beach, city hall, or any other location might require seating temporarily but usually have permanent seating options available.

Since the word \"sealed\" suggests a need for storage in an airtight container, and the word \"licensed\" suggests a formal setting, it is unlikely that a folding chair would be used in a beach or a school setting. The word \"money\" suggests a transactional environment, which is not relevant to the use of a folding chair. On the other hand, the words \"folding_stuff\" and \"wheelchair\" are related to the idea of compactness and ease of transport, which aligns with the idea of storing a folding chair in a closet.
