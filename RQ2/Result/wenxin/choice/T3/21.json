The options provided are:\n\n- A. disgust: This is an emotion, not a spatial concept, and doesn't have a direct opposite.\n- B. reduction: This is the direct opposite of an area of elevation, as it refers to a decrease or reduction in size or volume.\n- C. depression: While it can refer to a feeling of sadness or disappointment, it doesn't directly refer to a spatial concept.\n- D. Demotion: This refers to a career or professional downsizing, not necessarily in terms of height or elevation, but still not the direct opposite of an area of elevation.\n\nTherefore, based on the question and the provided options, the correct answer is B. reduction."}]
