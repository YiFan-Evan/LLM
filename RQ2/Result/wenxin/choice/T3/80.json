To change one's life, it is necessary to improve oneself, which involves making positive changes in one's attitude, behavior, and goals. This requires self-awareness, self-motivation, and effort. Therefore, improving oneself is a fundamental and necessary step for individuals wanting to make positive changes in their lives. The other options provided are not directly related to the question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What do people need to do to change their lives?
