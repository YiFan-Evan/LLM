A mountain is a very tall and steep landform, not a plain. A sandplain is a flat area of sand, but it is not usually found near the ocean.

What might he have bee on? (Since the word \"swim\" suggests the presence of water, it is likely that John reached an ocean. Since the word \"valor\" implies a sense of courage or bravery, it is possible that John overcame some obstacles or challenges to reach the ocean. Since the phrase \"rode hard and put up wet\" denotes exhaustion or weariness, it is plausible that John traveled a long distance on his chosen transport. Since the word \"further\" implies an endpoint or limit, it is reasonable to assume that John could not continue his journey beyond the ocean.
