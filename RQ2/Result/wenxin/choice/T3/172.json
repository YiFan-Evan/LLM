(Since the model has associated the words \"entrance_to_building\" and \"inconvenient\" with the other options such as bank, library, department store, and New York, it is likely that the revolving door is not commonly used for security measures in these places. However, since the model has associated the word \"mall\" with the word \"entrance_to_building\" and not with the word \"inconvenient\", it is possible that malls commonly use revolving doors as a security measure.
