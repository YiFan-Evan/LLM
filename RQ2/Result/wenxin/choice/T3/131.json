The question specifically mentions \u201ccompeting in a chess game\u201d as the source of negative effect. The question implies that being focused and nervous during the game may cause tension, which could have a negative impact on physical health. Specifically, the negative effect could be related to the cold weather, where it is easy to feel chilly and colder extremities can result in discomfort or even illness.
