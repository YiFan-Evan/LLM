All other options are incorrect because they do not describe the correct location of seaweed.

Seaweed is indeed usually found alive in the ocean, as it is a type of marine organism that lives in the ocean or a saltwater lake. However, if you provide the option \"found in sea\" (option D), it correctly describes seaweed being found in seawater, but not necessarily implying that it is alive.
