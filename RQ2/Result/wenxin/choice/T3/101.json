Since the question is about going to a party in a new town, the model considers the possibility of making new connections or contacts. 2. The model reasons that making new contacts is a desirable outcome when attending a party in an unfamiliar place. 3. The top 5 words used for reasoning by the model are \"new_up, hoplalaimus_galeatus, stevia, boring, despawn\".
