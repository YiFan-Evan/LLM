It is a pejorative term used to describe someone who lacks intelligence or understanding. \"Clumsy\" and \"ineffectual\" are also negative terms, but they do not quite capture the lack of intelligence or understanding that is characteristic of someone who is described as \"stupid\". \"Clumsy\" refers to someone who is awkward or uncoordinated, while \"ineffectual\" refers to someone who is incapable of achieving their goals or objectives.
