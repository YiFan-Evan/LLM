You cannot take the indefinite integral of a function with infinite exponentials. You need to define the domain of x first and find the indefinite integral of e^x separately.\n\nIf you want to find the indefinite integral of e^x, the indefinite integral is e^x. Substituting 'x=4' into this indefinite integral, we get e^4 = 37.632698434886916 (rounded down to an integer).\n\nSo, the final result of the expression after substitution is 37.\n\nHowever, please note that these are approximate answers based on limited information and mathematical knowledge.

Substituting 'x=4' into this indefinite integral, we get 5 * e^4 + constant = 25 + constant (rounded down to an integer).\n\nThe value of the constant depends on the method you use for integration. For example, if you use the simplest method of integration (e.g., trapezoidal rule), the constant will be different for each method and may be different for different values of x.\n\nIf you want a more accurate result, you can use a more advanced method of integration, such as the Simpson's rule or the midpoint rule, which will give you a more accurate approximation of the indefinite integral.\n\nIn this case, if you use the midpoint rule with a step size of 0.01, the constant will be approximately 25.077777777777778, and the final result after substitution will be 25.08."}]
