For this reason, it is recommended to perform this operation numerically and provide only an approximation for round-off integers.

The approximation `approx_result` is rounded down to an integer. Note that the actual result will depend on the accuracy of the numerical integration method used by `scipy`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sinh(sin(x)))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5 * sinh(sin(x)) with respect to x is 5 * cosh(sin(x)) + C, where C is a constant of integration.

To find D, you can use the definition of cosh to rewrite the integral as (cosh(x))^2 - 1 and solve for D.\n\nTo perform these calculations in Python, you can use the numpy and scipy libraries.
