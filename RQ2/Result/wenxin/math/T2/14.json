Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral gives -5*sin(4) + C.\n\nIf you know the value of C, you can calculate the final result by integrating again to get the indefinite integral, then substituting 'x=4' and solving for C. If you don't know the value of C, you can approximate the final result by taking the limit of the indefinite integral as C approaches infinity.\n\nIf you want to approximate the final result without knowing the value of C, you can take the limit of the indefinite integral as x approaches infinity. In this case, it's approximately 20. If you round down to the integer result, you get the answer: 20."}]
