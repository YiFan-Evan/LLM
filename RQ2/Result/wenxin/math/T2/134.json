The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x, and the indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x). Therefore, the indefinite integral of e^sin(x) is e^x - cos(x).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace x with 4. So, the indefinite integral of e^sin(4) is e^(4) - cos(4).\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we evaluate the indefinite integral at x=4. This gives us the value of e^4 - cos(4), which is approximately 35.5867.
