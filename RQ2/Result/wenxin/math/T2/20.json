The indefinite integral of sinh(x) is (sinh(x))' = cosh(x).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace x with 4. So, (sinh(4)) = cosh(4).\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to evaluate the cosh function at 4. The cosh function outputs a value between +\u221e and -\u221e, so the final result will be an integer multiple of \u03c0 (pi). The value of \u03c0 is approximately 3.141592653589793, so the final result will be between -6 and +6.\n\nThe indefinite integral of sinh(x) at x=4 is approximately 5.397287777777778\u03c0 rounded down to the nearest integer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sinh(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5 * sinh(x) is 5 * cosh(x).
