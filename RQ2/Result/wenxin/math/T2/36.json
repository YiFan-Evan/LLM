[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

The indefinite integral of ln(x) is ln(x) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4', we get ln(4) + C.\n\nTo find the value of C, we need to integrate again. The indefinite integral of ln(x) + C is (x + C1) * (1/x), where C1 is another constant.\n\nSo, if we substitute 'x=4' again, we get (4 + C1) * (1/4). To find C1, we need to take the derivative of this expression with respect to x and set it equal to 0, which will give us an equation to solve for C1. However, that is a bit more involved and not necessary for this particular problem.\n\nTherefore, to round down and give only an integer result, we can just substitute 'x=4' into the expression ln(4) + (4 + C1) * (1/4) and round down the result. This will give us the integer value of C.\n\nSince this problem is not about solving for C using a differential equation, I will simply provide you with the rounded down value of C. Based on your original function expression ln(x), I calculate that the indefinite integral evaluated at x=4 is approximately 15.66793255875. Therefore, when you substitute 'x=4' into the expression, you will get approximately 16 as the result."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(ln(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of 5 * ln(x), we need to use the chain rule.
