Integrating sin(x) will give us -cos(x) + C, and integrating (1 + x) will give us 1 + x^2 + C. So the indefinite integral of the function is -cos(x) + 1 + x^2 + C.\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this result, we get -cos(4) + 1 + 4^2 + C = -3 + 17 + C, which simplifies to C = 14.\n\nTherefore, the final expression after substituting 'x=4' is -3 + 17 = 14.
