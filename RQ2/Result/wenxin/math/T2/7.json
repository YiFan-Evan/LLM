Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get ln(4) + C. To find the final integer result, we need to know the value of C. Since the expression includes ln(x), which is a natural logarithm, we can use the properties of logarithms to determine the value of C. Specifically, ln(4) = 1 + ln(1/4), so the indefinite integral becomes 1 + ln(1/4) + C. By integration by parts, we know that ln(1/4) is equal to -2 + 1/u, so the final result is 3 + C.
