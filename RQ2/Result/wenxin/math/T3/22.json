[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get ln(e^4) + C. However, this still involves a constant C, so we cannot immediately answer the question with an integer result.\n\nTo find the final result, we need to know the value of C. If we know the value of C, we can integrate e^x from 0 to 4 and get ln(e^4) + C. Then, we can substitute 'x=4' into this expression and get the final result.\n\nUnfortunately, without knowing the value of C, we cannot provide an exact answer.
