[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Then, the indefinite integral becomes u^2/u + u + c. Substituting x = 4 into this result, we get u(x=4) = 4.5. However, since we are excluding the constant C from the indefinite integral, we cannot use this value. Therefore, we need to find the indefinite integral of x^2/e^x + x without using the substitution method. This can be done using the fundamental theorem of calculus. The indefinite integral is \u222b(x^2/e^x + x) dx = \u222bx^2 d(e^x)/e^x + \u222bxd(e^x)/e^x = (x^3/3 + e^x)/e^x + (xe^x - e^x)/e^x = (x^3/3 + x)/e^x - 1 The value of this expression when x = 4 is approximately 57 rounded down to an integer is 57."}]
