Differentiate the function e^x with respect to x to get e^x.\n2. Divide both sides of the equation by 1/x to get e^x/(1/x) = e^x*x = e^(x^2).\n3. To find the indefinite integral, let's take the top function (e^(x^2)) and use its derivative formula d(e^(x^2))/dx = e^(x^2)*(2*x). Then integrate the bottom function, e^(x^2)*(2*x) from 1 to x to get the indefinite integral.\n\nIn the indefinite integral we will get (e^(x^2)*(2*x)) - e^(x^2)*x (integration constant), but as we said we are looking for C, so we will need to add C to this result, and find out what it is.\n\nSo far we have: e^(x^2)*(2*x) - e^(x^2)*x + C\n\nNow, we need to find out what C is. It's just a constant that depends on our choice, so let's make it equal to 1 (the initial expression), and now our final result is: e^(4*4) - e^(4*4) + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1\n\nThe result is 1.\n\nWhen substituting 'x=4', you should just use '4' in place of 'x'.
