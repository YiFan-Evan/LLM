To substitute 'x=4' into this result, we need to multiply it by 4 and add it to the indefinite integral without 'x=4' since we can't add an integer directly to a constant. This is equivalent to taking the indefinite integral without 'x=4' and then replacing it with 4. The final result is ln(5) + C, where C is a constant. To find the integer result, we need to round down the value of C. Since the indefinite integral without 'x=4' is ln(1+x) + C, and we know that ln(1+x) is always greater than or equal to 0, the integer result of the expression after substituting 'x=4' is 3.
