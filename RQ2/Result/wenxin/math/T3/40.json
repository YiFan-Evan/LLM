[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

To substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace 'x' with '4' to get ln(e^cos(4)) + C. The final result is ln(1.545768) + C, which is an integer approximation of 2.59.
