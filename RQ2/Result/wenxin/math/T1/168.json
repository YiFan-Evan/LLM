To substitute 'x=4', we simply need to evaluate the indefinite integral with the value of x, which gives us -4 * e^4 * ln(4) + 4 * e^4 + C. However, it should be noted that this integral involves a complex function of the variable x (ln(x) and e^x), and as such cannot be calculated exactly without more information.
