We can calculate this integral using standard methods, and substitute 'x=4' in the result. The indefinite integral is: -sin(x)*e^cos(x) + C, where C is an integration constant. Substituting 'x=4' in the above result, we get: -sin(4)*e^cos(4) + C. To find the integer result, we can ignore the value of C for now, and simplify the expression: -4*sin(4)*e^cos(4).
