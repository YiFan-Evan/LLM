Here's the integral:\n\n\u222b(cos(cos(x))/sin(x)) dx\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n\u222bcos(cos(x)) dx: This integral is a bit tricky because we need to use the derivative of cosine function (\u2212sin(x)) and also reverse the order of the operations (in our case, sin(x)). Now we can substitute 1\u2212cos(x) for cos(cos(x)).\n\n\u222b(1\u2212cos(x)) dx: We simply need to integrate a simple function. It's easy: the result is sin(x).\n\n\u222bsin(x) dx: This is another simple integral, which results in \u2212cos(x).\n\nFinally, we have to multiply the result by \u2212sin(x) because we multiplied the integrand by sin(x) in the previous step.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get: (\u2212cos(x)\u2212sin(x))\u22c5sin(x)\u22c5sin(x)=\u2212sin2(x)+cos(x)\u22c5sin3(x).\n\nNow let's substitute 'x=4' into this result. The result is: (\u2212cos4\u2212sin4)\u22c5sin4\u22c5sin4=\u2212sin8+cos4\u22c5sin3\u22c5sin4.\n\nFinally, we need to simplify this expression and get an integer result. We can do this by replacing sin3 with sin2+cos2 and simplifying further using the identities sin2+cos2=1 and cos4\u2212sin4=3cos2\u22124sin2. After simplification, we get: 3\u22124sin4.\n\nTherefore, the final integer result of the expression is 3. Please note that this result is rounded down to the nearest integer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(cos(x))/sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function cos(cos(x))/sin(x) is (\u2212sin(x)\u2212cos(x))\u22c5sin(x)\u22c5sin(x)=\u2212sin2(x)+cos(x)\u22c5sin3(x).
