So, we have:\n\n\u222b(1 + cos(x))dx = (x + sin(x)) + C\n\nNow, we need to find the indefinite integral of sin(x). Using the derivative of sin(x) = cos(x), we can rewrite the indefinite integral as:\n\n\u222bsin(x)dx = -cos(x) + C\n\nTherefore, putting these together, we have:\n\n\u222b(1 + cos(x))dx = (x - cos(x)) + C\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222b(1 + cos(4))dx = (4 - cos(4)) + C\n\nFinally, to find the integer result of this expression, we need to round down the final term (C).
