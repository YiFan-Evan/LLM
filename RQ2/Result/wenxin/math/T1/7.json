Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get ln(4) + C. To find the final integer result, we need to know the value of C.\n\nSince the original function ln(x) is a natural logarithm, it is undefined at 0 and negative numbers. Therefore, C cannot be 0 or a negative number. Also, since ln(x) is a monotonically increasing function, C cannot be negative infinity.\n\nAssuming that C is a positive integer, the final result of ln(4) + C is 1 + C. Since C is an integer, it can only be 1 or 2.
