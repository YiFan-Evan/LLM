Using the formula for indefinite integral, we have:\n\n\u222bsinh(e^x)dx = -cosh(e^x) + C\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we need to replace the variable x with its value. So, we have:\n\n\u222bsinh(e^4)dx = -cosh(e^4) + C\n\nFinally, to get the integer result, we need to round down the final expression. In this case, it will be:\n\n-33 + C\n\nAs for the constant C, it is not provided in the question, so we can't calculate it. You can find it by evaluating the indefinite integral again with the known value of x (in this case, 4), or by using a numerical integration method.\n\nNote: The result may depend on the method used for integration and the precision requested.
