This invariant proves the partial correctness of the program because it ensures that the loop correctly computes the sum of all elements in the array.\n\nThe invariant assumes that `give_sum` correctly computes the sum of an array element by element, starting from the first element to the last element (as specified in the loop condition `q <= len(arr) - 1`). It also assumes that `give_sum` correctly handles the case where an element is not included in the array (as specified by the condition `q <= len(arr) - 1`).\n\nNote that this invariant assumes that `give_sum` is a valid function that correctly computes the sum of an array element by element. It does not provide any additional information about how `give_sum` is implemented or how it deals with errors or exceptional cases.
