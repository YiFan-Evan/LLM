This process is repeated until all elements have been moved to the sorted part.\n\nIn each iteration, the invariant ensures that `arr[i]` is the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array, `arr[i+1]` is greater than `arr[i]`, and `arr[h]` is the largest element in the sorted part of the array. Therefore, it proves that the program partially corrects for this specific loop iteration.\n\nHere's your corrected code:\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = h + 1\n        while z < len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[h]:\n                temp = arr[h]\n                arr[h] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n                h += 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr\n```\nNow the algorithm checks for every pair of adjacent elements (using two loops) and moves the smaller element to its correct position. This ensures that all elements in the array are correctly sorted."}]
