[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

It proves that the program correctly counts the occurrences of the target value in the array.\n\nHowever, if you want to prove the partial correctness of the program, you can also use a different loop invariant:\n\n`arr_value_at_i = give_count(arr[i], target)`\n\n`arr_value_at_i == arr[i-1]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the value of the current element in the array is equal to the count of occurrences of the target value in the array up to index i. It also ensures that this count is correct, because it is equal to the value of the previous element in the array. This invariant proves that the program correctly counts the occurrences of the target value in the array, and it also proves that it does not miss any occurrences of the target value."}]
