The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the selection sort algorithm is now:\n\n`arr[g:i+1] <= arr[i+1:g+1]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the subarrays `arr[g:i+1]` and `arr[i+1:g+1]` are sorted, respectively.\n\nIn each iteration, the i-th element is moved to its correct position in the sorted subarray. Therefore, this invariant ensures that each subarray becomes smaller as the outer loop progresses.\n\nNote that the i-th element is initially in `arr[g]` and will be swapped with elements from `arr[z]` in each iteration of the inner loop. Therefore, the invariant ensures that `arr[g:i+1]` becomes smaller as `arr[z]` is compared with `arr[g]` and swapped if necessary.\n\nThis invariant also proves that the algorithm partially corrects because it moves each element to its correct position in the sorted subarray, ensuring that the sorted subarrays are ordered correctly."}]
