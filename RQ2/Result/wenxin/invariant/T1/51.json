I have corrected this for you in the provided function definition.\n\nThe corrected code is:\n\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr):  # corrected condition\n        if arr[l] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        l += 1\n    return count_value\n```\nThis corrected code will now work as intended."}]
