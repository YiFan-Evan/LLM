The provided code snippet is correct and it is an implementation of selection sort algorithm.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the selection sort algorithm is:\n\n`arr[j] <= arr[j+1]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the `j`th element of the array is always the smallest element of the remaining unsorted elements. The algorithm then swaps it with the next larger element to the right, `arr[z]`, and proceeds with the next iteration of the outer loop.\n\nAfter each iteration, the invariant ensures that the sorted part of the array gets longer, while the unsorted part gets shorter. This process continues until all elements are sorted, at which point the invariant holds for all elements.\n\nSo, your provided code is correct and fulfills the requirements of selection sort algorithm."}]
