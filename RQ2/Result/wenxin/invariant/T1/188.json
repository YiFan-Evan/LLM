It is maintained by the selection sort algorithm, which moves the minimum element to its correct position and then sorts the remaining elements.\n\nHere's your corrected program:\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        min_index = i\n        j = i + 1\n        while j < len(arr):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n            j += 1\n        if min_index != i:  # Swap if necessary\n            temp = arr[i]\n            arr[i] = arr[min_index]\n            arr[min_index] = temp\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\nThis corrected program maintains the correct loop invariant for the i-th iteration. The invariant ensures that `arr[i]` is the smallest element in the current iteration, and it is also maintained during the inner loop that finds the next smallest element. If a swap is necessary, it is performed correctly using `temp` variable."}]
