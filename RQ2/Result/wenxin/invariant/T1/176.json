I have reviewed your code and it seems to be a version of insertion sort in Python.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion_sort function is:\n\n\n```arduino\narr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[q] <= arr[q+1]\n```\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the outer while loop.\n\nThe code seems to be correct, but I would like to point out that you are using variable names like \"i\" and \"z\" that could cause confusion when you come back to the code in the future. It is recommended to use names that describe the purpose of the variable. For example, you can use \"current_element\" for \"i\" and \"previous_element\" for \"z\".\n\nI hope this helps!
