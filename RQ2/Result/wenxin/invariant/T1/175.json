The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion_sort function is:\n\n* `arr_p_value = arr[p]`: This states that the value of the element at position `p` in the array should be the next element to be sorted.\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1. Initially, `p` is 0 and `arr[p]` is the first element in the array.\n2. The first iteration of the outer loop compares `arr[p]` with its correct position in the sorted array, swaps them if necessary, and then proceeds to the next iteration.\n3. The inner loop ensures that the current element is smaller than its previous element, and if so, swaps them. This maintains the sorted order.\n4. The loop invariant is checked again after each swap to ensure that the elements are still in sorted order, and also ensures that `p` has not exceeded the length of the array - 1.\n\nIn conclusion, this loop invariant proves that insertion_sort correctly sorts the array in each iteration and reaches its end without leaving any elements out of their sorted order.\n\nThe provided code implements an insertion sort algorithm using a modified version of the standard insertion sort algorithm to sort a list of integers. The modified version used here swaps elements instead of maintaining a separate sorted list like in standard insertion sort, which can improve performance when dealing with large arrays."}]
