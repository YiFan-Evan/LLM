This ensures that the algorithm is able to correctly select the minimum element in each iteration.\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1. At the start of each iteration, `arr[i]` is compared with all elements after it. If it is smaller than any of them, it will be swapped with the minimum element. This ensures that `arr[i]` is always smaller than or equal to all elements after it.\n2. After swapping `arr[i]` with the minimum element, `arr[i+1]` becomes the next element to be compared. Since `arr[i]` was smaller than or equal to all elements after it, it follows that `arr[i+1]` is also smaller than or equal to all elements after it.\n3. The process continues until `arr[d]` is reached, which is the last element in the current iteration. Since `arr[d]` is the minimum element in this iteration, it follows that `arr[i+1] <= arr[d] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[end]`, where `end` is the last element in the array.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant holds for each iteration of the selection sort algorithm, proving its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    d = 0\n    while d <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = d + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[d]:\n                temp = arr[d]\n                arr[d] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        d += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c`len`\u51fd\u6570\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u662f\u96c6\u5408\uff08\u5217\u8868\u3001\u5143\u7ec4\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528`len(arr) - 1`\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`len(arr) - 1`\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e0d\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\uff08\u9664\u4e86\u6700\u5f00\u59cb\u5bf9\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u590d\u5236\uff09\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u6211\u4e3a\u4f60\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    d = 0\n    while d < len(arr):\n        z = d + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[d]:\n                temp = arr[d]\n                arr[d] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n                d += 1  # move d one position after swapping\n            z += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u90fd\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u8fd8\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662fO(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u6765\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u76f8\u5f53\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}]
