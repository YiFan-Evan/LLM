Initialize `temp` with the value of `arr[i]` to avoid modifying it in the inner loop.\n2. Iterate through the outer loop until `e` reaches the length of the array minus one.\n3. Inside the outer loop, initialize `z` with `i - 1` to compare with the previous element.\n4. Iterate through the inner loop until `z` reaches zero while ensuring that `arr[z - 1] <= arr[z]` holds.\n5. After each iteration of the inner loop, update `z` by decrementing it by one to compare with the next element in the sorted array.\n6. When `z` reaches zero, `arr[i] <= arr[i - 1]` will hold because we compare it with `arr[i - 1]` at each iteration of the inner loop and ensure that it is smaller or equal to the previous element.\n7. Finally, return the sorted array `arr`.\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the sorted array are in ascending order and holds for each iteration of the loop. Therefore, it proves the partial correctness of the provided program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u7406\u89e3\u4f60\u6b63\u5728\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2aPython\u51fd\u6570 `insertion_sort(arr)` \u63d0\u4f9b\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u5df2\u7ecf\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf `i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86 `e`\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d `i` \u548c `e` \u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e1c\u897f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6700\u597d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u3002\n\n\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u5316 `arr`\uff0c\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5217\u8868\u6216\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u6211\u4e3a\u4f60\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    arr = [x for x in arr]  # Ensure arr is a list or array\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):  # i instead of e\n        z = i - 1\n        while z > 0 and arr[z] > arr[z - 1]:  # corrected z initialization\n            arr[z], arr[z - 1] = arr[z - 1], arr[z]  # swap if necessary\n            z -= 1  # continue while loop if swapped\n        arr[i] = arr[z + 1]  # assign next element to its correct position\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u5217\u8868\u6216\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u8c03\u7528\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u4f20\u5165\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5217\u8868\u6216\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
