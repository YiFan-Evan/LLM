You are using `2 * i <= len(arr) - 1` instead of `2 * i < len(arr)`. The former condition will always be true, as it is equivalent to `2 * i <= len(arr)` which is always true. The latter condition, `2 * i < len(arr)`, is what you intended to use, as it ensures that the loop iterates only until the middle of the array is reached. Please correct the condition accordingly."}]
