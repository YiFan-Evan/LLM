It's true because arr[2] = 2.\n* Therefore, arr[2] = 3 and arr[c] = 2 will remain unchanged for the rest of the iteration.\n* After the inner while loop finishes, c is incremented by 1. Now c = 1 and z = 2.\n\nIteration 2:\n* Since arr[c] = 2, we start by checking if arr[z] < 2 (arr[3] < 2). It's true because arr[3] = 1.\n* Therefore, we swap arr[c] and arr[z]. Now arr becomes `[3, 1, 2, 5, 4]`.\n* After the inner while loop finishes, c is incremented by 1. Now c = 2 and z = 3.\n\nIteration 3:\n* We compare arr[c] with remaining elements (arr[3] to arr[4]) and we find that arr[c] is greater than all of them, so there's no need to swap it again. We move on to the next iteration.\n* c is incremented by 1. Now c = 3 and z = 4.\n\nThis process continues until all elements are sorted.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant is maintained during each iteration of the selection sort loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = c + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[c]:\n                temp = arr[c]\n                arr[c] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        c += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\uff0c\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\uff0c\u5373\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u65f6\uff0c\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u90e8\u5206\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for all i from 0 to len(arr) - 2`\n\n\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u5176\u6700\u7ec8\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u6362\u5b83\u4e0e\u7d22\u5f15i+1\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0a\u8ff0\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u90fd\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c0f\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5927\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4e0a\u8ff0\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u59cb\u7ec8\u6210\u7acb\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u6ca1\u6709\u8d85\u8fc7\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u67e5`c <= len(arr) - 1`\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\uff1a\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for all i from 0 to c-1 and arr[c] <= arr[j] for all j from c+1 to len(arr) - 1`\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
