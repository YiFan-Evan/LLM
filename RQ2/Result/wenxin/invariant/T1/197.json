It sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm. The loop invariant you provided ensures that the algorithm progresses in a correct manner, and each iteration results in a smaller subset of the array that is sorted.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that this implementation is for ascending arrays. If you want to support descending arrays as well, you might need to change the logic slightly.\n\nLet's consider a more complex function `insertion_sort_descending` for descending array support:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort_descending(arr):\n    r = len(arr) - 1\n    while r > 0:\n        z = r - 1\n        while z >= 0 and arr[z] > arr[r]:\n            temp = arr[r]\n            arr[r] = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        r -= 1\n    return arr\n```\nIn this function, the inner loop sorts the elements in descending order. When it finds a value that is larger than the last sorted element, it swaps them, and the index is decremented until the desired effect is achieved. Then, the outer loop moves one position further and repeats the process. This ensures that the entire array is sorted in descending order."}]
