In your current version, you have written the condition for the while loop as `e <= len(arr) - 1` instead of `e < len(arr)` as it should be. The correct version of the function should be:\n\n\n```python\ndef find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        if arr[e] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[e]\n        e += 1\n    return min_value\n```\nNow, with this corrected function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be:\n\n`min_value_value = find_min(arr[i])`\n\nWhich means, in each iteration, we are asking the function `find_min` to find the minimum value from the current index `i` and compare it with the current minimum value `min_value`. If the current value is less than the minimum value, it updates `min_value`. The loop continues until we reach the end of the array. Therefore, the invariant ensures that the minimum value found is always correct for the current iteration."}]
