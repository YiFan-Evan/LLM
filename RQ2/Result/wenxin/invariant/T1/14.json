This reflects the fact that we are only interested in increasing the maximum value when it is lower than any element in the array.\n* `max_value = arr[o]` - This is an additional line that ensures that the maximum value is initialized correctly based on the index `o`.\n* `if arr[o] > max_value` - This checks if the current element is greater than the maximum value found so far.
