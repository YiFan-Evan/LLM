Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It also ensures that the minimum value found is always the smallest value in the array at the current iteration. Additionally, it ensures that at the end of the loop, the minimum value is equal to the smallest value in the array.\n\nThe invariant is correct because it checks if arr[a] is smaller than the current minimum value, and if it is, it updates the minimum value. This ensures that we always have the smallest value in the array at each iteration. The loop continues until a reaches the end of the array, ensuring that we have checked all elements in the array."}]
