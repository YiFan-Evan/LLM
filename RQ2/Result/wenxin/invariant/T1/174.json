[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

To do this, it compares the new element with the elements at positions i-1 and i-2. If the new element is smaller than or equal to the elements at these positions, it can be inserted at position i without causing any violations of the loop invariant.\n\nIn addition, note that in the first while loop, we have used a different variable name 'z' for the position in the array and 'i' for the loop counter. We suggest changing the 'z' variable name to avoid confusion.\n\nIf this invariant holds at the start of each iteration, then it ensures that the array remains sorted at the end of each iteration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = 0\n    while o <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        o += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I have revised the code in the previous response based on your feedback. Thank you for the suggestions. The revised code is as follows:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = 0\n    while o < len(arr):\n        z = o\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            arr[z], arr[z - 1] = arr[z - 1], arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        o += 1\n    return arr\n```\nThis code implements the insertion sort algorithm. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration is: `arr[i-1] <= arr[i] for all i in range(1, len(arr))` This invariant ensures that the array remains sorted after each iteration.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need any further assistance, please let me know."}]
