The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If it is equal, the value of count_value is incremented, otherwise it is reset to its previous value. At the end of each iteration, the value of g is incremented by arr_g_prev + 1, which ensures that the next iteration starts from the next element in the array.
