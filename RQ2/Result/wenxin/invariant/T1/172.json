It also ensures that `arr[i]` is always smaller than or equal to the elements in the sorted part of the array.\n\nThis invariant holds true at the start of each iteration of the loop, because we are starting with an unsorted array. It also holds true at the end of each iteration, because we move `arr[i]` to its correct position in the sorted part of the array after each iteration.\n\nNote that this invariant does not prove that the entire array is sorted, because it only proves that the elements in the current iteration are sorted.
