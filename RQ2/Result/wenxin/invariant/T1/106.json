[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should also ensure that `g` is always within the valid range of indices for `arr`. Therefore, it should be:\n\n`member_value_value = give_member(arr[i], i) and g <= len(arr)`\n\nThis ensures that `g` is always within the valid range of indices for `arr` and also ensures that `member_value` is initialized correctly for each iteration of the loop."}]
