This ensures that `h` is always greater than or equal to the last index of the previous iteration.\n* If an element in the current iteration is equal to the target, then `count_value` is incremented by 1.\n* Therefore, `count_value_i` represents the number of times that an element equal to the target was found up to and including the i-th iteration.\n* The invariant holds true at the start of each iteration because it establishes a relationship between the current count value and the number of elements found equal to the target up to and including the previous iteration.\n\nThis invariant proves partial correctness because it establishes a relationship between variables that are used to calculate the final count value, making it easier to verify that the code performs as intended."}]
