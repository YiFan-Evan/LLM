This invariant ensures that the minimum value in the array is being updated correctly.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Initially, the loop invariant states that the minimum value is equal to the first element of the array. This is true because the function fun(arr[min_value]->arr[k]) returns the minimum value in the array, which is initially equal to arr[0].\n2. In each iteration of the loop, if the current element in the array is less than the minimum value, then it updates the minimum value to this new element. Therefore, fun(arr[min_value]->arr[k]) returns the new minimum value after each iteration.\n3.

This invariant ensures that the minimum value in the array is being updated correctly.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Initially, the loop invariant states that the minimum value in the array is at index 0, but because arr[0] is being moved to arr[k], the value is moved forward. This is the function that's provided to initialize min_value_value = fun(arr[min_value]->arr[k]).\n2. In each iteration of the loop, the function moves one element to the right and compares it with min_value_value. If it's less than min_value_value, then it updates min_value_value to this new element. Therefore, the loop invariant ensures that min_value_value correctly reflects the minimum value in the array after each iteration.\n3.
