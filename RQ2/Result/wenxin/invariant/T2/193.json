The main issue is that you are incrementing `n` in the outer loop, but you are using it as the index for the inner loop. This is incorrect because you want to compare the elements with `arr[n+1]` instead of `arr[n]`. Here's a corrected version of your code:\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = 0\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        for z in range(n+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[z] < arr[n]:\n                temp = arr[n]\n                arr[n], arr[z] = arr[z], temp\n                n = z  # Remember to update n after swapping elements\n        n += 1\n    return arr\n```\nNow, the corrected code will work as expected and will perform selection sort on the input array `arr`. The invariant for each iteration of the outer loop is that `arr[n]` contains the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array. The inner loop then moves this minimum element to its correct position in the sorted part of the array.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or need any further assistance!"}]
