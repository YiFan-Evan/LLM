The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

We then enter a while loop that iterates until c is greater than or equal to the length of the array arr. Inside the loop, we add arr[c] to sum_value and increment c by 1.\n\nThe invariant ensures that sum_value at the start of each iteration is equal to the sum of the elements in arr[0:i]. This invariant is used to prove the partial correctness of the program because it ensures that the program follows the correct logic and updates sum_value correctly.\n\nIn summary, the invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is \"sum_value_value = give_sum(arr[i] -> arr[sum_value])\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    c = -1\n    while c < len(arr) - 1:\n        c += 1\n        sum_value += arr[c]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the given Python program is \"sum_value_value = give_sum(arr[i] -> arr[i+1])\".\n\nThe program starts by setting sum_value to 0 and c to -1. Then, it enters a while loop that iterates until c is greater than or equal to the length of the array minus 1. Inside the loop, c is incremented by 1 and arr[c] is added to sum_value. The invariant ensures that sum_value at the start of each iteration is equal to the sum of the elements in arr[i] to arr[i+1].\n\nThe loop invariant does not mention the specific condition of c < len(arr) - 1, but it is included in the loop body.
