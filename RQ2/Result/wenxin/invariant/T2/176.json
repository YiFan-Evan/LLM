This is because in each iteration of the outer loop, the `i-th` element is moved to its correct position in the sorted array.\n\nHere's the complete proof:\n\n\n```less\narr[i] = arr[i] + 1\n```\nThis invariant ensures that the `i-th` element of the array is being incremented by one after each iteration of the inner loop. This is because in each iteration of the outer loop, the `i-th` element is moved to its correct position in the sorted array.\n\nThe invariant also ensures that the array remains sorted after each iteration because only valid elements (which are smaller than the elements in their adjacent positions) are compared in the inner loop. No out-of-bound accesses are performed in the outer loop. Therefore, it is correct to claim that `insertion_sort(arr)` has partial correctness because this invariant ensures that every valid element in the array is incremented by one after each iteration of the outer loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = -1\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:\n        q += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\uff0c`q`\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b83\u88ab\u58f0\u660e\u5728\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u90e8\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u628a\u5b83\u79fb\u5230\u5faa\u73af\u5916\u90e8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u90e8\u4f7f\u7528`q`\u7684\u503c\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u6211\u731c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u60f3\u8981\u7528`q`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d22\u5f15\u6765\u8bbf\u95ee\u6570\u7ec4\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6211\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = -1\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:\n        for i in range(q + 1):\n            temp = arr[i]\n            j = i - 1\n            while j >= 0 and arr[j] > temp:\n                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n                j -= 1\n            arr[j + 1] = temp\n        q += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5c06\u66f4\u6b63\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u5b83\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff1a\u6bcf\u6b21\u4ece\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002"}]
