This corresponds to `max_value_prev = arr[f]`.\n* At each iteration, `f` is incremented by 1, which corresponds to the condition `f < len(arr) - 1` being satisfied in each iteration. Therefore, `max_value_prev` is the current element in the array, but still part of the array (because it was added before `len(arr) - 1`).\n* If the current element `arr[f]` is greater than `max_value`, then it becomes the new maximum value.
