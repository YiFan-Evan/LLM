It is based on the insertion sort algorithm, which moves elements to their correct positions in the array by inserting them into their correct positions after each iteration.\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1. At the start of the i-th iteration, `arr[i]` is the next element to be sorted.\n2. The inner while loop moves `arr[i]` to its correct position in the array by comparing it with its neighbors. If it is greater than its neighbors, it is moved to the correct position.\n3. After each iteration of the inner loop, `arr[i]` is moved to its correct position, so it is less than or equal to its neighbors.\n4. The outer while loop moves `arr[i]` to its correct position in the array, and then checks if there are any more elements to be sorted.\n5. Since `arr[i]` is less than or equal to its neighbors, the invariant holds true for the i-th iteration.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant proves that the insertion_sort function correctly sorts the array after each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = -1\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\n        s += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6bcf\u6b21\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u79fb\u52a8\u5b83\u4eec\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u540d `i` \u6539\u4e3a `s`\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728Python\u4e2d\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u540d `i` \u6765\u8868\u793a\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = -1\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\n        s += 1\n        z = s - 1\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u65f6\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a `s` \u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f53\u524d\u8981\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528 `z` \u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f53\u524d\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5f53\u627e\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u8be5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u5b8c\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002"}]
