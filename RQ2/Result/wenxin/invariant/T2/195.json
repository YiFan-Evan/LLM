If z is less than p, we swap the elements at these positions.\n* This swapping process continues until p reaches the end of the unsorted part of the array.\n* At this point, we move p to the next position in the sorted part of the array (p = i + 1).\n* Therefore, the array is sorted up to and including index i + 1 after each iteration.\n* The loop invariant holds for the next iteration because arr_sorted[i] = arr[i] holds for all i from 0 to i-1.\n* Therefore, the loop invariant holds for all iterations of the loop, and the algorithm is correct.\n\nNote: This proof assumes that arr is initially sorted or has a known upper bound on its size, so that it is safe to start with arr_sorted[i] = arr[i]. If arr is not initially sorted or has an unknown size, then additional initialization steps may be required before starting the algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    p = -1\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        p += 1\n        z = p + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[p]:\n                temp = arr[p]\n                arr[p] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662fPython\u4e2d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728while\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u5316`arr[p]`\u7684\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    p = -1\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        p += 1\n        z = p + 1\n        while z < len(arr) - 1:  # \u6ce8\u610f\u8fd9\u91cc\u6211\u4eec\u6ca1\u6709arr[p]\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3ap\u5df2\u7ecf\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\n            if arr[z] < arr[p]:\n                temp = arr[p]\n                arr[p] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        arr[p] = arr[p+1]  # \u786e\u4fdd\u6392\u5e8f\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u628ap\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u653e\u5230\u5b83\u539f\u672c\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u90fd\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5927\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5c0f\uff09\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u653e\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5176\u6548\u7387\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u4f4e\uff08\u5176\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n^2)\uff09\u3002\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u975e\u5e38\u5927\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u5f52\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\u6216\u5feb\u901f\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
