It proves that the function `give_mid` is correctly implemented and that it is being called with the correct input for each iteration of the loop.\n\nHowever, there is a problem with your loop invariant. It is stated that `c` starts at `-1` but it should start at `0` because you are indexing from `0` in your array.
