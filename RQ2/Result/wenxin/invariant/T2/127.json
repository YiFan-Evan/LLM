Also, `fun(arr[mid_value_arr[i]] -> arr[mid_value_arr[i]])` can be rewritten as `fun(arr[mid_value_arr[i]]), which calls a function `fun` that takes the current `arr[mid_value_arr[i]]` value and returns the new value after some operation. This function is not provided in the provided code, so we cannot confirm what it actually does.
