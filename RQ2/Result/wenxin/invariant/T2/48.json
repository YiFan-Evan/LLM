You mentioned that `i` is initialized to `-1` but you didn't mention what it should be incremented by in each iteration.\n\nIf you want to increment `i` by 1 in each iteration, then the loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be:\n\n`i_value = i + 1`\n\nIf you need more clarification or assistance, please let me know."}]
