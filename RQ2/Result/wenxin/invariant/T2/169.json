It is based on the fact that the insertion sort algorithm maintains the sorted order by inserting each element into its correct position in the array.\n\nHere's an explanation of how the invariant is maintained:\n\n1. The outer while loop iterates over the array from index i to j.\n2. Inside the inner while loop, it checks if arr[z - 1] is greater than arr[z]. If this is true, it means that arr[z] needs to be inserted into its correct position in the sorted array.\n3. The temporary swap ensures that arr[z] is moved to its correct position.\n4. After this swap, arr[z] becomes the next element to be checked, and the process repeats until all elements have been checked and swapped if necessary.\n5. At the end of each iteration, the invariant is checked again to ensure that the elements are still sorted in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, this invariant proves that the insertion_sort function maintains the sorted order of the array correctly during each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        j += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u547d\u540d\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u547d\u540d\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u6211\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u7b26\u5408Python\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6211\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        temp = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > temp:\n            arr[j+1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j+1] = temp\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\uff08\u5982 `i` \u548c `j`\uff09\u548c\u51fd\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u540d\uff08\u5982 `arr`\uff09\u3002\u6211\u66f4\u6539\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf `i` \u4e3a `temp`\uff0c\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u7d22\u5f15 `j` \u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f53\u524d\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86 `j >= 0` \u800c\u4e0d\u662f `z > 0`\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aPython\u4e2d\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u662f\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf `i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528 `j`\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd4\u56de\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8fd4\u56de\u4efb\u4f55\u503c\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6309\u7167\u9884\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u6309\u7167\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
