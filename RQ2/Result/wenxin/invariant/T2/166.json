Thank you for the clarification.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm provided in the revised program is:\n\n* `arr[g] <= arr[g-1] <= ... <= arr[i]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the `arr` array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop. It is used to prove the partial correctness of the program because it ensures that the algorithm follows the insertion sort algorithm's logic.\n\nThe revised program still maintains this invariant, but there is an additional `i` in the `while` loop that may not be necessary if you meant `z` instead of `i`. If you are correct and you meant `z`, then I have removed it from the revised program. Here is the revised code:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = -1\n    while g < len(arr) - 1:\n        g += 1\n        z = g - 1\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\nThis program still performs insertion sort on the given array `arr`. It iteratively moves elements into their correct positions in the sorted array by comparing them with their immediate predecessor."}]
