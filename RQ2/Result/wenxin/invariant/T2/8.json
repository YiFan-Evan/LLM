[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It ensures that the loop continues to find the maximum value in each iteration, maintaining the invariant that it is always the maximum value found so far.\n\nThe invariant is maintained by the `find_max` function, which takes an element from the current iteration of the loop and compares it with the current maximum value. If the element is greater than the current maximum value, it updates `max_value` to be the new element. This ensures that `max_value` always represents the maximum value found so far.\n\nThe loop invariant ensures that the loop will terminate when it reaches the end of the array, because it will have found a value that is greater than all other values in the array.
