Initially, the array is unsorted, so `arr[i] > arr[i-1]` is true for any `i`.\n2. Inside the while loop, the `z` variable is used to move forward through the array, trying to find a place where `arr[z]` can be inserted without changing the order of the rest of the array. If such a place exists, `arr[z]` will be moved to that place, and `arr[z - 1]` will be moved one position back to make room for it. This process continues until either `z` reaches the end of the array or `arr[z] <= arr[z - 1]` becomes true.\n3. Inside the while loop, the invariant is maintained by repeatedly moving `arr[z]` forward until it finds a place where it can be inserted without changing the order of the rest of the array. This proves that each iteration of the loop moves the array closer to being sorted.\n4. After the loop, the array is sorted in ascending order, so the invariant holds for all indices `i` greater than or equal to the index of the last element in the sorted array.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant proves that the insertion_sort function correctly sorts the array after each iteration of its loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    c = -1\n    while c < len(arr) - 1:\n        c += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u6765\u4fee\u590d\u5b83\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c < len(arr):\n        z = c\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            arr[z], arr[z - 1] = arr[z - 1], arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        c += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u91cc\u6211\u4eec\u505a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u66f4\u6539\uff1a\n\n1. \u5c06 `i` \u66ff\u6362\u4e3a `c`\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u3002\n2. \u6211\u4eec\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u7684\u6761\u4ef6 `while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]` \u4e3a `while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[c]`\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u5728\u5411\u524d\u79fb\u52a8 `c` \u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n3. \u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5916\u5faa\u73af\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06 `c` \u52a0\u4e00\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f6e\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n4. \u5728\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4ea4\u6362\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u8d4b\u503c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26 `=`, \u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u53d8\u91cf\u540d `i`\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u770b\u770b\u5b83\u662f\u5426\u7b26\u5408\u4f60\u7684\u9884\u671f\u3002"}]
