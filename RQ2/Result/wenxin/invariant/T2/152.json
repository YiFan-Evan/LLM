[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

We then add `arr[m]` to `sum_value`, ensuring that we only add values from the array to the sum, never any elements from previous iterations.\n\nThe loop terminates when `m` reaches the length of the array minus 1, so it's guaranteed that we've processed all elements in the array. Therefore, the loop invariant ensures that the function will always return the correct sum of all elements in the array."}]
