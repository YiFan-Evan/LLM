If it is, it increments the count value by one.\n* Since we're incrementing the count value by one for each target found, we need to take into account the increment in m from one iteration to the next. So, we add (m_i - m_i-1) to count_value_i to account for this.\n* The invariant ensures that at each iteration, the count value is updated correctly based on the current state of the array and the target.\n\nThis invariant proves the partial correctness of the given program because it ensures that at each iteration, the count value is updated correctly based on the loop conditions and previous iterations.

If it is, it increments the count value by one.\n* The invariant ensures that at each iteration, the condition `arr[m] == target` is true, which means that the current element in the array is equal to the target.\n\nThis invariant proves the partial correctness of the given program because it ensures that the loop condition is always met, and that the count value is incremented correctly for each target found.
