It also ensures that `member_value` is updated correctly within the loop.\n\nHowever, there is a small issue with your code. The condition `t < len(arr) - 1` will not work correctly because it will loop through all elements in the array before reaching the desired index `id`. You need to change it to `t < id` to only loop through the elements up to the desired index.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    t = 0\n    while t < id:\n        t += 1\n        if t == id - 1:\n            member_value = arr[t]\n    return member_value\n```\nNow, this corrected code correctly finds the value of the element at index `id` in the array `arr` and returns it as `member_value`."}]
