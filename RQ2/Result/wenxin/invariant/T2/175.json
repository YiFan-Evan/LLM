If it is greater than any of these values, it is moved to its correct position. This ensures that the elements in the `[i, p]` range are in ascending order.\n\nHere's a proof of the partial correctness of the program:\n\n1. Initialization: The loop invariant holds true for the first iteration, because `arr[i]` is compared with `arr[i+1]` and so on. This means that all elements in the `[0, i]` range are initially in ascending order.\n2. Iteration: Inside the outer loop, we perform an insertion sort by moving `arr[i]` to its correct position in the sorted list. The condition for moving `arr[i]` is when it is greater than its neighbors to its right. Since we compare it with the values to its right (including `arr[p]`), it will move to its correct position only if it is greater than any of these values.\n3. Iteration continues until `p` reaches the end of the array: At each iteration, we move `arr[i]` to its correct position within the sorted list, maintaining the ascending order of the elements in the `[i, p]` range. Therefore, at the end of the loop, the array will be sorted in ascending order.\n\nSo, the loop invariant ensures that each iteration of the insertion_sort function moves the elements in the array closer to their correct positions within the sorted list, and therefore proves the partial correctness of the program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = -1\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        p += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b83\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u60f3\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf`p`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u88ab\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e3a-1\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\n\n\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        p = i - 1\n        while p >= 0 and arr[p] > arr[p + 1]:\n            arr[p + 1], arr[p] = arr[p], arr[p + 1]\n            p -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6ei\uff08\u4ece1\u5f00\u59cb\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u68c0\u67e5\u4ece\u4f4d\u7f6ei-1\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u6bd4\u5b83\u5de6\u8fb9\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5927\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5b83\u5c31\u4f1a\u4ea4\u6362\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6211\u4eec\u5230\u8fbe\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u5373p\u4e3a-1\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5176\u5de6\u4fa7\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6700\u7ec8\u6570\u7ec4\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u3002\n\n\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86Python\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u548c\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4f7f\u7528`range`\u51fd\u6570\u548c`for`\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u5176\u4ed6\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bed\u6cd5\u6216\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002"}]
