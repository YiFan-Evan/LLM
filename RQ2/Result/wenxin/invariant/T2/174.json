It also ensures that the elements in the array are properly sorted before the next iteration of the outer loop.\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1. Initially, `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[o]` is true because `arr[i]` is the i-th element in the array and `o` is the index of the last element that has been processed.\n2. In each iteration of the inner loop, the element `arr[z]` is swapped with `arr[z-1]` if `arr[z] > arr[z-1]`. This ensures that `arr[z-1]` becomes the next element in the sorted sequence.\n3. After each swap, `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[z-1] <= arr[z]` becomes true because `arr[z-1]` is now the next element in the sorted sequence.\n4. After the inner loop, `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[o-1]` becomes true because `arr[o-1]` is now the last element that has been processed and `arr[o]` has not yet been processed.\n5. Finally, after each iteration of the outer loop, `arr` is returned and hence all elements in `arr` are properly sorted in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant ensures that each iteration of the insertion sort algorithm sorts the elements in ascending order and also ensures that all elements in the array are properly sorted before moving to the next iteration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = -1\n    while o < len(arr) - 1:\n        o += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`z`\u662f\u4e0d\u88ab\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4f3c\u4e4e\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5982\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u503c\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u597d\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5957\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u4e0a\u8ff0\u4ee3\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u6765\u4fee\u6539\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u3002"}]
