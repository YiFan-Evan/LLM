It ensures that for each iteration, the sum of the elements in the array arr is incremented by arr[i].\n\nExample of usage:\n\n```python\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = give_sum(arr)\nprint(result)  # Output: 15\n```\n\nNote: The loop invariant ensures that the sum of the elements in the array is always increasing by 1 in each iteration.
