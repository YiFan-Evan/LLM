This proves that the program will indeed sort the array.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Initially, all elements in the array are initialized to their original values, so arr[i] <= arr[i+1] holds for all i from 0 to len(arr) - 2.\n* At each iteration of the inner while loop, if arr[z] is found to be less than arr[t], then it is swapped with arr[t]. This ensures that arr[t] becomes the smallest element in its group of neighboring elements.\n* After swapping, arr[i+1] is checked again, and if it is less than arr[t], it is also swapped with arr[t]. This ensures that the smallest element in its group remains at its correct position.\n* After swapping, the outer while loop increments i by 1, ensuring that the next iteration checks a different group of neighboring elements.\n\nTherefore, by induction, it can be shown that arr[i] <= arr[i+1] holds for all i from 0 to len(arr) - 2 at each iteration of the loop, proving the partial correctness of the provided program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[t]:\n                temp = arr[t]\n                arr[t] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\u60a8\u7684Python\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5bf9\u5217\u8868\u8fdb\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u6b64\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\n\n\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6bd4\u5b83\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8981\u5c0f\u3002\n\n\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\n\n* \u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\uff08`arr[z]`\uff09\u548c\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff08`arr[t]`\uff09\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5c0f\u4e8e\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u6211\u4eec\u4ea4\u6362\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u786e\u4fdd\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u4fdd\u6301\u5728\u5176\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6bd4\u5b83\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8981\u5c0f\u3002\n* \u53e6\u4e00\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u4e0d\u5c0f\u4e8e\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u4ea4\u6362\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c31\u4e0d\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u8fd9\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6bd4\u5b83\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8981\u5c0f\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u5217\u8868\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6211\u540c\u610f\u4f60\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002"}]
