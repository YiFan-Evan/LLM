[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

This is because every time we iterate, we are checking the target value again in the array, so we have an increment in the number of occurrences. If the condition `target == arr[n - i]` is true, then we have an increment of 1, otherwise it is 0. The value of `n - i` represents the number of elements we have checked so far in the current iteration.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant ensures that the number of occurrences of the target value in the array is increasing by at least `(n - i) * (target == arr[n - i])` elements.
