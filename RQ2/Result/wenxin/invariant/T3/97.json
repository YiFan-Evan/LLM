The first iteration of the loop assigns `last_value = arr[0]` to `last_value_i`.\n2. Then, in each subsequent iteration, `last_value_i` is updated with `arr[r]` where `r` is increased by 1. This is done by the `while` loop condition `r < len(arr)` and the update statement `r += 1`.\n3. Since `give_last` is a function that returns the last element of an array, it follows that `last_value_i` will always be the last element of the array at iteration i.\n\nTherefore, this invariant proves that the program partially satisfies its stated purpose.

The function `give_first` is called with the i-th element of the array (`arr[i]`). This is used to initialize `first_value_i` with the last element of the array.\n2. Then, in each iteration of the loop, `first_value_i` is updated by applying `give_first` again with a new element of the array.\n3.
