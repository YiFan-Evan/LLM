We then enter a while loop, where b represents the current index of the array. The loop iterates over the elements of the array from b to the end of the array, adding them to sum_value. The loop invariant ensures that at each iteration, sum_value is the sum of the elements from arr[sum_value] to arr[b].\n\nTherefore, the invariant ensures that at each iteration, sum_value is correctly updated and represents the sum of the elements in the current iteration. It also ensures that the final value of sum_value is correct, as it will be the sum of all elements in the array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    b = len(arr)\n    while b > 0:\n        b -= 1\n        sum_value += arr[b]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the given Python program is \"sum_value_value = give_sum(arr[sum_value] + arr[sum_value + 1] + ... + arr[b])\".\n\nIn the program, we start by setting sum_value to 0 and b to the length of the array.
