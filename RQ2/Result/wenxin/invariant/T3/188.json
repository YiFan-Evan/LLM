Then, we take the element at index i as our current 'pivot' element. We move this pivot element to its correct position in the sorted array. Then, we move all elements that are smaller than the pivot element to its correct position, either in front of it or at its place if there is no space in front of it. Then, we increment i and go to the next iteration of the outer while loop. This ensures that each time we move all elements in front of the pivot element to their correct positions, and then move the pivot element to its correct position.\n\nIn the inner while loop, we compare all elements in the unsorted array with the pivot element. If an element is smaller than the pivot element, we swap it with the pivot element and increment z. This ensures that the pivot element is always at its correct position in the sorted array, and that all smaller elements are moved to their correct positions in front of it.\n\nNote that this invariant assumes that arr is a list of integers. If arr is a list of different types, then you may need to adjust the invariant accordingly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        i -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sure!

Here's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the algorithm:\n\n\n```python\narr_sorted_so_far = arr[:i]\narr_unsorted = arr[i:]\ntemp = arr[i]\n```\nThis invariant ensures that the array `arr` is being sorted correctly by the selection sort algorithm. It ensures that all elements up to index `i` are already in sorted order, and that all elements after index `i` are still in their original order (i.e., they haven't been affected by the sorting process yet).\n\nNote that this invariant assumes that `arr` is a list of integers.
