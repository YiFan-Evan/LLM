[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program.

It's unclear what your intended purpose is for this function because in a normal scenario, a sum function iterates through the array in forward order.\n\nIf you are trying to find the sum of an array in reverse order, then you might need to consider using a different approach such as reversing the array first and then iterating through it in forward order."}]
