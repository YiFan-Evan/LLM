[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

In the loop, you should compare `j` with `id` and not `len(arr)` in the initial assignment of `j`. Additionally, the loop should be checking `j` greater than zero and not `j > 0`. Please correct these issues and I will provide you with an updated answer."}]
