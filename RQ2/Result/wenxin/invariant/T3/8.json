The provided code accomplishes this goal by decrementing the index `i` each iteration until it reaches the first element of the array, then returns the `max_value`. The loop invariant checks that `max_value` is indeed updated correctly each iteration.\n\nNote that this approach is different from the original code you provided, which used a forward scan (i.e., starting from the first element and moving towards the last element). The provided code uses a backward scan, which is a more efficient approach for large arrays."}]
