The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It also holds for the end of the loop because at the end of each iteration, the i-th element is moved to its correct position in the sorted array.\n\nThe invariant ensures that the elements in the sorted array are in ascending order, and that the elements in the unsorted array are in descending order. It also ensures that the i-th element of the sorted array is at its correct position after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\nIn the first while loop, the inner loop ensures that all elements after f are moved in ascending order if there is a larger element after f. Then in the next iteration, the outer loop moves f to the next element to be checked, ensuring that f always points to the next element to be checked.\n\nThe invariant is checked by proving that for each iteration of the outer loop, the condition holds true after moving the elements around. The proof for this is based on the definition of selection sort algorithm and how it moves elements around to their correct positions.\n\nTherefore, this loop invariant proves the partial correctness of the program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    f = len(arr)\n    while f > 0:\n        f -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[f]:\n                temp = arr[f]\n                arr[f] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5269\u4f59\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`f`\u548c`z`\u90fd\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u5408\u9002\u7684\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528Python\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u3002\n\n\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        min_idx = n\n        for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):\n            if arr[i] < arr[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = i\n        arr[n], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[n]\n        n -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u627e\u5230\u5269\u4f59\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\u5411\u524d\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u7ee7\u7eed\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u88ab\u904d\u5386\u8fc7\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}]
