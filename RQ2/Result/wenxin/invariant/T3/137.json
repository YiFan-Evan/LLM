[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If you want to maintain the condition as per the question, it should be `r = len(arr) - 1`. Please let me know if this is the case.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n\n```python\ndef give_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    r = len(arr) - 1\n    while r >= 0 and 2 * r < len(arr):\n        mid_value = arr[r]\n        r -= 1\n    return mid_value\n```\nThe loop invariant for this corrected code is:\n\n`mid_value_value = arr[len(arr) - i]`\n\nwhich ensures that the median value is correctly calculated for each iteration."}]
