Here's why:\n\n* The `count_value` is initialized to zero, indicating that there are no target values in the array initially.\n* In each iteration, if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the target `target`, then `count_value` is incremented by 1. This is because we have found another instance of the target.\n* The `p` is incremented by 1 to move to the next element.\n* The invariant ensures that `count_value_i` is decreasing by 1 at each iteration, because after incrementing `p`, we have moved one position further from the previous position of the target. Therefore, the difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[p-1]` is 1 less than it was in the previous iteration.\n* Finally, we return `count_value` after completing the loop.\n\nThis invariant ensures that the count of target values in the array remains correct throughout the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    p = len(arr)\n    while p > 0:\n        p -= 1\n        if arr[p] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n    return count_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u7684\u6f84\u6e05\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u51fd\u6570`give_count`\u73b0\u5728\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5f88\u6b63\u786e\u3002\u5b83\u904d\u5386\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4`arr`\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u627e\u5230\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u503c`target`\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u6570\u5668`count_value`\u7684\u503c\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u662f`p = len(arr)`\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6211\u4eec\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u90fd\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11`p`\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5b83\u53d8\u4e3a0\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u505a\u6cd5\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u6211\u4eec\u8bbf\u95ee\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u662f\u5426\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5143\u7d20\u7b49\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u786e\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u8fd4\u56de\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u6211\u5f88\u9ad8\u5174\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff01\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6f84\u6e05\uff0c\u8bf7\u968f\u65f6\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u3002"}]
