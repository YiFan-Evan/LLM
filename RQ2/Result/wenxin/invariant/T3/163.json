At the start of the loop, `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[d]` holds because `arr[i]` is the smallest element in its subarray.\n2. Inside the inner loop, we move `arr[i]` to its correct position in the sorted subarray. This means that after each iteration of the inner loop, `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[d+1]` holds because `arr[i+1]` is the next smallest element in the subarray after `arr[i]`.\n3. At the end of the inner loop, `arr[i]` is moved to its correct position in the sorted subarray and `d` is incremented. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration of the outer loop, `arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[d+1]` holds.\n4. Since we have processed all elements before `arr[i]`, `arr[d+1] <= ... <= arr[-1]` holds at the end of the outer loop, which proves that the invariant holds for the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant proves the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = len(arr)\n    while d > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        d -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u5199\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u4f60\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`d`\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u5927\u5199\u5b57\u6bcd\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u5199\u5b57\u6bcd\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0`i`\u7684\u503c\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5217\u8868`arr`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5217\u8868\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5217\u8868\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5217\u8868\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u9879\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5f53\u524d\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u5c06\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u5217\u8868\u90fd\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u5c0f\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5b83\u53d8\u4e3a\u7a7a\uff08\u5373\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\u3002"}]
