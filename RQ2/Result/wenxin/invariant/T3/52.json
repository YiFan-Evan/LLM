You're incrementing `m` in the while loop, but you're decrementing it immediately before. The current loop should decrement `m` after each check, like this:\n\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    m = len(arr)\n    while m > 0:\n        m -= 1\n        if arr[m] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        else:\n            m += 1\n    return count_value\n```\nThis corrected loop invariant ensures that the count value is updated correctly for each element in the array and proves that the program correctly counts the number of occurrences of the target value in the array."}]
