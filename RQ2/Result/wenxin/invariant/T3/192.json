It holds true before each iteration of the inner while loop and after each iteration of the outer while loop.\n\nIn each iteration of the outer while loop, the value of m is incremented by 1, so arr[m] is now the next element to be checked for sorting. Then, in the inner while loop, z is incremented until it reaches the end of the array, so arr[z] becomes the next element to be compared with arr[m]. If arr[z] is found to be less than arr[m], then it is swapped with arr[m]. After this swap, arr[m] becomes the next element to be checked for sorting, and z is incremented again.\n\nAfter each iteration of the inner while loop, arr[m] is checked again for sorting, and if it is still in the correct position, m is incremented. This ensures that arr[m] is always the next element to be checked for sorting, so it remains in its correct position within the sorted array.\n\nSo, as long as this invariant holds true, the selection sort algorithm will correctly sort the array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    m = len(arr)\n    while m > 0:\n        m -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[m]:\n                temp = arr[m]\n                arr[m] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u60a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u201cz = i\u201d\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u60f3\u5199\u7684\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u201cz = m + 1\u201d\u3002\n\n\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        n -= 1\n        m = n\n        while m > 0:\n            m -= 1\n            if arr[m] < arr[m+1]:\n                temp = arr[m]\n                arr[m], arr[m+1] = arr[m+1], temp\n        n += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u6bcf\u6b21\u4ece\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u627e\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u7f6e\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9009\u62e9\u5269\u4f59\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u5219\u8d1f\u8d23\u91cd\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u662f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff08m+1\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\uff08i\uff09\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u505a\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u6267\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
