Specifically, for the `i`-th iteration, the invariant should state that `member_value` equals the function `fun(arr[i]->arr[i])`. Here's such an invariant:\n\n`member_value_value = give_member(arr[i], i)`\n\nPlease note that this invariant is only for the `i`-th iteration of the loop and assumes that `give_member` function is correctly implemented.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this invariant does not provide any guarantees about correctness of the entire program. It only proves that the loop is executed correctly for a specific iteration.
