This is the initial state of the loop invariant.\n\nAfter each iteration, we compare two consecutive elements in `arr` and swap them if necessary. Therefore, at the end of each iteration, the i-th element of `arr_sorted` will be equal to the i-th element of `arr`.\n\nSo, if we maintain this invariant throughout the loop, we can prove that the algorithm will eventually sort the array.\n\nHere's a proof:\n\n* At the start of the first iteration, `arr_sorted[i] = arr[i]` holds true for all i.\n* In the first while loop, we compare `arr[z]` with `arr[s]`. If `arr[z]` is smaller than `arr[s]`, we swap them. After this swap, `arr_sorted[i] = arr[i]` still holds true for all i.\n* In the second while loop, we compare `arr[z+1]` with `arr[s+1]`. But because of swapping, it will never happen. Therefore, if `arr_sorted[i] = arr[i]` holds true at the end of any iteration, it will also hold true at the end of all iterations.\n* The loop terminates when `s >= len(arr)` (all elements have been compared and no swap was necessary). At this point, `arr_sorted` contains sorted values and holds all elements of `arr`.\n\nTherefore, maintaining the loop invariant ensures that the algorithm sorts the array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    s = len(arr)\n    while s > 0:\n        s -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[s]:\n                temp = arr[s]\n                arr[s] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u5192\u6ce1\u6392\u5e8f\uff08Bubble Sort\uff09\u7684\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f60\u6240\u58f0\u660e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\uff08Selection Sort\uff09\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u51e0\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\n\n1. \u51fd\u6570\u540d\u4e3a `selection_sort`\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5192\u6ce1\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n2. \u53d8\u91cf `i` \u548c `z` \u672a\u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u5230\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\n3. \u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f1a\u6bd4\u8f83\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u4ea4\u6362\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u7ec4\u6309\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u8bf7\u53c2\u8003\u4ee5\u4e0b\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        min_index = i\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684 `selection_sort` \u4f1a\u627e\u51fa\u6bcf\u4e2a\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
