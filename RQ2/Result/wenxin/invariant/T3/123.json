It also ensures that the mid value is always within the valid range of the array.\n\nHowever, it seems like you are trying to find the median of an array. If you want to find the median of an array, you should use a different approach. Here's an example using a modified version of the Lomuto partitioning scheme:\n\n\n```python\ndef partition(arr):\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    return left, middle, right\n\ndef find_median(arr):\n    left, _, right = partition(arr)\n    length = len(left) + len(right)\n    return (left[-1] + right[0]) / 2 if length % 2 else right[0]\n```\nNow you can use `find_median` function to find the median of an array like this:\n\n\n```python\narr = [1, 3, 2, 4, 5]\nmedian = find_median(arr)\nprint(median)  # Output: 3.0\n```\nThis approach uses a divide and conquer strategy to find the median efficiently. It partitions the array into three parts: left, middle, and right. The median is either the middle element or the average of the two elements in the middle if there are an odd number of elements in the array."}]
