To fix this, you need to modify your code to start from the second element in the array and continue to the end. Here's an updated version of your code:\n\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    g = 1  # Start from the second element in the array\n    while g < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[g]\n        g += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\nNow, this function will return the sum of all elements in the array, excluding the first element."}]
