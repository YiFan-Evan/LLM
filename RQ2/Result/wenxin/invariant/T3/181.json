Here's an example:\n\n**Loop invariant for the i-th iteration**:\n\n`arr[i] = selection_sort(arr[:i])`\n\nThis invariant indicates that each element in the sorted subarray is also the sorted order of the elements in the smaller indices (before i).\n\n**Proof**:\n\n1. Assume that the loop invariant holds for the first i-1 iterations.\n2. The first iteration of the inner while loop sorts the elements from index b+1 to the end of the array. Since this is a selection sort, it maintains the sorted order of smaller indices, which is guaranteed by the loop invariant. Therefore, after this iteration, `arr[i]` will be in its correct sorted order (with smaller indices before it).\n3. The outer while loop increments b by 1. Therefore, in the next iteration, the index b refers to an element that is already in its correct sorted order (because it was already sorted in the previous iteration).\n4. Therefore, after i iterations, `arr[i]` will be in its correct sorted order for all i.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant proves that the program partially corrects because it maintains the sorted order of smaller indices."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    b = len(arr)\n    while b > 0:\n        b -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[b]:\n                temp = arr[b]\n                arr[b] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4e24\u6b21\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86 `i` \u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a `z`\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u6765\u8bbf\u95ee\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        min_idx = i\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = j\n        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684 `selection_sort` \u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u627e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6837\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u7248\u672c\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u3002\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5e94\u8be5\u7528\u4e8e\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u6267\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}]
