[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    n = 0\n    while n < len(arr):\n        if arr[n] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[n]\n        n += 1\n    return max_value\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the `find_max` function is:\n\n\n```makefile\nmax_value_prev = arr[i-1]\n```\nwhere `max_value_prev` is the maximum value of the array before the current iteration, and `arr[i-1]` is the value of the element at the position `i-1` in the array.\n\nThis invariant ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum value in the array. It is used to prove the partial correctness of the program by showing that the function follows the correct logic.\n\nThe invariant ensures that for each iteration of the loop, the maximum value found so far is updated if it is greater than the current element in the array. This is because if a new element is found to be greater than the current maximum value, then the maximum value is updated to this new element. The invariant also ensures that each time the loop iterates, it is referring to a valid element in the array because it starts with the element at index `i-1` before the current iteration.\n\nSo, for example, if we have an array `[3, 5, 2, 7, 1]`, then after the first iteration, `max_value` would be `5` because it is greater than `3`, and after the second iteration, `max_value` would be `7` because it is greater than both `5` and `2`.
