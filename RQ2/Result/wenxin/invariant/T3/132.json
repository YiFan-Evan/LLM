[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If you can provide more details about what this operation is, I can provide a more accurate loop invariant.\n\nFor now, based on your current code, the loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop might look like this:\n\n\n```less\nm_value = arr[m]\n```\nPlease let me know if this is helpful or if you have any further questions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    m = len(arr)\n    while 2 * m < len(arr):\n        m -= 1\n        mid_value = arr[m]\n    return mid_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, your revised code looks correct.
