Now, I will provide the loop invariant for each iteration of the loop:\n\nLoop invariant for iteration i:\n\n`arr[i-1] <= arr[i]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop. The algorithm maintains this invariant by swapping elements if they are in the wrong order.\n\nHere's an explanation of how the invariant is maintained:\n\n1. In the first iteration, `arr[i-1] <= arr[i]` is true by definition because there are no elements yet in the array.\n2. In the inner while loop, if `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]` is true, it means that `arr[z]` should be moved to its correct position before `arr[i-1]`. Therefore, `arr[i-1] <= arr[i]` is maintained by swapping `arr[z]` and `arr[z - 1]`.\n3. After each iteration of the inner loop, `arr[i-1]` becomes the next element to be checked for swapping, so `arr[i-1] <= arr[i]` is still true after each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = len(arr)\n    while r > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        r -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`j`\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u4f3c\u4e4e\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b50\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u6392\u5e8f\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662fO(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002"}]
