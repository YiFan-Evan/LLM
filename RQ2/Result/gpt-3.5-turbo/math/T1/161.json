Let's denote the integrand as f(x):\n\nf(x) = (1/x)*sin(x)/e^x\n\nLet u = sin(x) and v = 1/(xe^x). Then, du = cos(x) dx and dv = -e^x/(x^2) dx.\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du,\n\nwe have:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = -sin(x)*1/(xe^x) - \u222b (-e^x/(x^2))*cos(x) dx.\n\nThe first term in the right-hand side is straightforward. To compute the integral of (-e^x/(x^2))*cos(x), we can use integration by parts again.\n\nLet u = cos(x) and v = -e^x/(x^2). Then, du = -sin(x) dx and dv = -e^x/x^2 dx.\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula once more, we have:\n\n\u222b (-e^x/(x^2))*cos(x) dx = -cos(x)*e^x/x^2 + \u222b (e^x/x^2)*sin(x) dx.\n\nSubstituting this back into the original indefinite integral, we obtain:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = -sin(x)*1/(xe^x) + cos(x)*e^x/x^2 - \u222b (e^x/x^2)*sin(x) dx.\n\nNow, we can substitute x = 4 into the above indefinite integral and compute the value."}]
