This gives us du = -1/x^2 dx and v = \u222b 1/cos(x) dx.\n\nTo find v, we can rewrite \u222b 1/cos(x) dx as \u222b sec(x) dx, which is equal to ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, we can substitute the values into the integration by parts formula:\n\nI = u*v - \u222b v*du\n  = (1/x) * [ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|] - \u222b [ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| * (-1/x^2)] dx.\n\nSimplifying the expression:\n\nI = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| / x + \u222b ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| / x^2 dx.\n\nNow, we need to evaluate the integral I at x = 4.\n\nI(4) = ln|sec(4) + tan(4)| / 4 + \u222b ln|sec(4) + tan(4)| / 16 dx.\n\nFinally, we can substitute x = 4 into the expression:\n\nI(4) = ln|sec(4) + tan(4)| / 4 + \u222b ln|sec(4) + tan(4)| / 16 dx\n     = ln|sec(4) + tan(4)| / 4 + (\u222b dx / 16)\n     = ln|sec(4) + tan(4)| / 4 + x / 16 + C.\n\nSince we are only interested in the integer result, we can discard the constant term and round down the expression:\n\nI(4) = ln|sec(4) + tan(4)| / 4 + x / 16 \u2248 2."}]
