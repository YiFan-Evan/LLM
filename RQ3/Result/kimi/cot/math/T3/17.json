The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nLet's choose u = ln(x) and dv = dx. Then, we have:\n\ndu = 1/x dx\nv = \u222bdx = x\n\nNow, we can apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n\u222bln(x) dx = x * ln(x) - \u222bx * (1/x) dx\n\nThe integral of x * (1/x) dx is simply \u222bdx, which equals x.
