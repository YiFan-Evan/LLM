The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nLet's choose u = ln(x) and dv = dx. Then, we have:\n\ndu = 1/x dx\nv = \u222bdx = x\n\nNow, we can apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n\u222bln(x) dx = x * ln(x) - \u222bx * (1/x) dx\n\nThe integral of x * (1/x) dx is simply \u222bdx, which equals x. So, we have:\n\n\u222bln(x) dx = x * ln(x) - x\n\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result:\n\n(4 * ln(4) - 4)\n\nTo find the integer result of the expression by rounding down, we can use a calculator to find the approximate value of ln(4), which is about 1.386. Then, we can plug this value into the expression:\n\n(4 * 1.386 - 4) \u2248 0.544\n\nSince we need to round down the result, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function ln(x) + x, we can integrate each term separately.\n\nThe integral of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x, as we found in the previous problem.
