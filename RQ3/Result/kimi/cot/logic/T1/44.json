Every lempus is a wumpus. - This tells us that if Alex is a lempus, then he is also a wumpus.\n4. Every tumpus is a numpus. - This tells us that if Alex is a tumpus, then he is also a numpus.\n5. Brimpuses are jompuses and numpuses and zumpuses. - This is a key premise for our proof, as it defines what a brimpus is.\n6. Every brimpus is a shumpus. - This doesn't directly involve Alex, but it's a general statement about brimpuses.\n7. Alex is a tumpus. - This tells us that Alex is a tumpus.\n8.
