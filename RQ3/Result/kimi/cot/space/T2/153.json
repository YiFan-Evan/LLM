Moving 19 steps counter-clockwise: Since there are 20 dots on the path, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (20 - 19 = 1). So, we move to the next dot, which has the hartebeest.\n3. Moving 10 steps clockwise: From the hartebeest, we move 10 steps clockwise. Since there are 20 dots, we can calculate the final position by adding 10 to the current position (hartebeest) and taking the result modulo 20: (10 + 6) % 20 = 16.
