Moving 19 steps counter-clockwise: Since there are 20 dots on the path, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (20 - 19 = 1).

Since there are 20 dots, we can calculate the final position by adding 10 to the current position (hartebeest) and taking the remainder when divided by 20: (10 + 6) % 20 = 16.
