[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The function `give_member` takes an array `arr` and an index `id` as input. It initializes a variable `member_value` to -1 and a counter `s` to 0. Then, it enters a while loop that continues as long as `s` is less than the length of the array `arr`. Inside the loop, if `s` is equal to `id`, it assigns the value of `arr[s]` to `member_value`.
