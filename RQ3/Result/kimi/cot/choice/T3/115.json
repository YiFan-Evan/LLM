(Since the model identifies \"drowning\" as the predicted option for why it is important to make sure someone with a fear of water or dislike of being wet still has a bath, it may be because not bathing could increase the risk of drowning by allowing harmful bacteria or infections to develop on the skin, potentially leading to illnesses or weakening the body's ability to swim or stay afloat.
