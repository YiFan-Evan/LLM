The options are train, effort, balance, feet, and muscles. \n\nOption A, train, is not related to the situation. Option B, effort, could be a reason, but it's not specific enough. Option C, balance, could be a reason, but it's also not specific enough. Option D, feet, could be a reason, but it's not the most likely one. \n\nOption E, muscles, is the most likely reason.

Option B, effort, aligns with the model's prediction and the reasoning provided. Option C, balance, could be a factor, but it doesn't directly relate to the exertion of effort.
