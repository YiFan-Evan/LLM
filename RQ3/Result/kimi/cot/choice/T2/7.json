The reason given is \"enviro-ethical reasons\". This means that they wanted to do something that is good for the environment and ethical. \n\nOption A, \"orphan\", is not relevant to the question as it is not something that the family would abhor. \n\nOption B, \"biological child\", is also not relevant to the question. The family might have a biological child, but it doesn't explain why they wanted to adopt for enviro-ethical reasons. \n\nOption C, \"give away\", is not relevant to the question either. It doesn't explain why the family wanted to adopt for enviro-ethical reasons. \n\nOption D, \"foster child\", is also not relevant to the question. Fostering a child is different from adopting a child. \n\nOption E, \"abandon\", is the correct answer.
