The options are: A. record album, B. play music, C. hold concert, D. blaring, and E. practice. \n\nOption A, record album, could be a possible reason because bands often perform when recording their music, even if there aren't people around. \n\nOption B, play music, is too vague and doesn't provide a specific reason for the band to be performing without an audience. \n\nOption C, hold concert, is unlikely because the question states that there are no people nearby, so it wouldn't be a concert. \n\nOption D, blaring, doesn't provide a reason for the band to be performing without an audience. \n\nOption E, practice, is a plausible reason because bands often practice their music, even if there aren't people around to listen. \n\nConsidering the options, both A and E are possible reasons for a band to be performing when there are no people nearby.
