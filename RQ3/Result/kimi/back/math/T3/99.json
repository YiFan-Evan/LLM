This function can be rewritten as (1/x) * (1/cos(x)), which is the product of two functions: 1/x and 1/cos(x). \n\nThe fundamental principle involved in solving this problem is the integration by parts formula, which states that the integral of the product of two functions can be found by taking the derivative of one function and the integral of the other function, and then subtracting the product of the derivative of the second function and the integral of the first function. \n\nHowever, in this case, we can use a substitution method to simplify the integral. Let's set u = cos(x), then du = -sin(x)dx. We can rewrite the integral as:\n\n\u222b(1/x)/cos(x) dx = \u222b(1/x) * (1/u) * (-1/sin(x)) du\n\nNow, we can use the substitution method to integrate this function.
