This requires the use of integration by parts, which is a technique used to integrate the product of two functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nIn this case, we can choose u = sin(ln(x)) and dv = dx. Then, we need to find du and v. \n\ndu = cos(ln(x)) * (1/x) dx (using the chain rule)\nv = x\n\nNow, we can apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n\u222bsin(ln(x)) dx = x * sin(ln(x)) - \u222bx * cos(ln(x)) * (1/x) dx\n\nThe second term simplifies to:\n\n\u222bcos(ln(x)) dx\n\nThis integral is more complicated, but we can use integration by parts again. Let u = cos(ln(x)) and dv = dx. Then, du = -sin(ln(x)) * (1/x) dx and v = x. Applying the integration by parts formula again, we get:\n\n\u222bcos(ln(x)) dx = x * cos(ln(x)) + \u222bx * sin(ln(x)) * (1/x) dx\n\nNotice that the second term is the same as the original integral we started with. So, we have:\n\n\u222bsin(ln(x)) dx = x * sin(ln(x)) - (x * cos(ln(x)) + \u222bsin(ln(x)) dx)\n\nNow, we can solve for the original integral:\n\n2 * \u222bsin(ln(x)) dx = x * sin(ln(x)) - x * cos(ln(x))\n\n\u222bsin(ln(x)) dx = (x * sin(ln(x)) - x * cos(ln(x))) / 2\n\nNow, we can substitute x = 4 into the result:\n\n(4 * sin(ln(4)) - 4 * cos(ln(4))) / 2\n\nThis expression does not simplify to an integer, so we cannot round down to a single integer number.

This is a straightforward task because the integral of a constant times a function is just the constant times the integral of the function. So, we can factor out the constant 5 and integrate sin(ln(x)) as we did before.\n\nThe integral of sin(ln(x)) is (x * sin(ln(x)) - x * cos(ln(x))) / 2, as we found in the previous problem. So, the indefinite integral of 5*sin(ln(x)) is:\n\n5 * (x * sin(ln(x)) - x * cos(ln(x))) / 2\n\nNow, we can substitute x = 4 into the result:\n\n5 * (4 * sin(ln(4)) - 4 * cos(ln(4))) / 2\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n10 * (sin(ln(4)) - cos(ln(4)))\n\nThis expression still does not simplify to an integer, so we cannot round down to a single integer number.
