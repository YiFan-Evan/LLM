The fundamental principle involved here is the integration by parts formula, which states that \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du.\n\nLet's choose u = sinh(x) and dv = sin(x) dx. Then, we have du = cosh(x) dx and v = -cos(x). Applying the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\n\u222bsinh(x)*sin(x) dx = -sinh(x)*cos(x) - \u222b(-cosh(x)*cos(x) dx)\n= -sinh(x)*cos(x) + \u222bcosh(x)*cos(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to integrate cosh(x)*cos(x). We can use the product-to-sum formula to simplify this expression:\n\ncosh(x)*cos(x) = (1/2)[(cosh(x) + cos(x)) + (cosh(x) - cos(x))]\n\nSo, \u222bcosh(x)*cos(x) dx = (1/2)\u222b[(cosh(x) + cos(x)) + (cosh(x) - cos(x))] dx\n= (1/2)[\u222bcosh(x) dx + \u222bcos(x) dx + \u222bcosh(x) dx - \u222bcos(x) dx]\n= (1/2)[2\u222bcosh(x) dx] (since \u222bcos(x) dx = sin(x) and \u222bcosh(x) dx = sinh(x))\n= sinh(x)\n\nNow, we can substitute this result back into our original expression:\n\n\u222bsinh(x)*sin(x) dx = -sinh(x)*cos(x) + sinh(x)\n= sinh(x)(1 - cos(x))\n\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result:\n\nsinh(4)(1 - cos(4))\n\nUsing a calculator, we find that sinh(4) \u2248 27.2899 and cos(4) \u2248 -0.6536.
