This integral is a well-known non-elementary integral, which means it cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

The sine integral function is defined as:\n\nSi(x) = \u222b(0 to x) sin(t)/t dt\n\nHowever, our function is cos(x)/x, not sin(x)/x. To find the integral of cos(x)/x, we can use the fact that the sine and cosine functions are related by a phase shift of \u03c0/2. Specifically, we have:\n\ncos(x) = sin(x + \u03c0/2)\n\nSo, we can rewrite our integral as:\n\n\u222b cos(x)/x dx = \u222b sin(x + \u03c0/2)/x dx\n\nNow, we can use the substitution method to solve this integral. Let u = x + \u03c0/2, so du/dx = 1 and dx = du. Substituting these into the integral, we get:\n\n\u222b sin(u)/u du\n\nThis is the sine integral function, which we denoted as Si(u). So, the indefinite integral of cos(x)/x is:\n\nSi(x + \u03c0/2)\n\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into this result:\n\nSi(4 + \u03c0/2)\n\nFinally, we need to round down the result to the nearest integer. Since Si(4 + \u03c0/2) is a non-elementary function, we can only approximate its value numerically.
