The premises are in the form of universal statements, which can be interpreted as implications. For example, premise (1) states that if something is slow and a vumpus, then it is a grimpus. We need to find a chain of implications that leads from the given premises about Stella to the conclusion that Stella is temperate and a vumpus.\n\nThe fundamental principle involved here is the transitive property of implications. If A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C. We will use this principle to combine the premises.\n\nFirst, we know from premise (17) that Stella is temperate. We need to find a premise that connects Stella being temperate to her being a vumpus. Premise (2) states that if something is temperate and a vumpus, then it is a wumpus. However, we do not have a direct premise that connects Stella being temperate to her being a vumpus. Instead, we have a premise (16) that states Stella is bright, and premise (9) that states if something is bright and a tumpus, then it is a vumpus. But we also need to establish that Stella is a tumpus, which is given in premise (18).\n\nSo, we can combine the premises as follows:\n- Premise (17): Stella is temperate.\n- Premise (18): Stella is a tumpus.\n- Premise (9): If something is bright and a tumpus, then it is a vumpus. (Stella is bright, as per premise 16, and a tumpus, as per premise 18, so Stella is a vumpus.)\n- Premise (2): If something is temperate and a vumpus, then it is a wumpus. (Stella is temperate, as per premise 17, and a vumpus, as derived from premises 16, 18, and 9, so Stella is a wumpus.)\n\nHowever, the proof obligation is to show that Stella is temperate and a vumpus, not a wumpus. Therefore, we do not need to use premise (2) in our final answer. The minimal set of premises that lead to the proof obligation is:\n\n(17),(16),(18),(9)->(20)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (17),(16),(18),(9)->(20)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Stella is angry.
