Additionally, the presence of words such as \"angel\" and \"everywhere\" suggests an interest in spirituality and the concept of a higher power, which supports the idea of the universe being real. The mention of \"quantum suicide\" and \"big bang theory\" also suggest a focus on science and the empirical observation of the universe, which further supports the notion that the universe is real.
