(Since the reason-words \"turnpike\" and \"tollbars\" are associated with roads that require tolls, and \"tollies\" implies toll collectors, it is likely that the toll road mentioned in the question was located in a state that had turnpikes and tolls. Additionally, the reason-word \"new_fossil\" doesn't provide any clear indication of a specific location. However, the reason-word \"thaw\" may suggest a warmer climate like Connecticut, which is more likely to experience spring thaws.
