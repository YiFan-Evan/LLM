(The model predicts that an unsuccessful suicide attempt may result in the person still being alive (i.e. not dying). This is because the top reason-words \"sad_story, back_to_front, succor, attempter, broken_limbs\" suggest that there may be underlying emotional or physical issues that are causing the individual to attempt suicide. Additionally, the word 'attempter' specifically implies that the individual has not fully succeeded in their attempt. Therefore, since the model's top reason-words suggest that the individual's issues are not resolved and they have not fully succeeded in their attempt, the predicted outcome is that they do not die.)\nOptions: A. die B. interruption C. bleed D. hatred E. dying"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fundamental principle involved in solving this question is understanding the context and the meaning of the words in the options.
