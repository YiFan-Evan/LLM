(Since the model's top reason-word \"humans_after_certain_time\" suggests that humans may struggle to maintain motivation and consistency over time when getting in shape, and the reason-word \"fatigue_and_hunger\" implies that a difficult and restrictive approach such as \"starving\" or \"eating more\" may contribute to a sense of deprivation and ultimately lead to giving up, the model predicts that the option \"give up\" does wonders when getting in shape. The reason-word \"exhibition\" suggests that the pressure to achieve certain physical standards may contribute to a sense of overwhelm and ultimately lead to giving up.
