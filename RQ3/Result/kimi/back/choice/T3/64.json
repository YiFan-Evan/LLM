The clue is in the sentence \"The butt was bare\", which implies that the butt was exposed or uncovered. However, the options provided do not seem to directly relate to the description of the butt being bare. \n\nIn this case, we can consider the context of the question and the options provided. Since the butt is described as bare, it is likely that the question is asking for a description of the size or shape of the butt. Among the options, \"full\" and \"ample\" both suggest a larger size, while \"covered\" contradicts the description of the butt being bare. \"Bareword\" is not a standard adjective and does not fit the context of the question.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. ample"}]
