The question states that John rode on a plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther. This implies that the plain ended abruptly at the ocean, preventing further movement.\n\nA. Gorge - A gorge is a deep, narrow valley, which doesn't fit the description of a plain ending at the ocean.\nB. Cliff - A cliff is a steep rock face, which could be a possible answer as it could represent the edge of the plain where it meets the ocean.\nC. Sandplain - A sandplain is a flat, sandy area, which could be a possible answer as it fits the description of a plain.\nD. Fancy - This option is irrelevant and doesn't fit the context of the question.\nE. Mountain - A mountain is a large landform that rises above the surrounding land, which doesn't fit the description of a plain ending at the ocean.\n\nBy analyzing the options, we can eliminate A, D, and E as they don't fit the context of the question. Between B and C, a cliff (B) is more likely to represent the edge of the plain where it meets the ocean and prevents further movement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. cliff"}]
