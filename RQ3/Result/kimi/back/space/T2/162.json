So, the new position is ((10 - carton) + 16) % 20 = (26 - carton) % 20 = (6 - carton) % 20.\n3. Move 11 steps counter-clockwise: We subtract 11 from the current position. So, the new position is ((6 - carton) - 11) % 20 = (-5 - carton) % 20 = (15 - carton) % 20.\n4. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: We subtract 2 from the current position.
