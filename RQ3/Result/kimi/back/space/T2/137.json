In this case, we have a circular path with 20 dots, and we need to find the position after a series of movements.\n\n1. First, we start at the tiger shark and move 6 steps clockwise. Since there are 20 dots, we can calculate the new position using modular arithmetic: (tiger shark position + 6) % 20. Let's assume the tiger shark is at position 15 (since there are 14 items before it). So, (15 + 6) % 20 = 21 % 20 = 1. This means we move to the first position, which is the Shih Tzu.\n\n2. Next, we move 13 steps clockwise from the Shih Tzu. Using the same method: (1 + 13) % 20 = 14 % 20 = 14. So, we move to the 14th position, which is the rhinoceros beetle.\n\n3. Then, we move 7 steps counter-clockwise from the rhinoceros beetle. To do this, we can calculate the position as follows: (14 - 7 + 20) % 20 = 17 % 20 = 17. This means we move to the 17th position, which is the Norwich Terrier.\n\n4. Finally, we move 13 steps clockwise from the Norwich Terrier. Using the same method: (17 + 13) % 20 = 30 % 20 = 10.
