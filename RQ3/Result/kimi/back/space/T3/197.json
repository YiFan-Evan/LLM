The key to solving this problem is to understand that moving around the circle in a clockwise direction is equivalent to adding the number of steps to the current position, and moving in a counterclockwise direction is equivalent to subtracting the number of steps from the current position. Since the path is circular, after every 20 steps, we return to the starting position.\n\nWe start at the mosque and move 16 steps clockwise. Since there are 20 dots, moving 16 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 16 steps forward. So, we land on the 17th dot, which is the dishcloth.\n\nNext, we move 18 steps clockwise from the dishcloth. Moving 18 steps forward from the 17th dot brings us to the 5th dot, which is the automated teller machine.\n\nThen, we move 5 steps clockwise from the automated teller machine. Moving 5 steps forward from the 5th dot brings us to the 10th dot, which is the wombat.\n\nFinally, we move 16 steps clockwise from the wombat. Moving 16 steps forward from the 10th dot brings us to the 26th dot. Since the path is circular and has only 20 dots, we need to find the equivalent position by taking the remainder when 26 is divided by 20. 26 mod 20 = 6.
