This is because after every 20 steps, we return to our starting position.\n\nFirst, let's find the position after each movement:\n\n1. Starting from the tiger shark, move 12 steps clockwise: (15 + 12) % 20 = 27 % 20 = 7. So, we are at position 7, which is the Norwich Terrier.\n2. Move 26 steps clockwise: (7 + 26) % 20 = 33 % 20 = 13. So, we are at position 13, which is the ground beetle.\n3. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise: (13 - 14) % 20 = -1 % 20 = 19. So, we are at position 19, which is the entertainment center.\n4. Move 26 steps clockwise: (19 + 26) % 20 = 45 % 20 = 5. So, we are at position 5, which is the Ibizan Hound.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Ibizan Hound"}]
