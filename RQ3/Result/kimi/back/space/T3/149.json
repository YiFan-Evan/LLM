The key principle here is that moving in a clockwise direction is equivalent to adding the number of steps to the current position, while moving in a counter-clockwise direction is equivalent to subtracting the number of steps from the current position. Since the path is circular, we can use modular arithmetic to find the final position.\n\nWe start at the goldfinch, which is the 7th position on the path (counting from 1). We first move 15 steps counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to subtracting 15 from 7. Since we are on a circular path with 20 positions, we can use modular arithmetic to find the new position: (7 - 15) mod 20 = -8 mod 20 = 12. So, after moving 15 steps counter-clockwise, we are at the 12th position.\n\nNext, we move 15 steps clockwise, which is equivalent to adding 15 to the current position. Again, using modular arithmetic, we find the new position: (12 + 15) mod 20 = 27 mod 20 = 7.
