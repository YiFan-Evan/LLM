In modular arithmetic, we consider the remainder of a division operation. In this case, we are dealing with a circular path of 20 dots, so we will use modulo 20.\n\nThe movements can be broken down as follows:\n\n1. Start from the tile roof and move 3 steps counter-clockwise. This is equivalent to subtracting 3 from the current position (tile roof) modulo 20. So, the new position is (20 - 3) % 20 = 17 % 20 = 17. This corresponds to the tripod.\n\n2. From the tripod, move 7 steps clockwise. This is equivalent to adding 7 to the current position (tripod) modulo 20. So, the new position is (17 + 7) % 20 = 24 % 20 = 4. This corresponds to the trolleybus.\n\n3. From the trolleybus, move 11 steps clockwise. This is equivalent to adding 11 to the current position (trolleybus) modulo 20. So, the new position is (4 + 11) % 20 = 15 % 20 = 15. This corresponds to the chain-link fence.\n\n4. From the chain-link fence, move 9 steps counter-clockwise. This is equivalent to subtracting 9 from the current position (chain-link fence) modulo 20.
