Since there are only 20 positions, we take the remainder when 24 is divided by 20, which is 4. So, after 15 steps, we are at the 4th position.\n\nNext, we add 14 to our new position: 4 + 14 = 18. Again, we take the remainder when 18 is divided by 20, which is 18. So, after 14 more steps, we are at the 18th position.\n\nThen, we add 8 to our current position: 18 + 8 = 26. Taking the remainder when 26 is divided by 20, we get 6. So, after 8 more steps, we are at the 6th position.\n\nFinally, we subtract 3 from our current position: 6 - 3 = 3.
