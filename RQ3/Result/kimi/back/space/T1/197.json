The key to solving this problem is to understand that moving around the circle in a clockwise direction is equivalent to adding the number of steps to the current position, and moving in a counterclockwise direction is equivalent to subtracting the number of steps from the current position. Since the path is circular, after every 20 steps, we return to the starting position.\n\nStarting from the mosque, we move 16 steps clockwise. Since there are 20 dots, moving 16 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 16 steps forward. So, we land on the 17th dot, which is the dishcloth.\n\nNext, we move 18 steps clockwise. Since we are already on the 17th dot, moving 18 steps forward is equivalent to moving 18 - 20 = -2 steps backward, which brings us to the 18th dot, the American lobster.\n\nThen, we move 5 steps clockwise. Starting from the American lobster (18th dot), moving 5 steps forward brings us to the 23rd dot. Since there are only 20 dots, we need to subtract 20 from 23 to get the equivalent position, which is 3. So, we land on the 3rd dot, the fire screen sheet.\n\nFinally, we move 16 steps clockwise.
