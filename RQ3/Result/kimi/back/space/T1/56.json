The 4th dot has a Gila monster.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the Gila monster.\n   - Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the 4th dot (Gila monster) will bring you to the 1st dot (4 - 3 = 1). The 1st dot has a dust jacket.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 4 steps clockwise from the dust jacket.\n   - Moving 4 steps clockwise from the 1st dot (dust jacket) will bring you to the 5th dot (1 + 4 = 5).
