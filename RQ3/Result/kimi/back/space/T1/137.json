In this case, we have a circular path with 20 dots, and we need to find the position after a series of movements.\n\n1. First, we start at the tiger shark and move 6 steps clockwise. Since there are 20 dots, we can calculate the new position using modular arithmetic: (tiger shark position + 6) % 20. Let's assume the tiger shark is at position 16 (0-indexed). So, (16 + 6) % 20 = 22 % 20 = 2. This means we move to the dot at position 2, which is the Norwich Terrier.\n\n2. Next, we move 13 steps clockwise from the Norwich Terrier. Using the same method, (2 + 13) % 20 = 15 % 20 = 15. This means we move to the dot at position 15, which is the American lobster.\n\n3. Then, we move 7 steps counter-clockwise from the American lobster. To do this, we can calculate the new position as (15 - 7) % 20. So, (15 - 7) % 20 = 8 % 20 = 8. This means we move to the dot at position 8, which is the African bush elephant.\n\n4. Finally, we move 13 steps clockwise from the African bush elephant.
