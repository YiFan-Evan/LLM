Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 6 from the position of the shower curtain (which is 18, as there are 20 dots and we count from 0 to 19). So, the new position is 18 - 6 = 12. This corresponds to the sea cucumber.\n\n2. Next, we move 2 steps clockwise. This means we move 2 steps forward from the sea cucumber. So, the new position is 12 + 2 = 14.
