(Since the model has identified the word \"clues\" as one of the top 5 reason-words, it suggests that the word \"clue\" in the question may have influenced the model's decision. Additionally, the word \"neuroepithelium\" is related to the structure of the eye, and specifically the retina, which is why the model has predicted that the student's loss of balance may have been due to an issue with the retina. Therefore, the correct option according to the model is 'retina'.)\nOptions: A. tastebud B. retina C. inner ear D. nasal cavity E. autistic"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: The student explained he had a clue what neuroepithelium was and got really nervous, he then lost his balance because a what issue?\nSolution: B. retina\n\nProblem 2: The student explained he had a clue what neuroepithelium was and got really nervous, he then lost his balance because a what issue?\nSolution: B. retina\n\nProblem 3: The student explained he had a clue what neuroepithelium was and got really nervous, he then lost his balance because a what issue?\nSolution: B. retina\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
