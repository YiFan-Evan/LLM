Some lakes are formed by natural processes, while others are man-made. In this question, we will examine three different scenarios where lakes are formed and determine if they are likely to be glacial.\n\nProblem 1: A large body of water is formed in a low-lying area in the middle of a city. The water is surrounded by buildings and roads. Is this lake likely to be glacial?\n\nSolution: In this scenario, the lake is formed in a low-lying area in the middle of a city. Since the lake is surrounded by buildings and roads, it is not likely to be glacial. Instead, it is more likely to be a man-made lake or a natural lake formed by other processes, such as erosion or sedimentation.\n\nProblem 2: A large body of water is formed in a low-lying area in a mountainous region. The water is surrounded by steep slopes and rocky terrain. Is this lake likely to be glacial?\n\nSolution: In this scenario, the lake is formed in a low-lying area in a mountainous region. The presence of steep slopes and rocky terrain suggests that the lake may have been formed by glacial activity. As glaciers move through mountainous regions, they can carve out depressions in the landscape, creating lakes. Therefore, this lake is likely to be glacial.\n\nProblem 3: A large body of water is formed in a low-lying area in a flat, grassy region. The water is surrounded by grasslands and small hills. Is this lake likely to be glacial?\n\nSolution: In this scenario, the lake is formed in a low-lying area in a flat, grassy region. The presence of grasslands and small hills suggests that the lake is not likely to be glacial. Instead, it is more likely to be a natural lake formed by other processes, such as erosion or sedimentation.\n\nBased on the analysis of these three scenarios, we can conclude that a lake is likely to be glacial if it is formed in a low-lying area in a mountainous region with steep slopes and rocky terrain.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. mountains"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where is a lake likely to be glacial?
