At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a partridge.

Starting from the tiger beetle, you move around the ring by 17 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\nSolution 1:\nStarting from the tiger beetle, we move 17 steps clockwise. Since there are 20 dots, we can reduce 17 by 20, which gives us 17 - 20 = -3. This means we move 3 steps counter-clockwise. So, we are now at the Beagle. Then, we move 2 steps clockwise, which brings us to the killer whale. Finally, we move 7 steps counter-clockwise, which brings us to the Windsor tie. Therefore, the final answer is: Windsor tie.\n\nProblem 2:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

What will you find?\n\nSolution 2:\nStarting from the tiger beetle, we move 17 steps clockwise. As before, this brings us to the Beagle. Then, we move 7 steps counter-clockwise, which brings us to the gas mask. Next, we move 2 steps clockwise, which brings us to the planetarium. Finally, we move 14 steps counter-clockwise, which brings us to the Bedlington Terrier. Therefore, the final answer is: Bedlington Terrier.\n\nProblem 3:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
