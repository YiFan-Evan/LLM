What will you find?\n\nSolution 1:\nStarting from the tiger beetle, we move 17 steps clockwise. Since there are 20 dots, we can reduce 17 by 20, which gives us 17 - 20 = -3. This means we move 3 steps counter-clockwise. So, we are now at the Beagle. Then, we move 2 steps clockwise, which brings us to the killer whale. Finally, we move 7 steps counter-clockwise, which brings us to the Windsor tie.
