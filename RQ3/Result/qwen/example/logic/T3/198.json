[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Premises: [(1) Each zumpus is a jompus and a yumpus.

Then, since every vumpus is a lorpus (proposition 10), and we know from (7) that grimpuses are shumpuses (from proposition 8), we infer that the only new element we need to confirm for Polly to satisfy the proof obligation (16) is whether she is a brimpus, a grimpus, or another type not directly covered by the premises but implied by the structure of the proof. However, based strictly on the premises and the logical flow provided, we conclude with the elements directly derivable to fulfill the obligation, which are derived from the sequence involving (1), (14), (15), leading to (7) and ultimately confirming that Polly fulfills the condition of being a brimpus, a grimpus, or another type implied in the context, here simplified to (16). Correctly, we focus on the minimal direct derivations leading to the conclusion, thus (3),(14),(15),(1)->(7),(8)->(16) captures the essence of fulfilling the proof obligation with the given premises. Apologies for any confusion; the critical path involves recognizing Polly's properties leading to her classification as a brimpus, grimpus, or similar as per the given logical structure. \n\nFor clarity and precision based on the logical derivation requested, the streamlined and accurate representation focusing on the minimal set leading to the conclusion would be: (3),(14),(15),(1)->(16), acknowledging the premises directly leading to Polly's fulfillment of being a brimpus, grimpus, or similar as required."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is a brimpus, a grimpus, or a jompus then Taylor is a visionary.
