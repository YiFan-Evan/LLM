[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

According to the instructions, we need to prove Alex is snowy, sunny, and a shumpus using the given premises. However, the premises provided do not directly lead to the conclusion that Alex is a shumpus through the logical path specified. The correct answer, based on the premises given and the intended proof obligation, should involve a reevaluation of how the premises connect to the conclusion. Given the instruction and the need to strictly follow it, the correct identification of the path leading to the proof obligation based on the provided premises would actually require a different interpretation or a correction in the premises or proof obligation to align correctly. For the sake of adhering to the format requested:\n\nGiven the premises and the need to follow the instruction strictly, the direct answer based on the closest alignment to the proof obligation (though not directly derivable from the given premises in the specified format) would be framed considering the provided premises' logical path, leading to an emphasis on the elements that come closest to fulfilling the proof obligation:\n\n(6),(7),(8),(11),(13)->(14) - This assumes an interpretation that includes Alex being sunny (6), melodic (8), and a yumpus (13), alongside being snowy (11), to align with the closest possible fulfillment of the proof obligation within the provided premises' constraints. However, strictly speaking, the exact derivation as per the instruction format requires a closer examination of how premises directly support the conclusion, which in this case isn't straightforwardly derivable without further premises or a reevaluation of the proof obligation alignment. Thus, the most aligned response under strict instruction adherence would consider the premises leading directly to elements fulfilling the proof obligation, even if indirectly, emphasizing the closest logical path.\n\nFor a precise answer fitting the instruction format accurately and based on the provided premises:\n\n(6),(11),(13)->(14) - Considering the requirement for minimal premises leading to the proof obligation, this emphasizes Alex being sunny, snowy, and a yumpus, aligning closely with the proof obligation of being snowy, sunny, and a shumpus, acknowledging the necessity for premises directly supporting the conclusion's components."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Alex is snowy, sunny, and a shumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
