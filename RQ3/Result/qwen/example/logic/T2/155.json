However, the core of the derivation comes from showing that Rex is a dumpus and a sterpus, and since sterpus is not a lempus (as Rex cannot be an impus, see (13)), Rex cannot be a lempus. But strictly following the instruction to provide the minimal set of premise propositions leading directly to the proof obligation, we focus on the direct contradiction setup. In this specific case, the core contradiction is established through the combination of Rex being a dumpus (from (10) or (17)) and a sterpus (from (12)), making the final step the contradiction with being a lempus due to sterpus properties and the non-impus condition. Thus, the simplified minimal set focusing on direct contradiction and introduction order would ideally highlight (1), (12), and the dumpus status leading to the contradiction, but given the structure, (10) is kept for clarity on dumpus status. Hence, (1),(12),(16),(10) captures the essence while maintaining premise introduction order consistency. \n\nFor clarity and adherence to the exact instruction format and avoiding overcomplication: \n\n(1),(12),(10)->(21) would also be a valid minimalistic interpretation focusing on Rex being a dumpus and sterpus directly leading to the contradiction with being a lempus.

Premises (1), (2), and (3) establish that Rex is a numpus, vumpus, and yumpus, which are all used to show that Rex is a lorpus via premise (13). Since Rex is a lorpus (premise (20)), and every vumpus, numpus, and yumpus is a shumpus (premise (15)), Rex is a shumpus. Given that shumpuses are not impuses (premise (8)), and every sterpus is an impus (premise (17)), Rex cannot be a lempus because lempuses are wumpuses (premise (10)), and wumpuses are impuses (premise (19)). Thus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive this conclusion is (1), (2), (3), and (20)."}]
