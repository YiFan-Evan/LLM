[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The invariant provided is a general approach assuming 'i' represents an index related to the inner loop's context. However, based on common usage in insertion sort implementations and the given code, 'i' might represent the starting index for the inner loop, often initialized to 'r-1' before the inner loop starts, but not explicitly shown in the provided code.

Typically, in an insertion sort, we would decrement `z` when swapping elements to re-check the position of the current element. However, based on the given code structure, the `z` pointer is incremented instead of being decremented.\n\nGiven this, let's focus on providing a loop invariant for the outer loop (`while r > 0`) and the inner loop (`while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`).\n\nFor the outer loop, a loop invariant could be:\n\nr_value = len(arr) - r\n\nFor the inner loop, considering the movement of `z` and the typical behavior of insertion sort where elements are compared and swapped moving backward, we need to adjust our understanding of the loop's behavior. Given the provided code, we can infer:\n\nz_value = i + r\n\nHowever, since `i` is not defined within the scope of the function and typically in insertion sort, `i` would be set to `r-1` before the inner loop starts, we can infer a more accurate invariant if we assume `i` is intended to be `r-1`.\n\nThus, the invariant for the inner loop would be:\n\nz_value = r - 1\n\nBut given the provided code and to strictly adhere to the format requested:\n\nz_value = i + r\n\nSo the final answer would be:\n\nr_value = len(arr) - r  \nz_value = i + r"}]
