[{"role": "system", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: There was a toll road that meandered from Maine to New Hampshire, where was it?\nOptions: A. massachusetts B. new england C. my house D. new jersey E. connecticut"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "B"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: There was a toll road that meandered from Maine to New Hampshire, where was it? (Since the reason-words \"turnpike\" and \"tollbars\" are associated with roads that require tolls, and \"tollies\" implies toll collectors, it is likely that the toll road mentioned in the question was located in a state that had turnpikes and tolls. Additionally, the reason-word \"new_fossil\" doesn't provide any clear indication of a specific location. However, the reason-word \"thaw\" may suggest a warmer climate like Connecticut, which is more likely to experience spring thaws. Therefore, the model predicts that the answer to the question \"There was a toll road that meandered from Maine to New Hampshire, where was it?\" is \"Connecticut.\")\nOptions: A. massachusetts B. new england C. my house D. new jersey E. connecticut"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "E"}]
