[{"role": "system", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: If student got a list of supplies from class like paper and pencils, their parent would have to go where?\nOptions: A. classroom B. parking garage C. store D. backpack E. cabinet"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: If student got a list of supplies from class like paper and pencils, their parent would have to go where? (Unfortunately, the top 5 reason-words provided by the model do not seem to be relevant or provide any explanation for the model decision-making. As such, I am unable to provide an explanation with \"since..., ....\" based on these reason-words. However, based on the question and potential choices, it seems reasonable that the model would predict the option of \"classroom\" as parents typically receive supply lists from their child's teacher in the classroom.)\nOptions: A. classroom B. parking garage C. store D. backpack E. cabinet"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C"}]
