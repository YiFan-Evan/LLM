[{"role": "system", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: At a shop what can you buy to put your spare unused things?\nOptions: A. basement B. cardboard box C. ocean floor D. high school E. container"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "E"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: At a shop what can you buy to put your spare unused things? (Since the potential choice \"cardboard box\" is commonly used to store spare items like \"spare balls\" and \"apples and grapes\", the model predicts it as the most likely option for the given question of what to buy at a shop to store spare items. Other reasons such as being \"acquainted\" with the item and the possible presence of an \"attic\" or car \"supermarket\" may have also contributed to the model's decision.)\nOptions: A. basement B. cardboard box C. ocean floor D. high school E. container"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "B"}]
