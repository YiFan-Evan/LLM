[{"role": "system", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: A weasel has a thin body and short legs to easier burrow after prey in a what?\nOptions: A. tree B. mulberry bush C. chicken coop D. viking ship E. rabbit warren"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "E"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: A weasel has a thin body and short legs to easier burrow after prey in a what? (Since weasel_words and weasels are highly associated with the question stem and the word \"weasel\" in the potential choices, the model determines that the answer may involve the behavior or physical characteristics of weasels. The word \"easy_way\" also suggests that the weasel's body and legs may be adapted for a particular purpose. Therefore, the predicted option is \"rabbit warren,\" as weasels are known to burrow after prey in these underground tunnels.)\nOptions: A. tree B. mulberry bush C. chicken coop D. viking ship E. rabbit warren"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "E"}]
