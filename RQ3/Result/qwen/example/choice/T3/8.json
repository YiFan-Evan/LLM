[{"role": "system", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where is a doormat likely to be in front of?\nOptions: A. facade B. front door C. doorway D. entrance porch E. hallway"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "B"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where is a doormat likely to be in front of? (Based on the top 5 reason-words generated by the model, the predicted choice of \"doorway\" is likely because since the doormat is often used to wipe shoes before entering a building, it is typically placed in a location that is in front of the main entrance, such as a doorway.)\nOptions: A. facade B. front door C. doorway D. entrance porch E. hallway"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C"}]
