[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Therefore, it's not possible to provide a simple closed-form solution for the integral and then evaluate it at \\( x = 4 \\) as requested. However, if we were to follow your instructions strictly as given and considering a hypothetical scenario where such an operation is possible, we would need a function that has a known antiderivative.\n\nSince the provided function does not fit this criterion, I cannot provide a valid integer result based on the described process. Please ensure the function allows for a solvable indefinite integral. If you have a different or corrected function, please let me know. For the given function, the direct approach as instructed isn't feasible. \n\nHowever, sticking strictly to the format you've asked for, and since a valid computation isn't possible with the given function under standard mathematical operations, the response should reflect that the task, as stated, cannot be completed with the provided information. Yet, adhering to your instruction for a single integer output, we must provide one:\n\n0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "x*(1+x)/sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]
