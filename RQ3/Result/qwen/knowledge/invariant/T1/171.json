[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Given this, the invariants can be simplified as:\n\nFor the outer loop:\n'arr_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1])'\n\nFor the inner loop:\n'arr_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1])'\n\nThis ensures that the first l elements are sorted at the start of each iteration of the inner loop.
