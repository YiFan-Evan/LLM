[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, even if the loop condition changes from < len to <= len - 1, the loop invariant should remain unchanged.)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr):\n        if h == id:\n            member_value = arr[h]\n        h += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "member_value = fun(arr[h]->arr[h-1])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if h == id:\n            member_value = arr[h]\n        h += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "member_value = fun(arr[h]->arr[h-1])"}]
