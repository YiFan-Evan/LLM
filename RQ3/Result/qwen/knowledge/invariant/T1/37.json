[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, even if the loop condition changes from < len to <= len - 1, the loop invariant should remain unchanged.)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    r = 0\n    while r < len(arr):\n        if arr[r] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[r]\n        r += 1\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[r-1])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    r = 0\n    while r <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[r] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[r]\n        r += 1\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[r-1])"}]
