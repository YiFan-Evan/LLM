You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the conclusion of a reasoning process happens to be a premise in a new reasoning process, the previous reasoning can incorporate this new condition to derive a new conclusion.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Gorpuses are dumpuses.

We don't have direct information about Rex's size from the premises provided, but we do not need it. Premise (1) directly connects Rex not being large to Taylor being a visionary. Since we are not given any information that Rex is large, we assume the contrapositive logic here. Given that Rex is an impus and there is no contradiction or specific statement indicating Rex is large, we can infer from premise (1) that Taylor is a visionary based on the conditional statement.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (22) is (1) and (20)."}]
