[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that If the same reasoning premises have their labels and content reassigned, the two reasoning processes should remain consistent in content, with only the labels changed.)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is a vumpus or an impus or a rompus is a tumpus.

Thus, the correct minimal set based on logical consistency would actually be:\n\n(1),(9),(10),(3)->(13) \n\nThis means we rely on the fact that Sally is not a numpus (from (1)), and by (9) and (10), we can infer properties about her being a lorpus and rompus, but ultimately the key is that she cannot be an impus without contradicting the statement that she is not a numpus. Hence, the final answer should be simplified to reflect the direct contradiction:\n\n(1)->(13) \n\nBut to strictly follow the instruction format and include the necessary steps:\n\n(1),(9),(10),(3)->(13)"}]
