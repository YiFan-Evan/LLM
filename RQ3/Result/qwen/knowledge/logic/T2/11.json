According to premise (11), Stella is a jompus, a lorpus, or a tumpus. We can break this down into cases based on which of these she could be:\n\n- If Stella is a jompus, by premise (4), all jompuses are lempuses. Then, using premise (2), every lorpus is a lempus, but since Stella is not stated directly as a lorpus here, we don't use it in this case. However, we do know that all lempuses are not directly linked to being a rompus, but we can look further into other possibilities.\n- If Stella is a lorpus, by premise (10), every lorpus is a rompus. Therefore, if Stella is a lorpus, she is a rompus.\n- If Stella is a tumpus, by premise (9), every tumpus is a lempus, and by premise (1), we know that all sterpuses are lempuses, but we don't have a direct link between tumpuses and sterpuses. However, premise (6) tells us that every tumpus is a rompus. Thus, if Stella is a tumpus, she is a rompus.\n\nGiven premise (12), which provides an alternative set of possibilities for Stella being a lorpus, tumpus, or sterpus, we can combine it with the fact that if Stella is a lorpus or tumpus, she is definitely a rompus (as shown above). Premise (5) states that each sterpus is a rompus, so even if Stella were a sterpus, she would still be a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the premises needed to prove (13) are those that establish Stella's status as a lorpus, tumpus, or sterpus, which are premises (11) and (12). However, since (12) covers the cases of being a lorpus, tumpus, or sterpus and already implies (11) due to overlapping possibilities, we primarily rely on (12) for our proof. But for clarity in the context of the format requested, we consider the introduction of the necessary premises leading to the conclusion, hence:\n\n(11),(12)->(13) \n\nHowever, recognizing that (12) alone is sufficient to cover all scenarios for Stella being a rompus and includes the conditions of (11), the most concise representation considering the format's requirement for the introduction sequence would still focus on the essential coverage provided by (12):\n\n(12)->(13) \n\nThis is because (12) encompasses the necessary conditions to conclude that Stella is a rompus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Stella is a lorpus or a tumpus or a sterpus.
