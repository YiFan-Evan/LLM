However, based on the requirement to derive the proof obligation from the premises, we focus on the key relationships:\n\n- From (6), we know Max is a tumpus.\n- From (1), since Max is a tumpus, Max is also a dumpus. This proposition is not directly needed for proving (8), but it's part of the context.\n- From (3), since Max is a tumpus, Max is also a lorpus.\n\nGiven this, the minimal set of premises that allows us to conclude Max is a lorpus (and hence satisfies the proof obligation as being luminous or wooden or a lorpus, though the direct implication isn't strictly necessary from the given rules):\n\n- (6) establishes Max is a tumpus.\n- (3) connects tumpus to lorpus.\n\nThus, the correct minimal set of premises leading to the proof obligation is: (6),(3)->(8).\n\nHowever, considering the structure of the problem and the need to adhere strictly to the format requested, and noting that (3) alone combined with (6) can lead to the conclusion that Max is a lorpus, the correct minimal set should indeed include (3) and (6) directly leading to the proof obligation (8):\n\n(6),(3)->(8) \n\nBut for strict adherence to the format requested and considering the direct path to the proof obligation:\n\n(6),(3)->(8) \n\nis the closest accurate representation under the constraints.
