However, none of the premises mention anything about \"lempuses\", \"grimpuses\", or any direct relationship that would allow us to derive these terms. Instead, we can focus on deriving \"tumpus\" from the premises given.\n\nLet's break down the premises and see how they relate to Sally being a tumpus:\n\n1. **Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, or a rompus is a zumpus.**\n   - Sally is a yumpus (from premise 10).\n   - This does not directly tell us if Sally is a tumpus.\n   \n2. **Each impus is a wumpus.**\n   - Irrelevant to Sally being a tumpus.\n\n3. **Every jompus is a wumpus.**\n   - Irrelevant to Sally being a tumpus.\n\n4. **Vumpuses are impuses.**\n   - Irrelevant to Sally being a tumpus.\n\n5. **Vumpuses are sterpuses.**\n   - Irrelevant to Sally being a tumpus.\n\n6. **Every impus is a shumpus, a tumpus, and a jompus.**\n   - Irrelevant to Sally being a tumpus.\n\n7. **Each dumpus is a wumpus.**\n   - Irrelevant to Sally being a tumpus.\n\n8. **Lorpuses are sterpuses.**\n   - Irrelevant to Sally being a tumpus.\n\n9. **Each shumpus is a rompus.**\n   - Irrelevant to Sally being a tumpus.\n\n10. **Sally is a wumpus and a yumpus and a sterpus.**\n    - We know Sally is a yumpus (which doesn't directly help us conclude she is a tumpus).\n\n11. **Sally is a vumpus, a lorpus, and a dumpus.**\n    - We know Sally is a vumpus and a lorpus, but these don't help us conclude she is a tumpus.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we see that none of the premises directly connect Sally to being a tumpus. Therefore, it is impossible to derive the statement \"Sally is a lempus, a tumpus, or a grimpus\" from the given premises. Since there is no way to derive the required conclusion, the correct answer is that no subset of the premises can prove the given statement.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n```\n->\n``` \n\nThis indicates that the given proof obligation cannot be derived from the provided premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
