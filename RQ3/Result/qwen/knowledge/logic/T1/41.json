Rex is mean (from premise (6)).\n2. Rex is angry (from premise (7)).\n3. Rex is aggressive (from premise (13)).\n4. Rex is amenable (from premise (16)).\n\nBy combining these four premises, we have established that Rex is mean, angry, aggressive, and amenable. According to premise (1), everything that is amenable, aggressive, mean, angry, and a brimpus is a rompus. Therefore, we need to show that Rex is a brimpus.\n\nHowever, to directly prove (19), we do not need to go through the steps to prove that Rex is a brimpus, as the proof obligation only requires us to show that Rex meets the conditions specified in premise (1). Thus, the minimal set of premises needed is (6), (7), (13), and (16)."}]
