However, given the specific instruction and the constraint provided in the problem, we can infer that we are looking for an approximate method or a specific approach to solve this problem based on the given constraints.\n\nSince the exact integral isn't straightforward, let's use the given hint about the relationship between integrals. The problem suggests a pattern where the second integral differs from the first by \\( \\frac{1}{2}x^2 \\). But since we don't have another function provided that fits this pattern directly here, we will focus on the integral itself and the substitution.\n\nGiven the complexity, we might assume the problem is designed to leverage a known result or approximation. However, without a simpler form or a numerical method specified, we'll consider the substitution directly into a conceptual form.\n\nFor the sake of this problem, let's consider the integral as it is and substitute \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ \\int e^{e^x} \\, dx \\]\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 4 \\):\n\n\\[ e^{e^4} \\]\n\nThis value is extremely large.
