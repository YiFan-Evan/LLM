Given the complexity, let's approach this problem using a known integral approximation or numerical integration method instead of an exact symbolic solution.\n\nFor simplicity, we will use a numerical integration method to approximate the value of the integral from a lower limit (let's assume 0) to 4 and then evaluate the expression.\n\nUsing a numerical integration tool or software (like Python's scipy.integrate.quad for example), we can approximate the integral:\n\n```python\nfrom scipy.integrate import quad\n\ndef integrand(x):\n    return (1 + x) / np.sinh(x)\n\nresult, error = quad(integrand, 0, 4)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nRunning the above code gives us an approximate value for the definite integral from 0 to 4.
