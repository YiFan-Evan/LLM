[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

However, the indefinite integral of \\( \\cos(x^2) \\) does not have an elementary antiderivative. This means it cannot be expressed in terms of basic functions. Instead, it is typically expressed in terms of special functions like the Fresnel integral.\n\nSince the integral cannot be computed directly using elementary functions, we will use numerical methods or approximations to estimate the value at \\( x = 4 \\). But given the constraints of the problem and the requirement to round down to the nearest integer, we can infer that the exact value isn't necessary for this specific task.\n\nFor practical purposes and based on the instruction, we'll consider the numerical approximation. The value of the Fresnel integral \\( S(4) \\) (which is related to \\( \\cos(x^2) \\)) is approximately 0.488762. Since we are asked to round down, the integer part of this value is 0.\n\nThus, the integer result of the expression after substituting \\( x = 4 \\) and rounding down is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: cos(x^2)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem, we start by finding the indefinite integral of the function \\( \\cos(x^2) + x \\).\n\nThe indefinite integral of \\( \\cos(x^2) + x \\) is the sum of the indefinite integrals of \\( \\cos(x^2) \\) and \\( x \\).
