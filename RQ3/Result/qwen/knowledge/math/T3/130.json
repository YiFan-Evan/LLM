For this specific case, if we were to approximate, we might get something like -1.54, which when rounded down gives us -2.\n\nThus, the integer result of the expression, rounded down, is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{-2}\n\\]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(sin(x))+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem, we first need to integrate the function \\(\\ln(\\sin(x)) + x\\).
