Therefore, we will need to use numerical methods or approximations to evaluate it.\n\nSince the exact form of the indefinite integral is not straightforward to compute directly, we can use numerical integration techniques to approximate the value of the integral at \\( x = 4 \\).\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume we are using a numerical method to find the value of the integral at \\( x = 4 \\).
