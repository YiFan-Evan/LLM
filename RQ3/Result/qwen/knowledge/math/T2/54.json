Unfortunately, this integral does not have a closed form in terms of elementary functions. However, based on the problem statement, we can infer that we need to consider a related function whose integral is easier to handle or is given.\n3. The problem mentions that for two integration problems, if the integrand of the latter is five times that of the former, the result after integration should also differ by a factor of five. This suggests that we might be dealing with a simpler related function that has an integrand five times smaller than \\(e^{e^x}\\).
