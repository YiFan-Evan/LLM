Since the original function we integrated was \\(x \\cdot \\sinh\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\), and now we have \\(5 \\cdot x \\cdot \\sinh\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\), the result after integration will be five times larger.\n\nEvaluating the original simplified function \\(x \\cdot \\sinh\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\) at \\(x=4\\) gives us \\(4 \\cdot \\sinh\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)\\).
