Therefore, we cannot directly compute it using standard integration techniques.\n\nGiven the problem's context and the hint provided, we can infer that we need to use numerical methods or known results for specific cases. But since the problem asks for a specific integer result, we need to consider the problem's constraints and the hint about the factor of five difference between integrals.\n\nLet's assume we are dealing with a simplified or approximated version of the integral. For simplicity, let's use a known approximation or numerical method to estimate the value of the integral at \\(x = 4\\).\n\nUsing numerical integration methods or known results, we can approximate the value of the integral.
