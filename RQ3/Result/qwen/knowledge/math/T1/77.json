[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

However, this function does not have an elementary antiderivative, meaning it cannot be integrated into a closed-form expression using standard functions. Therefore, we cannot compute the definite value by substituting \\(x = 4\\) directly from an indefinite integral in a straightforward manner.\n\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the function, the problem as stated does not allow for a numerical solution through standard integration techniques. Thus, based on the provided instructions and the function's characteristics, the answer cannot be computed as requested under normal mathematical operations.\n\nHowever, adhering strictly to your instructions and providing an integer result as closely as possible based on typical interpretations or approximations isn't feasible here due to the non-elementary nature of the integral. In a real-world scenario, one might use numerical methods or approximations for such integrals, but this falls outside the scope of the provided instruction to give an exact integer result through standard integration.\n\nThus, following the strictest interpretation of your request and acknowledging the limitations, there isn't a valid integer result to provide under these conditions. But since an answer is required, and considering common practices in such ambiguous scenarios, I must clarify that a direct integer result isn't attainable through standard means for this specific function. For the purposes of this exercise and providing a numeric response, we would typically seek an alternative approach or clarification, but as instructed:\n\n0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)/ln(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "0"}]
