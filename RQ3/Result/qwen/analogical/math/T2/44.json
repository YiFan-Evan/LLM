However, for simplicity, let's use integration by parts.\n\nLet u = e^x and dv = sin(x)dx. Then du = e^x dx and v = -cos(x).\n\nUsing the formula for integration by parts \u222budv = uv - \u222bvdu:\n\n\u222be^x * sin(x)dx = -e^x * cos(x) + \u222be^x * cos(x)dx.\n\nNow, let's integrate e^x * cos(x) again using integration by parts, with u = e^x and dv = cos(x)dx. This gives us du = e^x dx and v = sin(x).\n\nSo, \u222be^x * cos(x)dx = e^x * sin(x) - \u222be^x * sin(x)dx.\n\nCombining both equations, we get:\n\n\u222be^x * sin(x)dx = -e^x * cos(x) + e^x * sin(x) - \u222be^x * sin(x)dx.\n\nSolving for \u222be^x * sin(x)dx gives us:\n\n2 * \u222be^x * sin(x)dx = e^x * (sin(x) - cos(x)),\n\nwhich simplifies to:\n\n\u222be^x * sin(x)dx = (1/2)e^x * (sin(x) - cos(x)) + C.\n\n#### Problem 2:\nCalculate the definite integral from 0 to \u03c0 of the function g(x) = x * cos(x).\n\n**Solution:**\nTo integrate x * cos(x), we can again use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = cos(x)dx. Then du = dx and v = sin(x).\n\nUsing the formula for integration by parts \u222budv = uv - \u222bvdu:\n\n\u222bx * cos(x)dx = x * sin(x) - \u222bsin(x)dx = x * sin(x) + cos(x) + C.\n\nTo find the definite integral from 0 to \u03c0:\n\n[x * sin(x) + cos(x)] from 0 to \u03c0 = [\u03c0 * sin(\u03c0) + cos(\u03c0)] - [0 * sin(0) + cos(0)] = [-1] - [1] = -2.\n\n#### Problem 3:\nEvaluate the indefinite integral of h(x) = 1 / (1 + x^2).\n\n**Solution:**\nThe integral of 1 / (1 + x^2) is a standard integral which equals arctan(x) + C.\n\n### Original Problem Solution\n\n#### Problem:\nFind the indefinite integral of ln(x)/sin(x) and then substitute x=4 into the result, rounding down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe function ln(x)/sin(x) does not have an elementary antiderivative, meaning it cannot be expressed in terms of basic functions like polynomials, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions, etc. Therefore, we cannot explicitly find an indefinite integral of this function in a closed form.\n\nHowever, if we hypothetically had an antiderivative F(x) for ln(x)/sin(x), substituting x=4 would give us F(4). Since we do not have an explicit form for F(x), we cannot directly compute F(4) or round it down.\n\nIn a real-world scenario, one might resort to numerical methods or approximations to evaluate the integral at x=4 after finding an approximate antiderivative or using a numerical integration technique such as Simpson\u2019s rule or a computer algebra system to find an approximation of the value at x=4, and then round down to the nearest integer.\n\nSince we cannot perform these steps due to the complexity and the lack of an elementary antiderivative, we conclude that the problem as stated cannot be solved exactly with the methods provided here.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** The problem as stated cannot be solved exactly with elementary methods, and a numerical approximation would be required for a practical solution.
