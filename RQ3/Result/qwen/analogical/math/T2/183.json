The integral becomes \u222bu du = (1/2)u^2 + C = (1/2)sin^2(x) + C.\n\n#### Problem 2:\nEvaluate the integral of e^(2x) from x = 0 to x = 1.\n\n- **Solution**: Let u = 2x, so du = 2dx. The integral becomes (1/2)\u222be^u du = (1/2)e^u + C = (1/2)e^(2x) evaluated from 0 to 1. This results in (1/2)(e^2 - 1).\n\n#### Problem 3:\nCalculate the indefinite integral of cos(2x).\n\n- **Solution**: Using the formula for the integral of cosine, we have (1/2)sin(2x) + C.\n\n### Original Problem Solution\n\n**Problem Statement**: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(e^x) * sin(e^x) and substitute x = 4 into the result.\n\n- **Step 1**: To integrate cos(e^x) * sin(e^x), we can use the substitution method. Let u = e^x, hence du = e^x dx. But we need to adjust the integrand to match our u-substitution. Notice that sin(e^x)cos(e^x) can be rewritten as (1/2)sin(2e^x) using trigonometric identities, but a simpler approach is recognizing that if we set v = sin(e^x), dv = cos(e^x)e^x dx. Therefore, the integral can be seen as \u222bv dv = (1/2)v^2 + C = (1/2)sin^2(e^x) + C.\n\n- **Step 2**: Substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral obtained: (1/2)sin^2(e^4).\n\n- **Step 3**: Evaluate (1/2)sin^2(e^4). Since e^4 is a large positive number, sin(e^4) will oscillate between -1 and 1. However, squaring it will give a value between 0 and 1, and multiplying by (1/2) will give a value between 0 and 0.5. Without calculating the exact value of sin(e^4), we know the result of sin^2(e^4) will be some positive number less than or equal to 1, and when multiplied by 1/2, the result will still be less than 1.\n\nThus, rounding down the result of (1/2)sin^2(e^4) gives us **0**.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: 0**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(cos(e^x)*sin(e^x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's break down the process to solve the problem of finding the indefinite integral of \\(5 \\cdot \\cos(e^x) \\cdot \\sin(e^x)\\) and then substituting \\(x = 4\\), rounding down the result to the nearest integer.\n\n### Related Problems\n\n#### Problem 1:\nFind the indefinite integral of \\(2 \\cdot \\sin(x) \\cdot \\cos(x)\\).\n\n- **Solution**: Use the double-angle identity for sine, \\(\\sin(2x) = 2\\sin(x)\\cos(x)\\).
