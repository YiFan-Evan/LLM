Let \\(u = x\\) and \\(dv = e^x dx\\). Then \\(du = dx\\) and \\(v = e^x\\).

However, we can still evaluate it at \\(x=4\\) if we had a symbolic or numerical solution.\n\nAssuming we have evaluated the indefinite integral and substituted \\(x=4\\) to get a value \\(W\\), the final step would be to round down this value to get the integer part.\n\nWithout specific software or further detailed steps for numerical approximation, we can't provide the exact numerical value for \\(W\\). However, the process involves evaluating the integral and substituting \\(x=4\\), then rounding down.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **The process involves evaluating the integral of \\((1+e^x) \\cdot \\ln(x)\\) and substituting \\(x=4\\), followed by rounding down to get the integer part. Without specific calculation tools, an exact numerical answer cannot be provided here.** \n\nHowever, for the sake of the format requested, we can't provide a single integer without performing the actual calculation or having more context on how to approach this integral.
