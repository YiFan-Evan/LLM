First, let's consider similar problems that involve integration techniques but are not identical to our main problem.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Function**: \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)e^{\\cos(x)}\\)\n\n**Description**: This problem involves integrating a product of trigonometric functions and an exponential function. The integral can be solved using substitution where \\(u = \\cos(x)\\).\n\n**Solution**:\n- Let \\(u = \\cos(x)\\), then \\(du = -\\sin(x)dx\\).\n- The integral becomes \\(\\int -e^{u} du = -e^{u} + C = -e^{\\cos(x)} + C\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 4\\) gives us \\(-e^{\\cos(4)}\\).\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Function**: \\(f(x) = x^2e^x\\)\n\n**Description**: This problem involves integrating a polynomial multiplied by an exponential function.
