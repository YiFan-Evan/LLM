The indefinite integral of \\( \\frac{1}{\\ln(x)} \\) does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, we can still proceed with evaluating the definite integral from some lower bound (typically 1 or some other positive value) up to a specific value of \\( x \\).
