The given function can be simplified before we proceed to find its indefinite integral and evaluate it at x=4.\n\n### Simplified Problem\n\n**Original Problem**: Find the value of the integral of ln(x)/(1/x)*ln(x) evaluated at x=4 and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n- **Simplified Version 1**: Find the value of the integral of ln(x)/ln(x) evaluated at x=4 and round down to the nearest integer.\n  \n  - **Solution**: The expression simplifies to 1, so the integral of 1 with respect to x is simply x. Evaluating this at x=4 gives us 4. Therefore, the answer remains 4 after rounding down.\n  \n- **Simplified Version 2**: Find the value of the integral of x*ln(x) evaluated at x=4 and round down to the nearest integer.\n  \n  - **Solution**: We use integration by parts. Let u = ln(x) and dv = x dx, then du = 1/x dx and v = x^2/2. The integral becomes x^2/2 * ln(x) - \u222b(x^2/2)*(1/x) dx = x^2/2 * ln(x) - x^2/4 + C.

After rounding down, the answer is 7.\n  \n- **Simplified Version 3**: Find the value of the integral of ln(x)^2 evaluated at x=4 and round down to the nearest integer.\n  \n  - **Solution**: We use integration by parts twice. First, let u = ln(x)^2 and dv = dx, then du = 2*ln(x)*(1/x) dx and v = x. The integral becomes x*ln(x)^2 - \u222b2*ln(x) dx. For the remaining integral, let u = ln(x) and dv = dx, then du = 1/x dx and v = x. The integral becomes x*ln(x)^2 - 2*(x*ln(x) - x) + C.

Now, we integrate x*ln(x)^2. Using integration by parts, let u = ln(x)^2 and dv = x dx, then du = 2*ln(x)*(1/x) dx and v = x^2/2. The integral becomes x^2/2 * ln(x)^2 - \u222bx^2/2 * 2*ln(x)*(1/x) dx = x^2/2 * ln(x)^2 - \u222bx*ln(x) dx. We already know from Simplified Version 2 that \u222bx*ln(x) dx = x^2/2 * ln(x) - x^2/4 + C. Thus, our integral becomes x^2/2 * ln(x)^2 - (x^2/2 * ln(x) - x^2/4) + C. Evaluating at x=4 gives us 4^2/2 * ln(4)^2 - (4^2/2 * ln(4) - 4^2/4) = 8*ln(4)^2 - 8*ln(4) + 4 \u2248 8*2.773 - 8*1.386 + 4 \u2248 22.184 - 11.088 + 4 \u2248 15.096.
