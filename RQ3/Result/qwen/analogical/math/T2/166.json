Therefore, the indefinite integral is \\(\\sin(\\cos(x)) + C\\). Substituting \\(x = 4\\), we get \\(\\sin(\\cos(4))\\). Using a calculator, \\(\\cos(4) \\approx -0.6536\\) and \\(\\sin(-0.6536) \\approx -0.6090\\).

Thus, the integral becomes \\(\\frac{1}{2}e^{x^2} + C\\). Substituting \\(x = 4\\), we have \\(\\frac{1}{2}e^{16}\\). Since \\(e^{16}\\) is a very large number, \\(\\frac{1}{2}e^{16}\\) is also a very large number, and when rounded down, it remains a very large positive integer.\n\n3. **Problem 3**: Find the indefinite integral of the function \\(h(x) = \\sin(x)\\cdot\\cos(x)\\) and then substitute \\(x=4\\).\n\n   - **Solution**: The integral of \\(\\sin(x)\\cdot\\cos(x)\\) can be solved using substitution or recognizing it as half the sine of double angle formula. The integral is \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(2x) + C\\). Substituting \\(x = 4\\), we get \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\cos(8)\\).

However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's denote the indefinite integral as \\(F(x)\\). We need to evaluate \\(F(4)\\). Without an explicit form, we would typically use numerical methods or software to approximate the value. For simplicity and based on typical behavior of such integrals, let's assume that the value is approximately close to zero due to oscillatory nature of sine functions.
