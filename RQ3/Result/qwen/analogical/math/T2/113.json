Since we're asked to round down the final result, and C is a constant that will be eliminated when considering the difference between two points or when no specific value for C is needed, we focus on the part that changes with x, which is 4. Thus, the rounded-down result is 4.\n\n### Problem 2:\nLet's consider a slight variation to understand the concept better.\n\n**Function**: e^x/(e^x + 1)\n\n- **Indefinite Integral**: This requires a bit more work. Let u = e^x, then du = e^x dx. The integral becomes \u222bdu/(u+1) = ln|u+1| + C = ln|e^x + 1| + C.\n- **Substitute x=4**: Substituting x=4 gives us ln|e^4 + 1|.

When rounded down, this equals 54.\n\n### Original Problem:\nGiven the original function e^x/e^x = 1, we already know from Problem 1 that substituting x=4 into its indefinite integral x+C results in 4.

Let u = e^x + 1, then du = e^x dx, so the integral becomes \u222b5 * (du/u) = 5 * ln|u| + C = 5 * ln|e^x + 1| + C.\n- **Substitute x=4**: Substituting x=4 gives us 5 * ln(e^4 + 1).
