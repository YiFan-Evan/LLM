The indefinite integral of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is \\(-\\ln|\\cos(x)| + C\\). Substituting \\(x=4\\) into this integral gives us \\(-\\ln|\\cos(4)|\\). Since we are asked for an integer result rounded down, we compute the value of \\(-\\ln|\\cos(4)|\\) which is approximately \\(0.37\\). Rounding down, we get \\(0\\).\n   \n2. **Problem 2:** Calculate the indefinite integral of \\(f(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\) and substitute \\(x=4\\).\n\n   - **Solution:** The integral of \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\) does not have an elementary antiderivative, so we cannot simplify it further using basic integration rules. However, if we were to approximate the definite integral from 0 to 4, it would be known as the sine integral, Si(4). For this specific problem, we'll focus on the simplified version provided in the original question.\n   \n3. **Problem 3:** Calculate the indefinite integral of \\(f(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{e^x}\\) and substitute \\(x=4\\).\n\n   - **Solution:** This integral can be solved using integration by parts. Let \\(u = \\sin(x)\\) and \\(dv = e^{-x}dx\\), then \\(du = \\cos(x)dx\\) and \\(v = -e^{-x}\\).

For the purposes of this problem, let's focus on the original problem given.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\n\n- **Function:** \\(f(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\sin(x)}\\)\n- **Simplification:** This simplifies to \\(f(x) = 1\\).\n- **Indefinite Integral:** The indefinite integral of \\(1\\) is \\(x + C\\).\n- **Substitution:** Substituting \\(x=4\\) into \\(x + C\\) gives us \\(4 + C\\). Since we are asked to ignore the constant \\(C\\) and provide the integer part of the result, we get \\(4\\).\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: 4**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "sin(x)/sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\sin(x)} \\):\n\n1. **Simplify the Function:**\n   The function simplifies to \\( f(x) = 1 \\).\n\n2. **Calculate the Indefinite Integral:**\n   The indefinite integral of \\( f(x) = 1 \\) is \\( \\int 1 \\, dx = x + C \\).\n\n3. **Substitute \\( x = 4 \\):**\n   Substituting \\( x = 4 \\) into the indefinite integral \\( x + C \\) gives \\( 4 + C \\).
