Find the indefinite integral of this function.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe indefinite integral of \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\ln(x)}\\) does not have a simple closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. However, it can be expressed using the logarithmic integral function \\(li(x)\\), which is defined as:\n\n\\[li(x) = \\int_0^x \\frac{dt}{\\ln(t)}\\]\n\nBut for the purposes of this problem, we will use the notation that the indefinite integral is represented as \\(Li(x) + C\\), where \\(Li(x)\\) is the offset logarithmic integral function, a special case of the logarithmic integral function starting from 2 instead of 0.\n\n### Problem 2:\nNow, consider substituting \\(x = 4\\) into the indefinite integral of the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\ln(x)}\\).\n\n**Solution:**\nSubstituting \\(x = 4\\) into the indefinite integral of \\(f(x)\\) gives us \\(Li(4) + C\\). Since we are only interested in the value at \\(x = 4\\) without the constant of integration, we focus on \\(Li(4)\\).\n\n### Problem 3:\nFinally, provide an integer approximation for the value of \\(Li(4)\\).\n\n**Solution:**\nThe value of \\(Li(4)\\) is approximately 2.163588594217565.
