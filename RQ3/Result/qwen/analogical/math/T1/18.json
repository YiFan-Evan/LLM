Here, we are interested in the indefinite integral without the constant \\(C\\), so the integral is simply \\(\\sin(x)\\).\n- **Note:** This problem is related to the original problem because both involve trigonometric functions and indefinite integrals.\n\n**Problem 2:** Calculate the value of the indefinite integral of \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) at \\(x = \\pi/2\\).\n\n- **Solution:** First, find the indefinite integral of \\(\\sin(x)\\), which is \\(-\\cos(x) + C\\). Without the constant \\(C\\), it's \\(-\\cos(x)\\). Substituting \\(x = \\pi/2\\) gives us \\(-\\cos(\\pi/2) = -0 = 0\\).\n- **Note:** This problem involves substitution after finding the indefinite integral, similar to what we'll do with the original problem, but uses a different value for \\(x\\).\n\n**Problem 3:** Determine the value of the indefinite integral of \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\) at \\(x = 0\\).\n\n- **Solution:** The indefinite integral of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(-\\cos(x)\\). Substituting \\(x = 0\\) gives us \\(-\\cos(0) = -1\\).\n- **Note:** This problem also involves substitution after finding the indefinite integral, similar to the original problem, but uses a different value for \\(x\\).\n\n### Solution to the Original Problem\n\nFor the original problem, \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\):\n\n1. The indefinite integral of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(-\\cos(x) + C\\). Ignoring the constant \\(C\\), we have \\(-\\cos(x)\\).\n2. Substituting \\(x = 4\\) into \\(-\\cos(x)\\) gives \\(-\\cos(4)\\).\n3. The value of \\(\\cos(4)\\) in radians is approximately \\(-0.6536\\), so \\(-\\cos(4)\\) is approximately \\(0.6536\\).\n4.
