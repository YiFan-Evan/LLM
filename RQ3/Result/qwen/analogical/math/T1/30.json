Calculate the indefinite integral of the given function.\n2. Substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral.\n3. Round down the result to get the integer value.\n\n### Related Problems\n\n#### Problem 1: \nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^(2x), then substitute x = 2 into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. The indefinite integral of e^(2x) is (1/2)e^(2x).\n2. Substituting x = 2 gives (1/2)e^(2*2) = (1/2)e^4.\n3. Since e^4 \u2248 54.598, (1/2)e^4 \u2248 27.299. Rounding down gives 27.\n\n#### Problem 2:\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 3e^x, then substitute x = 4 into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. The indefinite integral of 3e^x is 3e^x.\n2. Substituting x = 4 gives 3e^4.\n3. Since e^4 \u2248 54.598, 3e^4 \u2248 163.794. Rounding down gives 163.\n\n#### Problem 3:\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x + 2, then substitute x = 4 into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. The indefinite integral of e^x + 2 is e^x + 2x.\n2. Substituting x = 4 gives e^4 + 2*4 = e^4 + 8.\n3. Since e^4 \u2248 54.598, e^4 + 8 \u2248 62.598. Rounding down gives 62.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\n\n1. The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x.\n2. Substituting x = 4 gives e^4.\n3. Since e^4 \u2248 54.598, rounding down gives 54.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: 54.**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's follow the steps as outlined:\n\n1. **Calculate the indefinite integral of the function** \\(f(x) = e^x\\):\n   - The indefinite integral of \\(e^x\\) is simply \\(e^x\\) itself.\n\n2. **Substitute \\(x = 4\\) into the result of the indefinite integral**:\n   - Substituting \\(x = 4\\) into \\(e^x\\) gives us \\(e^4\\).\n\n3. **Round down the result to get the integer value**:\n   - Since \\(e^4 \\approx 54.598\\), when rounded down to the nearest integer, it becomes \\(54\\).\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: 54.**"}]
