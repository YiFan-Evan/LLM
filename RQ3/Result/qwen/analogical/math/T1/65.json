Since the exact integral is complex, we will use numerical integration techniques or software tools to find the value at \\( x = 4 \\).\n\nUsing a numerical integration tool, we can approximate the definite integral from 0 to 4 of \\( \\sinh(x^2) \\), but since the problem asks for the indefinite integral evaluated at \\( x = 4 \\), we need to consider the behavior of the function.
