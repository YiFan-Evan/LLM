Notice that for all \\(x \\neq -1\\), the fraction simplifies to 1. Thus, the function to integrate is simply \\(f(x) = 1\\).\n\n**Solution:** The indefinite integral of \\(f(x) = 1\\) is \\(F(x) = x + C\\).

This introduces an additional component to integrate.\n\n**Solution:** The indefinite integral of \\(g(x)\\) is \\(G(x) = x + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\\).

Substituting \\(x = 4\\) results in \\(H(4) = 4 - \\frac{16}{2} = 4 - 8 = -4\\).\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nGiven the original function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1+x}{1+x}\\), after simplification, we integrate \\(f(x) = 1\\), leading to \\(F(x) = x + C\\).
