First, we will present three related but not identical problems, including their solutions. Then, we will provide the answer to the original problem.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Function:** sin(x)\n\n**Question:** Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x), substitute x = 4 into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. **Indefinite Integral:** The indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x).\n2. **Substitute x = 4:** Substituting x = 4 into -cos(x) gives -cos(4).\n3. **Evaluate and Round Down:** Using a calculator, cos(4) \u2248 -0.6536, so -cos(4) \u2248 0.6536. Rounding down to the nearest integer, we get 0.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Function:** e^x\n\n**Question:** Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x, substitute x = 4 into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. **Indefinite Integral:** The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x.\n2. **Substitute x = 4:** Substituting x = 4 into e^x gives e^4.\n3. **Evaluate and Round Down:** Using a calculator, e^4 \u2248 54.5982. Rounding down to the nearest integer, we get 54.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Function:** x^2\n\n**Question:** Calculate the indefinite integral of x^2, substitute x = 4 into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. **Indefinite Integral:** The indefinite integral of x^2 is (1/3)x^3.\n2. **Substitute x = 4:** Substituting x = 4 into (1/3)x^3 gives (1/3)(4^3) = (1/3)(64) = 64/3 \u2248 21.3333.\n3. **Evaluate and Round Down:** Rounding down to the nearest integer, we get 21.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Function:** cos(x)\n\n**Question:** Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x), substitute x = 4 into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. **Indefinite Integral:** The indefinite integral of cos(x) is sin(x).\n2. **Substitute x = 4:** Substituting x = 4 into sin(x) gives sin(4).\n3. **Evaluate and Round Down:** Using a calculator, sin(4) \u2248 0.7568.
