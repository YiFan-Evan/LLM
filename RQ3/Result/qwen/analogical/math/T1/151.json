Substitute \\(x = 4\\): \\(2(4) + \\frac{1}{2}(4)^2 = 8 + \\frac{1}{2}(16) = 8 + 8 = 16\\).\n3. Since we are asked for an integer result by rounding down, the answer remains \\(16\\).\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Function:** \\(g(x) = 1 + (1 + x) + x^2\\)\n\n**Description:** Here, we integrate a quadratic function that includes the original linear function plus an additional quadratic term.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n1.

Integrate \\(h(x) = 1 + 1 + x + 2x^2 = 2 + x + 2x^2\\) to get \\(\\int (2 + x + 2x^2) dx = 2x + \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + \\frac{2}{3}x^3 + C\\).\n2. Substitute \\(x = 4\\): \\(2(4) + \\frac{1}{2}(4)^2 + \\frac{2}{3}(4)^3 = 8 + \\frac{1}{2}(16) + \\frac{2}{3}(64) = 8 + 8 + \\frac{128}{3} = 16 + \\frac{128}{3}\\).\n3.
