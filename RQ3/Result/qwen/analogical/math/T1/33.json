Evaluating this at \\(x = 4\\) gives \\(4 + C\\). Since we are asked for an integer result by rounding down and \\(C\\) is a constant that does not affect the integer part, the result is simply \\(4\\).\n\n**Problem 2:** Find the indefinite integral of \\(x\\) and then evaluate it at \\(x = 4\\).\n\n- **Solution:** The indefinite integral of \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{x^2}{2} + C\\). Evaluating this at \\(x = 4\\) gives \\(\\frac{4^2}{2} + C = 8 + C\\). Again, since we are rounding down, the integer part of \\(8 + C\\) is \\(8\\).\n\n**Problem 3:** Find the indefinite integral of \\(1 + x\\) and then evaluate it at \\(x = 4\\).\n\n- **Solution:** The indefinite integral of \\(1 + x\\) is \\(x + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\\). Evaluating this at \\(x = 4\\) gives \\(4 + \\frac{4^2}{2} + C = 4 + 8 + C = 12 + C\\). Rounding down, the integer part of \\(12 + C\\) is \\(12\\).\n\n### Step 2: Solve the Original Problem\n\n**Original Problem:** Find the indefinite integral of \\(1 + x\\) and then evaluate it at \\(x = 4\\).\n\n- **Solution:** As previously calculated, the indefinite integral of \\(1 + x\\) is \\(x + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\\). Evaluating this at \\(x = 4\\) gives \\(4 + \\frac{4^2}{2} + C = 4 + 8 + C = 12 + C\\). By rounding down, the integer part of \\(12 + C\\) is \\(12\\).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \\(12\\)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the function \\(1 + x\\), we need to find the indefinite integral of this function and then substitute \\(x = 4\\) into the result before rounding down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n#### Step 1: Find the Indefinite Integral\n\nThe indefinite integral of \\(1 + x\\) is:\n\\[ \\int (1 + x) \\, dx = \\int 1 \\, dx + \\int x \\, dx = x + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C \\]\n\nHere, \\(C\\) is the constant of integration which can be ignored when substituting specific values.\n\n#### Step 2: Substitute \\(x = 4\\)\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 4\\) into the indefinite integral:\n\\[ x + \\frac{x^2}{2} = 4 + \\frac{4^2}{2} = 4 + \\frac{16}{2} = 4 + 8 = 12 \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Round Down\n\nSince \\(12\\) is already an integer, rounding down does not change the value.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \\(12\\)."}]
