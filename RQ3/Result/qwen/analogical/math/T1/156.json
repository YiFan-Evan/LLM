The integral of this function can be found using integration by parts.\n\n**Solution**:\nTo integrate \\(x e^x\\), we use integration by parts where we let \\(u = x\\) and \\(dv = e^x dx\\). Then, \\(du = dx\\) and \\(v = e^x\\). Using the formula \\(\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\int x e^x dx = x e^x - \\int e^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C = e^x (x - 1) + C\n\\]\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Function**: \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2} e^x\\)\n\n**Description**: This problem involves integrating a function that combines a reciprocal polynomial with an exponential function. This requires the use of integration techniques such as substitution or integration by parts.\n\n**Solution**:\nWe aim to integrate \\(\\frac{1}{x^2} e^x\\). This does not have a straightforward antiderivative, so it's often left in terms of an integral or solved using special functions like the exponential integral. However, for demonstration purposes, we might attempt integration by parts with \\(u = \\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(dv = \\frac{1}{x} e^x dx\\).
