The indefinite integral of \\(\\cos(x)\\) is \\(\\sin(x)\\). Evaluating at \\(x=4\\) yields \\(\\sin(4)\\). Since \\(\\sin(4)\\) is approximately \\(0.7568\\), rounding down gives us \\(0\\).\n   \n2. **Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of \\(e^{\\ln(\\tan(x))}\\) and evaluate it at \\(x=4\\).\n   - **Solution**: This simplifies to \\(\\tan(x)\\). The indefinite integral of \\(\\tan(x)\\) is \\(-\\ln|\\cos(x)|\\). Evaluating at \\(x=4\\) gives \\(-\\ln|\\cos(4)|\\). Since \\(\\cos(4)\\) is approximately \\(-0.6536\\), \\(-\\ln|-0.6536|\\) is approximately \\(0.4269\\), rounding down gives us \\(0\\).\n   \n3. **Problem**: Evaluate the indefinite integral of \\(e^{\\ln(x)}\\) at \\(x=4\\).\n   - **Solution**: Simplifies to \\(x\\). The indefinite integral of \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{x^2}{2}\\). Evaluating at \\(x=4\\) gives \\(\\frac{4^2}{2} = 8\\).

The indefinite integral of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(-\\cos(x)\\). Evaluating at \\(x=4\\) gives \\(-\\cos(4)\\). Since \\(\\cos(4)\\) is approximately \\(-0.6536\\), \\(-(-0.6536)\\) equals approximately \\(0.6536\\).
