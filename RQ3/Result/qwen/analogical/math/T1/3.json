Substituting x = \u03c0/2 into -cos(x) gives us -cos(\u03c0/2) = -0 = 0.\n\n2. **Problem 2:** Find the indefinite integral of e^x and then substitute x = 2 into the result.\n   \n   **Solution:** The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x itself. Substituting x = 2 into e^x gives us e^2 \u2248 7.389. Rounded down, this is 7.\n\n3. **Problem 3:** Determine the indefinite integral of x^2 and then substitute x = 3 into the result.\n   \n   **Solution:** The indefinite integral of x^2 is (1/3)x^3.
