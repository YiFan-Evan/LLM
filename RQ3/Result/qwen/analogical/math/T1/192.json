So,\n\n\\[\n\\frac{-(-0.6536)}{4} \\approx \\frac{0.6536}{4} \\approx 0.1634\n\\]\n\nRounding down, the final result is:\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: 0**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1/x)*sin(x)/x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears that the function expression you've given is \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x^2}\\).
