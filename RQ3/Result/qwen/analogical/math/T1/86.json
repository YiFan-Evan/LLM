The process would involve integration techniques for exponential and trigonometric functions.\n\n**Solution:** The integral of \\( \\frac{e^x}{\\sin(x)} \\) does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. Therefore, it's typically solved using numerical methods or series expansions. Since we are asked to follow the instructions without providing such detailed solutions, we can note that this problem diverges from our main goal as the given function \\( \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\) has a more straightforward indefinite integral path.\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Function:** \\(g(x) = \\frac{x^2}{\\cos(x)}\\)\n\n**Description:** This problem involves finding the indefinite integral of a function where the numerator is a polynomial function instead of an exponential one. This changes the nature of the problem significantly, requiring different integration techniques.\n\n**Solution:** Similar to the previous example, integrating \\( \\frac{x^2}{\\cos(x)} \\) does not yield a simple closed-form solution. It requires advanced integration techniques or numerical methods, which again diverge from our primary task of solving \\( \\int \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} dx \\).\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Function:** \\(h(x) = \\frac{e^x}{1+\\cos(x)}\\)\n\n**Description:** This problem involves a slight modification of the denominator, changing it from just \\(\\cos(x)\\) to \\(1+\\cos(x)\\). This changes the complexity of the problem, as the denominator is no longer a simple trigonometric function but a sum involving one.\n\n**Solution:** The integral of \\( \\frac{e^x}{1+\\cos(x)} \\) also lacks a simple closed-form solution and would require special techniques or numerical approximation. This example serves to highlight the variety of challenges that can arise when dealing with integrals of exponential and trigonometric functions combined.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nGiven the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)}\\), we aim to find the indefinite integral and then evaluate it at \\(x=4\\).\n\n**Indefinite Integral:** The integral of \\( \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\) does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, for the sake of following the instruction and providing a structured response, let's assume hypothetically that we could find such an integral \\(F(x)\\).\n\n**Substitution:** Substituting \\(x=4\\) into \\(F(x)\\) would give us \\(F(4)\\).\n\nSince the actual indefinite integral does not simplify neatly into a form we can directly compute, let's proceed under the assumption that we have found a suitable \\(F(x)\\) and evaluate it at \\(x=4\\).\n\nHowever, based on the problem statement and the guidelines provided, we cannot derive a specific numerical value for the integral of \\( \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\) due to its complexity. Thus, following the structure required, we must conclude based on the hypothetical scenario set forth.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** As the exact computation isn't feasible within standard elementary functions and adhering strictly to the format requested, we cannot provide a numerical answer. Yet, if hypothetically we had computed it, the next step would be to round down the obtained value.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's denote the indefinite integral as \\( F(x) \\).\n\n\\[ F(x) = \\int \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\, dx \\]\n\nThis integral is complex and typically requires special functions or numerical methods for evaluation.
