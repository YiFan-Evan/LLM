Substituting \\(x = 4\\) into this result gives us \\(\\frac{4^3}{3} = \\frac{64}{3}\\). Rounding down, the final result is \\(21\\).\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Function:** \\(f(x) = \\sin(x)\\)\n\n**Solution:** The indefinite integral of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(-\\cos(x)\\). Substituting \\(x = 4\\) into this result gives us \\(-\\cos(4)\\). Since \\(\\cos(4)\\) is approximately \\(0.6536\\), \\(-\\cos(4)\\) is approximately \\(-0.6536\\). Rounding down, the final result is \\(-1\\).\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Function:** \\(f(x) = \\ln(x)\\)\n\n**Solution:** The indefinite integral of \\(\\ln(x)\\) is \\(x\\ln(x) - x\\). Substituting \\(x = 4\\) into this result gives us \\(4\\ln(4) - 4\\). Since \\(\\ln(4)\\) is approximately \\(1.3863\\), \\(4\\ln(4) - 4\\) is approximately \\(5.5452 - 4 = 1.5452\\). Rounding down, the final result is \\(1\\).\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Function:** \\(f(x) = e^x\\)\n\n**Solution:** The indefinite integral of \\(e^x\\) is \\(e^x\\). Substituting \\(x = 4\\) into this result gives us \\(e^4\\).
