However, for this specific problem, we will focus on the substitution part assuming we already have an integral expression.\n\nIf we were to substitute \\(x = 2\\) into the integral result of \\(\\sin(\\cosh(x))\\), we would get \\(\\sin(\\cosh(2))\\).

However, if we were to substitute \\(x = 4\\) into the integral result of \\(\\cos(\\sinh(x))\\), we would get \\(\\cos(\\sinh(4))\\).
