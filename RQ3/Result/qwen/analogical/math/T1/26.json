Let \\(u = 2x\\), so \\(du = 2dx\\) or \\(dx = \\frac{1}{2}du\\). Thus, the integral becomes \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\int e^u du = \\frac{1}{2}e^u + C = \\frac{1}{2}e^{2x} + C\\).\n\n**Problem 2:** Calculate the value of the definite integral of \\(e^x\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(4\\).\n\n- **Solution:** The indefinite integral of \\(e^x\\) is \\(e^x + C\\). For the definite integral from \\(0\\) to \\(4\\), we evaluate \\([e^x]_0^4 = e^4 - e^0 = e^4 - 1\\). Using \\(e \\approx 2.718\\), \\(e^4 \\approx 54.598\\), so the definite integral is approximately \\(53.598\\).\n\n**Problem 3:** Calculate the indefinite integral of \\(x e^x\\).\n\n- **Solution:** We use integration by parts for this problem, where \\(u = x\\) and \\(dv = e^x dx\\). Then, \\(du = dx\\) and \\(v = e^x\\). The formula for integration by parts is \\(\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du\\). Therefore, \\(\\int x e^x dx = xe^x - \\int e^x dx = xe^x - e^x + C = e^x(x - 1) + C\\).\n\n### Solution to Original Problem\n\n**Original Problem:** Calculate the indefinite integral of \\(e^x\\) and then substitute \\(x = 4\\) into the result, rounding down to the nearest integer.\n\n- **Solution:** The indefinite integral of \\(e^x\\) is \\(e^x + C\\). Substituting \\(x = 4\\) into this result gives \\(e^4 + C\\). Since we are asked to round down the result (and \\(C\\) is a constant that does not affect the rounding), we focus on \\(e^4\\). Given \\(e \\approx 2.718\\), \\(e^4 \\approx 54.598\\). Rounding down, we get \\(54\\).\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: 54.**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the given problem, let's follow the outlined steps:\n\n1.
