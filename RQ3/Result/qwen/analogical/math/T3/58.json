Rounding down, we get \\(14\\).\n\n### Original Problem\n\n**Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of \\(e^{x^2}\\) and substitute \\(x = 4\\).\n\n- **Solution**: The indefinite integral of \\(e^{x^2}\\) does not have an elementary antiderivative, meaning it cannot be expressed in terms of basic functions. However, if we were to evaluate the definite integral or approximate the integral for a specific range, we could use numerical methods like Simpson's rule or other approximation techniques. But since we are asked to substitute \\(x = 4\\) directly into the indefinite integral, we can't do this exactly using elementary functions.\n\nSince the exact integral of \\(e^{x^2}\\) is not expressible in elementary terms, we cannot compute it directly as shown in the previous examples. Therefore, the problem as stated does not have a straightforward answer using elementary functions.\n\nHowever, if we assume the problem is asking for an approximation or a conceptual understanding that the integral of \\(e^{x^2}\\) evaluated at \\(x = 4\\) is not computable in elementary terms, we can state:\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: undefined in elementary terms.**\n\nBut if we strictly follow the format requested and consider the spirit of the problem:\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: undefined.** \n\n(Note: If numerical methods or special functions were used, a specific numerical value could be approximated, but this goes beyond the scope of elementary calculus.)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x^2+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Related Problems\n\n1. **Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of \\(e^x + x\\) and substitute \\(x = 4\\).\n   - **Solution**: The indefinite integral of \\(e^x + x\\) is \\(e^x + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\\). Substituting \\(x = 4\\) gives \\(e^4 + \\frac{4^2}{2} = e^4 + 8\\). The value of \\(e^4\\) is approximately \\(54.5982\\), so \\(e^4 + 8\\) is approximately \\(62.5982\\).

Substituting \\(x = 4\\) gives \\(e^4 + 4^2 = e^4 + 16\\). The value of \\(e^4\\) is approximately \\(54.5982\\), so \\(e^4 + 16\\) is approximately \\(70.5982\\).
