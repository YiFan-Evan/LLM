The original problem involves an integral of a hyperbolic function combined with an algebraic one. We'll follow a similar pattern for our created problems.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Function:** \\(f(x) = \\frac{\\cosh(x)}{\\cosh(x)}\\cdot\\frac{1}{x}\\)\n\n- **Description:** This problem involves integrating a hyperbolic cosine function over itself, simplified to \\(1\\), multiplied by \\(1/x\\). The process will be similar to the original problem where we integrate the function, then substitute \\(x=4\\) into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\n  \n- **Solution:** The function simplifies to \\(1/x\\).
