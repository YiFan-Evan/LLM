Typically, the sine function divided by \\(x\\) is written as \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\), which is different from \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x^2}\\). Assuming the intended function is \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\), let's consider both cases for clarity.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Function**: \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x^2}\\)\n\n**Solution Approach**:\nTo integrate \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x^2}\\), we can use integration by parts. Let \\(u = \\frac{1}{x}\\) and \\(dv = \\sin(x) dx\\). Then, \\(du = -\\frac{1}{x^2} dx\\) and \\(v = -\\cos(x)\\).\n\nUsing the formula for integration by parts \\(\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du\\):\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x^2} dx = -\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x} - \\int \\left(-\\cos(x)\\right) \\left(-\\frac{1}{x^2}\\right) dx = -\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x} + \\int \\frac{\\cos(x)}{x^2} dx.\n\\]\n\nThis integral is quite complex and does not have an elementary antiderivative.
