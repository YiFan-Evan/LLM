Substituting x=4 gives -cos(4). Since cos(4) \u2248 -0.6536, -cos(4) \u2248 0.6536.

Substituting x=4 gives sin(4). Since sin(4) \u2248 0.7568, rounding down to the nearest integer gives 0.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Function:** h(x) = e^x\n\n**Description:** Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x, substitute x=4 into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution:** The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C. Substituting x=4 gives e^4. Since e^4 \u2248 54.5982, rounding down to the nearest integer gives 54.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Function:** f(x) = sin(x)\n\n**Description:** Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x), substitute x=4 into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution:** As previously described, the indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C. Substituting x=4 gives -cos(4). Since cos(4) \u2248 -0.6536, -cos(4) \u2248 0.6536.
