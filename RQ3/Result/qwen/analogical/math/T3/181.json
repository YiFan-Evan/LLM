Substituting \\(x=4\\) into \\(e^x\\) gives us \\(e^4\\).

Let \\(u = x\\) and \\(dv = e^x dx\\), so \\(du = dx\\) and \\(v = e^x\\). Applying the formula for integration by parts (\\(\\int u dv = uv - \\int v du\\)), we get:\n\\[\n\\int x \\cdot e^x dx = x \\cdot e^x - \\int e^x dx = x \\cdot e^x - e^x + C = e^x(x - 1) + C\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(x=4\\) into \\(e^x(x-1)\\) gives us \\(e^4(4-1) = 3e^4\\).
