Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives ln|sin(4)|. Since the sine of 4 radians is approximately -0.7568, ln|-0.7568| does not exist as a real number because the natural logarithm is not defined for negative numbers. Thus, this problem is not applicable for the current context.\n\n#### Problem 2:\nThe function is: tan(x).\n\n- **Solution**: The indefinite integral of tan(x) is -ln|cos(x)| + C. Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives -ln|cos(4)|. Since the cosine of 4 radians is approximately -0.6536, ln|-0.6536| also does not exist as a real number for the same reason.
