Substituting x = 4 into -cos(x) gives us -cos(4). Since cos(4) \u2248 -0.6536, -cos(4) \u2248 0.6536. Rounding down, we get 0.\n\n### Problem 2: e^x\n**Description:** Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x, then substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral.\n\n**Solution:** The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x. Substituting x = 4 into e^x gives us e^4.

Substituting x = 4 into sin(x) + (1/2)x^2 gives us sin(4) + (1/2)(4)^2. Since sin(4) \u2248 0.7568 and (1/2)(4)^2 = 8, the sum is approximately 0.7568 + 8 = 8.7568.
