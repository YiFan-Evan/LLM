Let's break it down:\n\n  \\[\n  \\int \\left( \\frac{\\cos(x) \\cdot x^2}{e^x} + x \\right) dx = \\int \\frac{\\cos(x) \\cdot x^2}{e^x} dx + \\int x dx\n  \\]\n\n  The integral \\(\\int x dx\\) is straightforward:\n\n  \\[\n  \\int x dx = \\frac{x^2}{2}\n  \\]\n\n  For \\(\\int \\frac{\\cos(x) \\cdot x^2}{e^x} dx\\), we use integration by parts. Let \\(u = x^2\\) and \\(dv = \\frac{\\cos(x)}{e^x} dx\\).
