However, if we assume that the question implies using the same logic as the previous examples but recognizing the complexity, we might consider the integral evaluated at \\(x=4\\) as a theoretical value that needs approximation or numerical methods. For the sake of this exercise, let's hypothetically consider the value of \\(e^{e^4}\\) as our target since it closely relates to the integral's evaluation. \\(e^{e^4}\\) is a very large number, but for the sake of this hypothetical exercise, we recognize the complexity and move forward with understanding that direct computation isn't straightforward.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Function:** \\(f(x) = e^{e^x}\\)\n\n**Description:** Similar to Problem 3, this involves integrating an exponential function where the exponent itself is also an exponential function of \\(x\\).
