Therefore, the indefinite integral of this function is simply \\(x + C\\).

The indefinite integral is \\(-x - 2\\ln|x-1| + C\\). When substituting \\(x = 4\\), we get \\(-4 - 2\\ln|3|\\). Since \\(\\ln(3)\\) is approximately \\(1.0986\\), the expression evaluates to approximately \\(-4 - 2(1.0986) = -4 - 2.1972 = -6.1972\\).

The indefinite integral is \\(x - \\ln|2+x| + C\\). When substituting \\(x = 4\\), we get \\(4 - \\ln|6|\\).

The term \\(\\frac{1+x}{1-x}\\) simplifies to \\(-1 - \\frac{2}{x-1}\\). Thus, the entire function becomes \\(-1 - \\frac{2}{x-1} + x\\). The indefinite integral is \\(-x - 2\\ln|x-1| + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\\). When substituting \\(x = 4\\), we get \\(-4 - 2\\ln|3| + \\frac{4^2}{2} = -4 - 2\\ln|3| + 8 = 4 - 2\\ln|3|\\). Since \\(\\ln(3)\\) is approximately \\(1.0986\\), the expression evaluates to approximately \\(4 - 2(1.0986) = 4 - 2.1972 = 1.8028\\).

The indefinite integral is \\(x - \\ln|2+x| + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\\). When substituting \\(x = 4\\), we get \\(4 - \\ln|6| + \\frac{4^2}{2} = 4 - \\ln|6| + 8 = 12 - \\ln|6|\\). Since \\(\\ln(6)\\) is approximately \\(1.7918\\), the expression evaluates to approximately \\(12 - 1.7918 = 10.2082\\).
