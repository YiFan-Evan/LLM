However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have computed it symbolically or numerically, and then substituted \\(x=4\\). The actual numerical value would be calculated using computational tools due to the complexity of the function.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Function:**  \n\\[g(x) = \\frac{e^x}{\\sinh(x)}\\]\n\n**Description:**  \nThis time, we seek the indefinite integral of \\(\\frac{e^x}{\\sinh(x)}\\) and then substitute \\(x=4\\) into the derived function.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe indefinite integral of \\(\\frac{e^x}{\\sinh(x)}\\) can be expressed as \\(-e^{-x} + e^x - 2\\arctan(e^x)\\) plus a constant.
