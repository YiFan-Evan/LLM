However, for the sake of this exercise, let's denote the indefinite integral as \\(F(x)\\). The value we are interested in is \\(F(4)\\).\n\nSince an exact expression is complex, we can use numerical methods or software tools to approximate \\(F(4)\\). For this example, let's assume after using such tools, we get an approximate value for \\(F(4)\\) which we will then round down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Function**: \\(g(x) = \\ln(\\cos(x))\\)\n\n**Description**: Similar to Problem 1, we find the indefinite integral of \\(\\ln(\\cos(x))\\), substitute \\(x=4\\), and round down to the nearest integer.\n\n**Solution**: Similarly, the indefinite integral of \\(\\ln(\\cos(x))\\) does not have a simple closed-form expression.
