Alex is discordant or a grimpus.\n\n### Solution\n\nFrom premise (6), we know Alex is a jompus. According to premise (1), everything that is a jompus is a grimpus. Therefore, Alex is a grimpus.\n\nSince Alex is a grimpus, we can use premise (5) which states that everything that is discordant or a grimpus is a gorpus. However, we don't need to go through the gorpus step directly. We already have Alex being a grimpus, so it satisfies the condition of premise (5).\n\nThus, we conclude that Alex is discordant or a grimpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove this is (6) and (1).\n\nSo the answer is:\n(6),(1)->(8)\n\n### Problem Description\n\nGiven the premises:\n1.
