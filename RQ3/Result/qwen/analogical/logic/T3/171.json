Here are three related but not identical problems to illustrate different scenarios:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:** [(1) Lempuses are not cold. (2) Gorpuses are tumpuses. (3) Each lempus is a wumpus. (19) Stella is a lempus. (20) Stella is a gorpus.)  \n**Proof Obligation:** (21) Stella is not large.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom (19), we know Stella is a lempus. From (1), we know lempuses are not cold, but this does not help us determine if Stella is large or not. Similarly, (20) tells us Stella is a gorpus, but there is no information about whether gorpuses are large or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Stella is not large based on these premises alone. We need more information about the size of lempuses or gorpuses.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:** [(1) Lempuses are not cold. (2) Gorpuses are tumpuses. (3) Each lempus is a wumpus. (19) Stella is a lempus. (20) Stella is a gorpus.)  \n**Proof Obligation:** (21) Stella is not cold.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom (19), we know Stella is a lempus. From (1), we know lempuses are not cold. Therefore, Stella is not cold. This is a valid proof because we directly use the premise that lempuses are not cold.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:** [(1) Lempuses are not cold. (2) Gorpuses are tumpuses. (3) Each lempus is a wumpus. (19) Stella is a lempus. (20) Stella is a gorpus.)  \n**Proof Obligation:** (21) Stella is not aggressive.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom (19), we know Stella is a lempus. There is no information about the aggression level of lempuses. Similarly, (20) tells us Stella is a gorpus, but there is no information about the aggression level of gorpuses. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Stella is not aggressive based on these premises alone. We need more information about the aggression level of lempuses or gorpuses.\n\nNow, let's solve the original problem using the correct premises:\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Premises:** [(1) Lempuses are not cold.

Let's break down the problem into simpler steps and provide solutions for similar scenarios:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:** [(1) if Stella is not large then Taylor is a visionary. (20) Stella is a lempus. (21) Stella is a gorpus.)  \n**Proof Obligation:** (22) Taylor is a visionary.\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe need to establish that Stella is not large.

Therefore, we cannot conclude that Stella is not large based on these premises alone.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:** [(1) if Stella is not large then Taylor is a visionary. (19) Stella is a lempus. (20) Stella is a gorpus. (15) Yumpuses are not large. (14) Yumpuses are not large. (8) Each tumpus is not loud. (17) Sterpuses are jompuses. (18) Every gorpus is a lorpus.

Stella being a lempus and a gorpus leads to her being a yumpus, and thus not large. Therefore, Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Final Solution:\nGiven the premises, we need to show that Stella is not large to prove Taylor is a visionary. From (20) and (21), we know Stella is a lempus and a gorpus. From (18), every gorpus is a lorpus. From (11), lorpuses are sterpuses. From (9), sterpuses are yumpuses. From (15), yumpuses are not large. Therefore, Stella is not large. By premise (1), if Stella is not large, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation is (20), (21), (18), (11), (9), and (15).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (20),(21),(18),(11),(9),(15)->(22)."}]
