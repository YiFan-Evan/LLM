If we can establish that Sally is a jompus or related to being a jompus, we can conclude she is not small.\n   - Premise (24) states that Sally is a brimpus, and Premise (23) states that each brimpus is windy. However, there is no direct link between brimpuses and jompuses directly. We need to connect shumpuses and jompuses.\n   - Premise (1) states: \"If Sally is not small then Taylor is a visionary.\" So, we need to show that Sally is not small.\n\n4. **Connecting Shumpuses and Jompuses:**\n   - Premise (25) states that Sally is a shumpus.\n   - Premise (2) states that each shumpus is an impus.\n   - Premise (7) states that every impus is a zumpus.\n   - Premise (8) states that each zumpus is a dumpus.\n   - Premise (11) states that each shumpus is not dull.\n   - Premise (19) states that each jompus is not small.\n   - Premise (15) states that each jompus is a lorpus.\n   - Premise (14) states that each zumpus is hot.\n   - Premise (9) states that each wumpus is not loud.\n   - Premise (10) states that each lorpus is kind.\n   - Premise (13) states that each tumpus is a grimpus.\n   - Premise (12) states that each tumpus is not nervous.\n   - Premise (16) states that tumpuses are lempuses.\n   - Premise (17) states that brimpuses are numpuses.\n   - Premise (18) states that impuses are rompuses.\n   - Premise (21) states that each rompus is transparent.\n   - Premise (22) states that each brimpus is windy.\n   - Premise (23) states that each brimpus is windy.\n   - Premise (24) states that Sally is a brimpus.\n   - Premise (25) states that Sally is a shumpus.\n\n5. **Deriving the Conclusion:**\n   - From Premise (25), Sally is a shumpus.\n   - From Premise (2), each shumpus is an impus.\n   - From Premise (7), every impus is a zumpus.\n   - From Premise (14), each zumpus is hot.\n   - From Premise (15), each jompus is a lorpus.\n   - From Premise (19), each jompus is not small.\n   - From Premise (25), Sally is a shumpus, and since shumpuses are not small (Premise 11), Sally is not small.\n   - From Premise (1), if Sally is not small, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises leading to the conclusion that Taylor is a visionary is:\n- Premise (1): If Sally is not small then Taylor is a visionary.\n- Premise (25): Sally is a shumpus.\n- Premise (11): Each shumpus is not dull.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n(1),(25),(11)->(26)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(25),(11)->(26)"}]
