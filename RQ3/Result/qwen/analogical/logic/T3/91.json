Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:** \n1. Everything that is large, small, or a yumpus is a wumpus.\n2. Everything that is dull, bright, or a lempus is a lempus.\n3. Everything that is orange or blue or a rompus is a grimpus.\n4. Everything that is kind, angry, or a grimpus is a yumpus.\n5. Everything that is transparent or opaque or a grimpus is a zumpus.\n6. Everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus.\n7. Everything that is happy, shy, or a jompus is a tumpus.\n8. Everything that is sour or bitter or a shumpus is an impus.\n9. Everything that is fruity, floral, or a jompus is a gorpus.\n10. Everything that is overcast, sunny, or a vumpus is a sterpus.\n11. Everything that is moderate or slow or a vumpus is a jompus.\n12. Fae is a grimpus.\n13. Fae is a shumpus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:**\nProve: (14) Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From Premise 12, Fae is a grimpus.\n- From Premise 3, everything that is orange or blue or a rompus is a grimpus. Since Fae is a grimpus, it does not directly help us conclude about Fae being luminous, metallic, or a yumpus.\n- From Premise 8, everything that is sour or bitter or a shumpus is an impus. Since Fae is a shumpus (Premise 13), Fae is also an impus.\n- From Premise 4, everything that is kind, angry, or a grimpus is a yumpus. Since Fae is a grimpus, we can conclude that Fae is a yumpus.\n- From Premise 6, everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus. Since Fae is a yumpus, we can conclude that Fae is a vumpus.\n- From Premise 10, everything that is overcast, sunny, or a vumpus is a sterpus. Since Fae is a vumpus, it does not directly help us conclude about Fae being luminous, metallic, or a yumpus.\n- From Premise 11, everything that is moderate or slow or a vumpus is a jompus. Since Fae is a vumpus, it does not directly help us conclude about Fae being luminous, metallic, or a yumpus.\n- Therefore, we can conclude that Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus since Fae is a yumpus.\n\nThus, the solution for Problem 1 is: **(12),(13)->(14)**\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**\n1.

Since Fae is a grimpus, it does not directly help us conclude about Fae being luminous, metallic, or a yumpus.\n- From Premise 8, everything that is sour or bitter or a shumpus is an impus.

Since Fae is a yumpus, we can conclude that Fae is a vumpus.\n- From Premise 10, everything that is overcast, sunny, or a vumpus is a sterpus. Since Fae is a vumpus, it does not directly help us conclude about Fae being luminous, metallic, or a yumpus.\n- From Premise 11, everything that is moderate or slow or a vumpus is a jompus.
