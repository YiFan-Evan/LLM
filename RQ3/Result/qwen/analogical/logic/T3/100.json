Here\u2019s how we can break down the problem:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) If Stella is melodic then Taylor is a visionary.  \n(12) Stella is a zumpus.  \n(11) Zumpuses are not opaque.  \n\n**Prove:**  \n(14) Taylor is a visionary.  \n\n**Solution:**  \nThe premises provided do not directly link Stella being melodic to her being a zumpus or vice versa. Thus, we cannot use the information about Stella being a zumpus to conclude anything about her melodic nature or Taylor being a visionary based solely on these premises. This problem doesn't lead us to the desired conclusion.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) If Stella is melodic then Taylor is a visionary.  \n(13) Stella is a dumpus.  \n(10) Dumpuses are small.  \n\n**Prove:**  \n(14) Taylor is a visionary.  \n\n**Solution:**  \nAgain, the premises provided do not establish a direct link between Stella being melodic and her being a dumpus or smallness. Hence, we cannot use the information about Stella being a dumpus or small to conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) If Stella is melodic then Taylor is a visionary.  \n(13) Stella is a dumpus.  \n(7) Each dumpus is a lempus.  \n(4) Lempuses are sunny.  \n(8) Gorpuses are melodic.  \n(3) Every dumpus is a gorpus.  \n(6) Gorpuses are grimpuses.  \n(5) Every grimpus is not moderate.  \n\n**Prove:**  \n(14) Taylor is a visionary.  \n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom premise (13), Stella is a dumpus.  \nFrom premise (3), every dumpus is a gorpus, so Stella is a gorpus.  \nFrom premise (6), gorpuses are grimpuses, so Stella is a grimpus.  \nFrom premise (5), every grimpus is not moderate, so Stella is not moderate.  \nFrom premise (7), each dumpus is a lempus, so Stella is a lempus.  \nFrom premise (4), lempuses are sunny, so Stella is sunny.  \nHowever, none of these premises directly state that Stella is melodic. We need to find a connection to Stella being melodic.  \nFrom premise (8), gorpuses are melodic, and since Stella is a gorpus, Stella is melodic.  \nFinally, from premise (1), if Stella is melodic, then Taylor is a visionary. Since Stella is melodic, Taylor is a visionary.\n\n**Answer:** (13),(3),(6),(8),(1)->(14)\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (13),(3),(6),(8),(1)->(14)"}]
