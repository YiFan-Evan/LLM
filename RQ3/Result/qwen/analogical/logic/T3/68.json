Therefore, Alex is a numpus.\n3. From Premise (10): Alex is a yumpus.\n4. From Premise (4): Alex is a sterpus.\n5. From Premises (11) and (12), Alex is both a numpus and a dumpus. Therefore, Alex is a numpus (redundant but consistent).\n6. From Premises (12) and (13): Alex is a dumpus and a vumpus.\n7. From Premises (13) and (7): Alex is a vumpus and vumpuses are tumpuses. Therefore, Alex is a tumpus.\n8. From Premises (14) and (6): Alex is a jompus and Alex is a lorpus. From Premise (6), lorpus implies grimpus. So, Alex is a grimpus.\n9. From Premises (11), (12), (13), (14), and (15), Alex is a numpus, a tumpus, and a grimpus.\n10. From Premise (2): Everything that is a numpus and a tumpus and a grimpus is a lempus. Therefore, Alex is a lempus.\n11. From Premise (1): If Alex is a lempus, then Taylor is a visionary. Since Alex is a lempus, Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Taylor is a visionary is:\n- (1) If Alex is a lempus then Taylor is a visionary.\n- (2) Everything that is a numpus and a tumpus and a grimpus is a lempus.\n- (12) Alex is a dumpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed is (1), (2), and (12).\n\n**Answer:** (1),(2),(12)->(16)"}]
