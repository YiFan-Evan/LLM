Let's break it down step-by-step:\n\n### Problem Description:\nWe need to prove that Taylor is a visionary based on the given premises. According to the premises, the only way to establish that Taylor is a visionary is through premise (1):\n\n(1) If Alex is metallic and a jompus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTo use this premise, we need to prove that Alex is metallic and a jompus. This involves combining several other premises together.\n\n### Steps to Derive Alex is Metallic and a Jompus:\n1. From (11): Alex is metallic.\n2. To show Alex is a jompus, we need to find a chain of reasoning leading to this conclusion using other premises.\n\nFrom (17) and (5):\n- (17) Alex is a brimpus.\n- (5) If Alex is metallic and a jompus, then Alex is a lorpus.\n- To connect Alex being a brimpus to being a jompus, we need to trace back from (17) to (5).\n\nFrom (13) and (4):\n- (13) Alex is cold.\n- (4) If Alex is cold and a sterpus, then Alex is a brimpus.\n- Since Alex is a brimpus (from (17)), we know he is cold (from (13)) and also a sterpus (from (18)).\n\nFrom (18) and (7):\n- (18) Alex is a sterpus.\n- (7) If Alex is mean and a sterpus, then Alex is a wumpus.\n- This doesn't help directly but confirms sterpus status.\n\nFrom (16) and (9):\n- (16) Alex is blue.\n- (9) If Alex is blue and a brimpus, then Alex is a jompus.\n- Therefore, Alex is blue and a brimpus, so Alex is a jompus.\n\n### Final Derivation:\n- From (11): Alex is metallic.\n- From (16) and (9): Alex is a jompus.\n- Thus, Alex is metallic and a jompus.\n\nUsing premise (1):\n- (1) If Alex is metallic and a jompus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n- Since Alex is metallic and a jompus, Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThe minimal set of premises required to derive (19) is (1), (11), (16), and (9).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(11),(16),(9)->(19)**."}]
