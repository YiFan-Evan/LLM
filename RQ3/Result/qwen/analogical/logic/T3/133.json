If Polly is not a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.\n2. Everything that is a vumpus, a jompus, or a dumpus is a rompus.\n3. Everything that is a vumpus or a sterpus or an impus is a zumpus.\n4.

From Premise 10, each lorpus is a lempus. Since Polly is a lorpus, Polly is a lempus.\n4. From Premise 11, Polly is a lempus, an impus, and a gorpus. We already know Polly is an impus from step 2.\n5. From Premise 6, Polly is a zumpus.\n6. From Premise 8, each zumpus is a rompus. Since Polly is a zumpus, Polly is a rompus.\n7. From Premise 9, lorpuses are not rompuses. Since Polly is a lorpus, Polly cannot be a rompus, leading to a contradiction.\n8. Since Polly cannot be a rompus due to being a lorpus, and Polly is already established as a zumpus (which implies being a rompus), this contradiction suggests that Polly cannot be a lorpus and thus cannot be a vumpus.\n9. Since Polly is not a vumpus, from Premise 1, Taylor must be a visionary.\n\n**Answer:**\n(1),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(12)->(13)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(12)->(13)"}]
