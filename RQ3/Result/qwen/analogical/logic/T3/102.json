We need to show that Wren fulfills the condition specified in premise (1) to prove that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Premises:\n1. If Wren is happy and nervous and shy and feisty and a gorpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n2. Everything that is discordant and muffled and melodic and loud and a jompus is a numpus.\n3. Everything that is happy and nervous and shy and feisty and a gorpus is a brimpus.\n4. Everything that is transparent and opaque and a rompus is a vumpus.\n5.
