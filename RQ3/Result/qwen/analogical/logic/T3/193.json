(24) Rex is a dumpus.]\n\n**Proof Obligation:** (25) Rex is not feisty.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (24), Rex is a dumpus.\n- We need to establish a connection between dumpus and shumpus or any other class that Rex belongs to which directly or indirectly implies Rex is not feisty.\n- However, there is no direct or indirect relationship between dumpus and shumpus or any other class that would help us conclude Rex is not feisty using just these two premises.\n\nThus, the solution for Problem 1 is **none**, since we cannot prove Rex is not feisty with just these two premises.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:** [(1) Each shumpus is not feisty. (12) Jompuses are shumpuses. (14) Grimpuses are jompuses.
