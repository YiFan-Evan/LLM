Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and consider different scenarios.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:**\n- (1) Everything that is orange and a wumpus is a zumpus.\n- (2) Everything that is rainy and a dumpus is a vumpus.\n- (3) Everything that is opaque and a brimpus is a dumpus.\n- (4) Everything that is fruity and a brimpus is a jompus.\n- (5) Everything that is melodic and a sterpus is a lempus.\n- (6) Everything that is kind and a sterpus is a brimpus.\n- (7) Everything that is metallic and a dumpus is a numpus.\n- (8) Sally is a brimpus.\n- (9) Sally is a wumpus.\n- (10) Sally is melodic.\n- (11) Sally is opaque.\n- (12) Sally is rainy.\n- (13) Sally is kind.\n- (14) Sally is fruity.\n- (15) Sally is a sterpus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:**\n- (16) Sally is rainy and a dumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom (11), Sally is opaque. From (8), Sally is a brimpus. By combining (3) and (11), we conclude that Sally is a dumpus. Since Sally is also rainy (from (12)), we can conclude that Sally is rainy and a dumpus.

From (6), since Sally is kind and a sterpus, she is also a brimpus. From (8), Sally is already a brimpus. Combining (3) and (11), we get that Sally is a dumpus. Since Sally is also rainy (from (12)), we conclude that Sally is rainy and a dumpus.
