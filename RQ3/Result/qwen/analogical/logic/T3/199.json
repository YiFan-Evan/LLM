Therefore, Polly is a vumpus, a sterpus, and a brimpus.  \nFrom premise (6), every sterpus is a gorpus, so Polly is a gorpus.  \nFrom premise (5), vumpuses are rompuses, so Polly is a vumpus and a rompus.  \nFrom premise (3), everything that is a vumpus, a grimpus, or a brimpus is a lempus. Since Polly is a vumpus and a brimpus, Polly is a lempus.  \nSince Polly is a lempus, she satisfies the condition of being a lempus or a yumpus.  \nTherefore, the answer is: **(10)->(11)**\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is a lorpus, a brimpus, or a jompus is a shumpus.  \n(2) Every wumpus is a vumpus and a sterpus and a brimpus.  \n(3) Everything that is a vumpus, a grimpus, or a brimpus is a lempus.  \n(4) Everything that is a lempus or a jompus or a lorpus is a dumpus.  \n(5) Vumpuses are rompuses.  \n(6) Every sterpus is a gorpus.  \n(7) Everything that is a vumpus, a grimpus, or a brimpus is a dumpus.  \n(8) Wumpuses are shumpuses.  \n(9) Polly is a rompus.  \n(10) Polly is a wumpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(11) Polly is a lempus or a zumpus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom premise (10), Polly is a wumpus.  \nFrom premise (2), every wumpus is a vumpus, a sterpus, and a brimpus.
