Specifically, Alex is aggressive and angry, and also a shumpus. We need to show that these attributes satisfy the conditions to make Alex a grimpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (14) and (13), we know Alex is angry and aggressive.\n- From (15), we know Alex is a shumpus.\n- Therefore, using premise (1), Alex is a grimpus.\n\nSo, the answer is: (14),(13),(15)->(16)\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** \nAlex is described as being snowy and windy, which implies he is a lorpus. However, this problem focuses on the attributes that directly make him a grimpus. Since Alex is a lempus (from (12)), it does not contribute to proving he is a grimpus directly but could be used to infer other properties.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (10) and (11), we know Alex is windy and snowy.\n- From (15), we know Alex is a shumpus.\n- Using premise (3), Alex would be a lorpus if he were snowy and windy and a shumpus, but this doesn't help us prove he is a grimpus directly.\n- Instead, we use (14) and (13) to show Alex is angry and aggressive.\n- Therefore, using premise (1), Alex is a grimpus.\n\nSo, the answer is: (14),(13),(15)->(16)\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** \nThis problem focuses on showing that Alex is a grimpus through his attributes of being orange and red, and his status as a grimpus. However, since Alex is already proven to be a grimpus from his anger and aggression, this problem is redundant but we can still show it through the provided attributes.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (8) and (9), we know Alex is orange and red.\n- From (13) and (14), we know Alex is aggressive and angry.\n- From (15), we know Alex is a shumpus.\n- Therefore, using premise (1), Alex is a grimpus.\n\nSo, the answer is: (8),(9),(13),(14),(15)->(16)\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (14),(13),(15)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Alex is orange and red and a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.
