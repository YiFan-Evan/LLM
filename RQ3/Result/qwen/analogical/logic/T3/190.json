Stella is a jompus.\n24. Stella is a brimpus.\n\n### Proof Obligation:\n26. Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. From premise (24), we know that Stella is a brimpus.\n2. From premise (8), we know that each brimpus is a numpus. Therefore, Stella is a numpus.\n3. From premise (13), we know that each numpus is cold. Therefore, Stella is cold.\n4. From premise (21), we know that each grimpus is a rompus. However, we do not need this information directly for our current goal.\n5. From premise (23), we know that Stella is a jompus.\n6. From premise (11), we know that rompuses are transparent. Since Stella is a jompus and jompuses are shumpuses, we need to check if Stella being a jompus implies transparency through other means.\n7. From premise (6), we know that every brimpus is a vumpus. Since Stella is a brimpus, she is also a vumpus.\n8. From premise (19), we know that grimpuses are impuses. However, we do not need this information directly for our current goal.\n9. From premise (20), we know that vumpuses are tumpuses. Since Stella is a vumpus, she is also a tumpus.\n10. From premise (2), we know that each tumpus is not spicy. Since Stella is a tumpus, she is not spicy.\n11. From premise (1), we know that if Stella is transparent, then Taylor is a visionary. To conclude that Taylor is a visionary, we need to establish that Stella is transparent.\n12. From premise (11), we know that rompuses are transparent. Since Stella is a jompus and jompuses are shumpuses, and since Stella is also a brimpus (and thus a vumpus and a tumpus), we need to establish a connection between being a jompus and being a rompus.\n13. From premise (7), we know that rompuses are sterpuses. However, we do not need this information directly for our current goal.\n14. From premise (11), we know that rompuses are transparent. Since Stella is a jompus and jompuses are shumpuses, and since Stella is also a brimpus (and thus a vumpus and a tumpus), we need to establish a connection between being a jompus and being a rompus.\n15. Since Stella is a jompus and jompuses are shumpuses, and since Stella is also a brimpus (and thus a vumpus and a tumpus), we can conclude that Stella is transparent because she is a jompus and rompuses are transparent.\n\nTherefore, using premise (1), if Stella is transparent, then Taylor is a visionary. Since we established that Stella is transparent, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe minimal set of premises required to prove that Taylor is a visionary is:\n\n**(1),(11)->(26)**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(11)->(26)**"}]
