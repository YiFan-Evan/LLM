The key premise here is:\n\n(1) If Stella is mean and a numpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nSo, we need to show that Stella is mean and a numpus. We have several premises about Stella's attributes, and we need to combine them correctly.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Premise (16): Stella is mean.**\n   - This tells us one part of what we need.\n   \n2. **Premise (15): Stella is dull.**\n   - This doesn't directly help us prove Stella is a numpus, but it might be useful later.\n\n3. **Premise (8): Everything that is dull and a gorpus is a numpus.**\n   - Combining this with Premise (10) (Stella is a gorpus) and Premise (15) (Stella is dull):\n     - Stella is dull and a gorpus, so by (8), Stella is a numpus.\n\nNow we have shown that Stella is both mean and a numpus, so we can use Premise (1) to conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Taylor is a visionary is:\n\n- Premise (1) (If Stella is mean and a numpus, then Taylor is a visionary).\n- Premise (15) (Stella is dull).\n- Premise (10) (Stella is a gorpus).\n- Premise (16) (Stella is mean).\n\nCombining these, we get:\n\n**Premise (8)** (Everything that is dull and a gorpus is a numpus) + Premise (10) + Premise (15) gives us that Stella is a numpus. Then Premise (16) + Premise (10) + Premise (15) + Premise (8) gives us Stella is mean and a numpus, and thus Premise (1) gives us that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Final Answer:\n(1),(10),(15),(16)->(17)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(1),(10),(15),(16)->(17)"}]
