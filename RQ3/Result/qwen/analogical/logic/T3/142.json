If Stella is not a gorpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n2. Stella is a zumpus.\n3. Each tumpus is a wumpus.\n4. Each sterpus is a wumpus.\n5. Jompuses are zumpuses.\n6. Impuses are wumpuses.\n7.

From premise (13), we know that Stella is not a lorpus.\n2. From premise (11), we know that every gorpus is an impus.\n3. From premise (8), we know that every impus is a lorpus.\n4. Since Stella is not a lorpus (from (13)) and every gorpus is an impus (from (11)), and every impus is a lorpus (from (8)), it follows that Stella cannot be a gorpus.\n5. From premise (1), if Stella is not a gorpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n6. Since we have established that Stella is not a gorpus, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Taylor is a visionary is (13) and (1).\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (13),(1)->(14)"}]
