According to (1), since Fae is a gorpus, Fae must also be a jompus. Therefore, the proof obligation (9) is true.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**\n- (2) Everything that is blue or a jompus is a wumpus.\n- (8) Fae is a gorpus.\n- (1) Everything that is earthy or a gorpus is a jompus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:**\n- (10) Fae is blue or a jompus.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe already established in Problem 1 that Fae is a jompus because Fae is a gorpus and (1) tells us that everything that is a gorpus is a jompus. Since Fae is a jompus, it satisfies the condition \"Fae is blue or a jompus\" because one of the conditions (being a jompus) is true.

According to (5), if something is a shumpus, it is a grimpus. Therefore, Fae is a grimpus. However, this problem does not directly help us prove (10), so it is not relevant to the current proof obligation.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Fae is blue or a jompus is (8) and (1).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(1)->(10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Fae is blue or a jompus then Taylor is a visionary.
