The key premise here is:\n- (1) If Sam is a gorpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nWe need to establish that Sam is a gorpus. We can do this by showing that Sam meets the criteria of being a gorpus.\n\n### Steps to Derive the Conclusion:\n\n1. From premise (10): Sam is sour, a jompus, and a tumpus.\n2. From premise (8): Every dumpus is sour, a tumpus, and a jompus.\n   - Since Sam is sour, a jompus, and a tumpus, Sam must be a dumpus.\n3. From premise (3): Gorpuses are large and dumpuses and sterpuses.\n   - Since Sam is a dumpus, and all gorpuses are dumpuses, Sam could potentially be a gorpus.\n4. From premise (6): Yumpuses are dull and zumpuses and brimpuses.\n5. From premise (11): Sam is floral, a wumpus, and a yumpus.\n   - Since Sam is a yumpus, he is also dull and a zumpus or brimpus.\n6. From premise (5): Yumpuses are dull and zumpuses and brimpuses.\n   - This confirms that Sam is indeed a yumpus.\n7. From premise (4): Wumpuses are shy and gorpuses and yumpuses.\n   - Since Sam is a wumpus, he is also shy.\n8. From premise (7): Every impus is floral and a shumpus and a wumpus.\n9. From premise (9): Each lempus is discordant and an impus.\n10. From premise (6): Yumpuses are dull and zumpuses and brimpuses.\n11. From premise (3): Gorpuses are large and dumpuses and sterpuses.\n    - Since Sam is a dumpus, and all gorpuses are dumpuses, Sam could potentially be a gorpus.\n12. From premise (1): If Sam is a gorpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n    - Since Sam is a gorpus, Taylor must be a visionary.\n\nThus, the logical steps lead us to conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(10),(8),(3),(1)->(12)**"}]
