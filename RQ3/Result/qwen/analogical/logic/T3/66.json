Premise (1) states that if Rex is kind or a rompus, then Taylor is a visionary. Since we do not have any direct information about Rex being kind or a rompus from the given premises except the fact that Rex is a gorpus and a sterpus, we need to consider the structure of the proof more carefully.\n   - Given that we need Rex to be kind or a rompus, and there is no direct way to infer this from the given premises without additional assumptions, we must rely on the structure of the proof.
