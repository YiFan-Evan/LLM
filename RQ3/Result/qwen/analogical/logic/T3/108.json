Therefore, we don't need any other premises to prove this.\n\n**Problem 2:** Given the same premises, prove that Polly is a gorpus.\n- **Solution:** We know from premise (9) that Polly is a lempus. According to premise (2), everything that is dull or a lempus is a gorpus. Since Polly is a lempus, she is also a gorpus.\n\n**Problem 3:** Given the same premises, prove that Polly is a grimpus.\n- **Solution:** From premise (8), Polly is a shumpus. According to premise (4), everything that is earthy or a shumpus is a grimpus. Since Polly is a shumpus, she could be a grimpus if she were earthy, but we don't have information about her being earthy directly. However, since we need to prove Polly is large or a grimpus, we can use another route.\n\nNow, let's derive the final proof:\n\nFrom premise (8), Polly is a shumpus. According to premise (4), everything that is earthy or a shumpus is a grimpus. Thus, Polly is a grimpus if she is not earthy. If Polly is not a grimpus, then we need to check the other condition. From premise (5), everything that is large or a grimpus is a tumpus. If Polly is not a grimpus, we need to check if she is large. But we don't have direct information about Polly being large or not. However, since Polly is a shumpus and shumpuses are either grimpuses or large, we conclude that Polly must be large or a grimpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Polly is large or a grimpus is (8) and (4).\n\nThe final answer is: **(8),(4)->(10)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is large or a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.

According to premise (5), everything that is earthy or a shumpus is a grimpus. So, Polly is a grimpus if she is earthy. However, we don't have direct information about Polly being earthy. Alternatively, from premise (6), everything that is large or a grimpus is a tumpus. Since Polly is a shumpus, we need to check if she is large or a grimpus. Since we don't have direct information about Polly being large, we need to consider both possibilities.\n\nGiven these points, we can now derive the final proof:\n\nSince Polly is a shumpus (premise (9)), and from premise (5), everything that is earthy or a shumpus is a grimpus, Polly could be a grimpus if she is earthy. However, we do not have direct evidence of Polly being earthy. Alternatively, from premise (6), everything that is large or a grimpus is a tumpus. Therefore, Polly must be either large or a grimpus to satisfy premise (6). \n\nThus, Polly is either large or a grimpus, which means Taylor is a visionary according to premise (1).\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Taylor is a visionary is (9) and (5) or (6).\n\nThe final answer is: **(9),(5)->(11)** or **(9),(6)->(11)**\n\nHowever, since we need the minimal set that directly proves Polly is large or a grimpus, we can combine (9) and (6):\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(9),(6)->(11)**"}]
