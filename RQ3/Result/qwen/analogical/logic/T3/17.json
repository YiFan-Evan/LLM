From (15), dumpuses are dull, so Max is dull.\n5. From (9), every wumpus is not moderate, and from (21), every wumpus is a lorpus, so every lorpus is not moderate.\n6. From (20), Lempuses are zumpuses, and from (22), zumpuses are shumpuses, so Lempuses are shumpuses.\n7. From (4), each shumpus is not sweet, and since Max is a lempus (from (13)), Max is not sweet.\n8. However, the key point is that Max is not moderate because Max is a wumpus (since Lempuses are zumpuses and zumpuses are wumpuses).\n9.
