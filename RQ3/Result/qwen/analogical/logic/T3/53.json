Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus is a brimpus.\n2. Max is a yumpus.\n3. Max is a wumpus.\n4. Everything that is a sterpus, a numpus, or a shumpus is a grimpus.\n5. Everything that is a sterpus, a numpus, or a shumpus is a brimpus.\n6. Max is an impus.\n7. Every wumpus is a grimpus.\n8. Everything that is a dumpus, a numpus, or a vumpus is a rompus.\n9. Max is a lempus.\n10. Everything that is a yumpus, an impus, and a lempus is a vumpus.\n11. Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus is not a grimpus.\n12. Max is a yumpus.\n13. Max is a brimpus.\n14. Max is a tumpus.\n15. Max is a lorpus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:**\n16. Max is not a numpus.\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom premises (12), (14), and (15), we can conclude that Max is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus. According to premise (1), everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus is a brimpus. Therefore, Max is a brimpus. This is consistent with premise (13).\n\nAccording to premise (11), everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus is not a grimpus. Since Max is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus, Max cannot be a grimpus.\n\nFrom premise (7), every wumpus is a grimpus. Since Max is a wumpus (premise 3), Max would be a grimpus if he were a wumpus. However, since Max cannot be a grimpus (from premise (11)), Max cannot be a wumpus. This contradicts premise (3), so we need to focus on other aspects.\n\nPremise (6) states that Max is an impus. Premise (10) states that everything that is a yumpus, an impus, and a lempus is a vumpus. Since Max is a yumpus and a lempus (premises 2 and 9), Max is a vumpus. \n\nPremise (8) states that everything that is a dumpus, a numpus, or a vumpus is a rompus. If Max were a numpus, then Max would be a rompus. However, there is no information that directly links Max to being a rompus, so we need to check if Max could be a numpus.\n\nSince Max is a brimpus (premise 13) and a brimpus is not a grimpus (from premise (11)), and since a grimpus is necessary to be a numpus (from premises (4) and (5)), Max cannot be a numpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is not a numpus is (12), (14), (15), (11), (6), and (10).\n\nThe answer is: (12),(14),(15),(11),(6),(10)->(16)\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**\n1.

Max is a brimpus.\n14. Max is a tumpus.\n15. Max is a lorpus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:**\n16. Max is not a numpus.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe already know from the previous analysis that Max is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus. From premise (1), Max is a brimpus. From premise (11), Max cannot be a grimpus. Since Max is a wumpus (premise 3) and every wumpus is a grimpus (premise 7), this creates a contradiction unless Max is not a wumpus. But premise (3) still stands, so we need to focus on other aspects.\n\nMax is a brimpus and not a grimpus, so Max cannot be a numpus because a numpus would make Max a grimpus (from premises (4) and (5)). Therefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is not a numpus is (12), (14), (15), (11), (6), and (10).\n\nThe answer is: (12),(14),(15),(11),(6),(10)->(16)\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**\n1.
