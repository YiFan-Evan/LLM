From (16), (20), and (21), we can conclude that Rex is a shumpus because everything that is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus is a shumpus.\n2. From (14), we know that shumpuses are not impuses.\n3. From (3), we know that every wumpus is a lempus and a gorpus and an impus.\n4. From (12), we know that lempuses are wumpuses.\n5. From (3) and (12), we know that every lempus is an impus.\n6. From (13), we know that Rex is an impus since each sterpus is an impus.\n7. If Rex were a lempus, he would be an impus (from (3) and (12)).\n8. But Rex is a shumpus (from (16), (20), and (21)), and shumpuses are not impuses (from (14)).\n9. Therefore, Rex cannot be a lempus.\n\nSince Rex is not a lempus, according to premise (1), Taylor must be a visionary.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed is (1), (16), (20), (21), (13), and (14).\n\n**Answer:** (1),(16),(20),(21),(13),(14)->(22)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(16),(20),(21),(13),(14)->(22)"}]
