Next, we need to show that Wren is liquid, luminous, and wooden. Premise (7) tells us that everything that is liquid, luminous, and wooden and a dumpus is a numpus. Since Wren is already established to be a dumpus, we only need to confirm that Wren is liquid, luminous, and wooden:  \n- (10) Wren is liquid.\n- (15) Wren is luminous.\n- (11) Wren is wooden.\n\nThus, Wren is liquid, luminous, and wooden, making it a numpus.
