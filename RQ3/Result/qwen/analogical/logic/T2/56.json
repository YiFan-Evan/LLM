Since Sam is a tumpus, Sam could be a lempus if Sam is not red, but this does not directly help us prove (8).\n- From (7), we know Sam is also a jompus.\n- From (2), everything that is bright or a jompus is a numpus. Since Sam is a jompus, Sam is a numpus.\n- Therefore, since Sam is a numpus, it follows that Sam is rainy or a numpus (since being a numpus satisfies the condition).\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (8) is (2) and (7).\n\n**Answer:**  \n(2),(7)->(8)\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is rainy or a numpus is a grimpus.  \n(2) Everything that is bright or a jompus is a numpus.  \n(3) Everything that is red or a tumpus is a lempus.  \n(4) Everything that is amenable or a numpus is a lorpus.  \n(5) Everything that is sour or a jompus is a vumpus.  \n(6) Sam is a tumpus.  \n(7) Sam is a jompus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(9) Sam is a lorpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (6), we know Sam is a tumpus.\n- From (7), we know Sam is a jompus.\n- From (2), everything that is bright or a jompus is a numpus. Since Sam is a jompus, Sam is a numpus.\n- From (4), everything that is amenable or a numpus is a lorpus. Since Sam is a numpus, Sam could be a lorpus if Sam is amenable, but this does not directly help us prove (9).\n- However, we do not have any information about whether Sam is amenable or not. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sam is a lorpus.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (9) is insufficient based on the given premises.\n\n**Answer:**  \nNone of the premises can directly prove (9).\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is rainy or a numpus is a grimpus.  \n(2) Everything that is bright or a jompus is a numpus.  \n(3) Everything that is red or a tumpus is a lempus.  \n(4) Everything that is amenable or a numpus is a lorpus.  \n(5) Everything that is sour or a jompus is a vumpus.  \n(6) Sam is a tumpus.  \n(7) Sam is a jompus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(10) Sam is a grimpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (6), we know Sam is a tumpus.\n- From (7), we know Sam is a jompus.\n- From (2), everything that is bright or a jompus is a numpus.
