We need to prove that Rex is a lorpus based on the premises about what constitutes a lorpus.\n\n**Premises:**\n(1) Everything that is mean, amenable, angry, aggressive, and a shumpus is a lorpus.\n(8) Rex is mean.\n(9) Rex is a shumpus.\n(18) Rex is angry.\n(19) Rex is amenable.\n(20) Rex is aggressive.\n\n**Solution:**\nTo prove Rex is a lorpus, we use the fact that Rex is a shumpus and has all the attributes required to be a lorpus (mean, amenable, angry, aggressive).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(9),(18),(19),(20)->(21)\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** \nHere, we introduce new premises related to Rex being a lempus, but the proof still revolves around proving Rex is a lorpus.\n\n**Premises:**\n(1) Everything that is mean, amenable, angry, aggressive, and a shumpus is a lorpus.\n(8) Rex is mean.\n(9) Rex is a shumpus.\n(18) Rex is angry.\n(19) Rex is amenable.\n(20) Rex is aggressive.\n(11) Rex is a lempus.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe premise (11) is irrelevant to proving Rex is a lorpus because it does not contribute any necessary attributes for Rex to be a lorpus. We still use the same premises as in Problem 1 to prove Rex is a lorpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(9),(18),(19),(20)->(21)\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** \nIn this variation, we add more attributes to Rex, but the proof remains focused on showing Rex is a lorpus.\n\n**Premises:**\n(1) Everything that is mean, amenable, angry, aggressive, and a shumpus is a lorpus.\n(8) Rex is mean.\n(9) Rex is a shumpus.\n(18) Rex is angry.\n(19) Rex is amenable.\n(20) Rex is aggressive.\n(10) Rex is metallic.\n(12) Rex is luminous.\n(13) Rex is liquid.\n(17) Rex is wooden.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe additional attributes (metallic, luminous, liquid, wooden) do not affect the proof since they are not required for Rex to be a lorpus.
