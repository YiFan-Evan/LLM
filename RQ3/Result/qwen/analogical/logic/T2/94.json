From (1), since Max is a vumpus, he is also a lorpus. However, this does not directly help us with proving (8). Instead, we use (5) and (6): Since Max is a grimpus, (5) tells us that Max is a tumpus. Therefore, Max is definitely a tumpus, which means he satisfies the condition \"sour or a tumpus\" because being a tumpus is sufficient to satisfy the disjunction. Hence, the minimal set of premises needed is (5), (6), and (7).\n\n**Answer:**  \n(5),(6),(7)->(8)\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is liquid or a vumpus is a lorpus.  \n(2) Everything that is dull or a grimpus is a dumpus.  \n(3) Everything that is melodic or a tumpus is an impus.  \n(4) Everything that is sour or a tumpus is a gorpus.  \n(5) Everything that is shy or a grimpus is a tumpus.  \n(6) Max is a grimpus.  \n(7) Max is a vumpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \nProve: (8) Max is sour or a tumpus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe can follow the same reasoning as above. Since Max is a grimpus (6), (5) tells us that Max is a tumpus. Thus, Max is certainly a tumpus, satisfying the condition \"sour or a tumpus.\" Therefore, the minimal set of premises needed is (5), (6), and (7).\n\n**Answer:**  \n(5),(6),(7)->(8)\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is liquid or a vumpus is a lorpus.  \n(2) Everything that is dull or a grimpus is a dumpus.  \n(3) Everything that is melodic or a tumpus is an impus.  \n(4) Everything that is sour or a tumpus is a gorpus.  \n(5) Everything that is shy or a grimpus is a tumpus.  \n(6) Max is a grimpus.  \n(7) Max is a vumpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \nProve: (8) Max is sour or a tumpus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nAgain, since Max is a grimpus (6), (5) tells us that Max is a tumpus. Therefore, Max is a tumpus, satisfying the condition \"sour or a tumpus.\" The minimal set of premises needed is (5), (6), and (7).\n\n**Answer:**  \n(5),(6),(7)->(8)\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (5),(6),(7)->(8)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a vumpus.
