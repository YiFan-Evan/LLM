Here we need to prove that Rex is either transparent or a jompus.\n\n**Solution:** \n\nFrom (4), we know that everything that is spicy or a numpus is a jompus. Since Rex is a numpus (from (10)), it follows that Rex is a jompus.\n\nSince Rex is also a rompus (from (11)) and from (2), everything that is small or a rompus is a wumpus, we do not need to directly use (2) to derive (12) since we already have Rex as a jompus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (12) is (4),(10)->(12).\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** Similar to Problem 1, but instead of proving Rex is transparent or a jompus, we need to prove Rex is either a jompus or transparent.\n\n**Solution:** \n\nThis is essentially the same logical structure as Problem 1. From (4), since Rex is a numpus (from (10)), Rex is a jompus. Thus, Rex is already a jompus, which satisfies the condition of being a jompus or transparent without needing to derive transparency directly.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (12) is (4),(10)->(12).\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** We need to prove that Rex is either transparent or a jompus using a different logical pathway.\n\n**Solution:** \n\nWe know from (10) that Rex is a numpus. From (4), everything that is spicy or a numpus is a jompus, so Rex is a jompus. This means Rex is a jompus, which satisfies the condition of (12) without needing to derive transparency directly.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (12) is (4),(10)->(12).\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (4),(10)->(12)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a rompus.
