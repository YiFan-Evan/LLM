Let's analyze the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Analysis:\nWe need to show that Sally is dull using the given premises. Here's the logical path:\n\n1. From premise (1), Sally is a grimpus.\n2. From premise (13), every grimpus is a brimpus. Therefore, Sally is a brimpus.\n3. From premise (4), every brimpus is a rompus. Therefore, Sally is a rompus.\n4. From premise (15), rompuses are dull. Therefore, Sally is dull.\n\nNow, let's verify if we need all the other premises or if these are sufficient.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe key steps involve establishing that Sally is a brimpus and then using the fact that rompuses are dull. We don't need premises about being fast, being not sweet, being not metallic, being windy, or being large for this specific proof.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed is:\n- (1) Sally is a grimpus.\n- (13) Every grimpus is a brimpus.\n- (4) Every brimpus is a rompus.\n- (15) Rompuses are dull.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises leading to the conclusion is: **(1),(13),(4),(15)->(17)**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(13),(4),(15)->(17)**"}]
