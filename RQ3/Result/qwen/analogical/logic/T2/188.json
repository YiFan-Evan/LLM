Let's create three related but not identical problems based on the given premises.\n\n### Problem 1:\nPremises: \n(1) Everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is a wumpus and a rompus and a zumpus.\n(2) Everything that is a wumpus, a shumpus, or a sterpus is an impus.\n(3) Rompuses are impuses.\n(4) Everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is an impus.\n(5) Each jompus is a grimpus.\n(6) Jompuses are impuses.\n(7) Everything that is a grimpus, a sterpus, or a lempus is a numpus.\n(8) Zumpuses are numpuses.\n(9) Rex is a shumpus.\n(10) Rex is a jompus.\nProof Obligation: Prove: (11) Rex is a wumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. From (10), Rex is a jompus.\n2. From (5), jompuses are grimpuses. Therefore, Rex is a grimpus.\n3. From (2), everything that is a wumpus, a shumpus, or a sterpus is an impus. Since Rex is a shumpus, Rex is an impus.\n4. From (3), rompuses are impuses. So, if Rex were a rompus, Rex would be an impus, but we already know that Rex is an impus.\n5. From (1), since Rex is a grimpus, Rex is a wumpus and a rompus and a zumpus.\n6. Therefore, Rex is a wumpus. \n\nSo, the answer is (10)->(11).\n\n### Problem 2:\nPremises: \n(1) Everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is a wumpus and a rompus and a zumpus.\n(2) Everything that is a wumpus, a shumpus, or a sterpus is an impus.\n(3) Rompuses are impuses.\n(4) Everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is an impus.\n(5) Each jompus is a grimpus.\n(6) Jompuses are impuses.\n(7) Everything that is a grimpus, a sterpus, or a lempus is a numpus.\n(8) Zumpuses are numpuses.\n(9) Rex is a shumpus.\n(10) Rex is a jompus.\nProof Obligation: Prove: (11) Rex is a numpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. From (10), Rex is a jompus.\n2. From (5), jompuses are grimpuses. Therefore, Rex is a grimpus.\n3. From (2), everything that is a wumpus, a shumpus, or a sterpus is an impus. Since Rex is a shumpus, Rex is an impus.\n4. From (7), everything that is a grimpus, a sterpus, or a lempus is a numpus. Since Rex is a grimpus, Rex is a numpus.\n5. Therefore, Rex is a numpus.\n\nSo, the answer is (10)->(11).\n\n### Problem 3:\nPremises: \n(1) Everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is a wumpus and a rompus and a zumpus.\n(2) Everything that is a wumpus, a shumpus, or a sterpus is an impus.\n(3) Rompuses are impuses.\n(4) Everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is an impus.\n(5) Each jompus is a grimpus.\n(6) Jompuses are impuses.\n(7) Everything that is a grimpus, a sterpus, or a lempus is a numpus.\n(8) Zumpuses are numpuses.\n(9) Rex is a shumpus.\n(10) Rex is a jompus.\nProof Obligation: Prove: (11) Rex is a tumpus or a dumpus or a wumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. From (10), Rex is a jompus.\n2. From (5), jompuses are grimpuses. Therefore, Rex is a grimpus.\n3. From (2), everything that is a wumpus, a shumpus, or a sterpus is an impus. Since Rex is a shumpus, Rex is an impus.\n4. From (1), since Rex is a grimpus, Rex is a wumpus and a rompus and a zumpus.\n5. Therefore, Rex is a wumpus.\n6.
