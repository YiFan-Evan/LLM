From (3), since Sally is opaque and a brimpus, Sally is a dumpus. Next, since Sally is melodic and a sterpus (from (10) and (15)), she is a lempus (from (5)). But this does not help directly. However, from (6), since Sally is kind and a sterpus, Sally is a brimpus, which we already know. The key here is that Sally is rainy (from (12)) and a dumpus (from our previous deduction using (3)).
