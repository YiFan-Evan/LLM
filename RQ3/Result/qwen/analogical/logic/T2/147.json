From premise (10), we know Max is metallic. However, we need to establish that Max is also a shumpus. To do this, we need to use premise (6) and (13) to show Max is a wumpus and then premise (1) and (9) to show Max is a shumpus. \n\nHowever, since the direct path involves using (10) and (7), we need to ensure Max is a shumpus first.
