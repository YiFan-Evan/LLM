Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, or a rompus is a zumpus.\n\n### Proof Obligation:\nWe need to prove that Sally is a lempus, a tumpus, or a grimpus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n- From premise (1), we know Sally is a vumpus, a lorpus, and a dumpus.\n- From premise (2), we know Sally is a wumpus, a yumpus, and a sterpus.\n- From premise (4), lorpuses are sterpuses, so Sally is a sterpus.\n- From premise (7), vumpuses are sterpuses, so Sally is a sterpus.\n- From premise (8), vumpuses are impuses, so Sally is an impus.\n- From premise (6), every impus is a shumpus, a tumpus, and a jompus. Since Sally is an impus, she is a shumpus, a tumpus, and a jompus.\n- From premise (9), every jompus is a wumpus. Since Sally is a jompus, she is a wumpus.\n- From premise (10), each impus is a wumpus. Since Sally is an impus, she is a wumpus.\n- From premise (11), everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, or a rompus is a zumpus. Since Sally is a yumpus and a tumpus, she is a zumpus.\n\nHowever, none of the premises mention \"lempus\" or \"grimpus\". Therefore, it is impossible to derive that Sally is a lempus or a grimpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only way Sally could satisfy the proof obligation (12) is if she is a tumpus. Since we have already established that Sally is a tumpus, the proof obligation can be satisfied.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises that allows us to prove (12) is those that establish Sally as a tumpus.\n\n**Answer:** (1),(2),(6),(8),(11)->(12)\n\nThis is because premises (1), (2), (6), (8), and (11) together allow us to conclude that Sally is a tumpus, thus satisfying the proof obligation."}]
