Here's the breakdown:\n\n### Problem Analysis:\nWe need to prove that Max is either a rompus, a grimpus, or a numpus. Let's examine the premises and see if we can derive any of these properties for Max.\n\n1. **Premise (1):** Max is a tumpus.\n2. **Premise (2):** Max is a lempus.\n3. **Premise (3):** Each tumpus is a brimpus.\n4. **Premise (4):** Jompuses are lorpuses.\n5. **Premise (5):** Each tumpus is a jompus, a grimpus, and a dumpus.\n6. **Premise (6):** Every dumpus is a wumpus.\n7. **Premise (7):** Everything that is a grimpus, a gorpus, or a yumpus is a vumpus.\n\nFrom Premise (1), we know that Max is a tumpus. Using Premise (5), we can deduce the following about Max:\n- Max is a jompus (since Max is a tumpus).\n- Max is a grimpus (since Max is a tumpus).\n- Max is a dumpus (since Max is a tumpus).\n\nSince Max is a grimpus, from Premise (7), we know that everything that is a grimpus is a vumpus. Therefore, Max is a vumpus. However, the proof obligation requires us to show that Max is a rompus, a grimpus, or a numpus. We already have that Max is a grimpus, so the proof obligation is satisfied.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is a rompus, a grimpus, or a numpus is simply (1) and (5), because from these, we can directly conclude that Max is a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(5)->(8)."}]
