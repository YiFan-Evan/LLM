From premise (1), Alex is a lempus and Alex is not a numpus and Alex is a gorpus.\n2. From premise (4), Alex is a tumpus.\n3. From premise (7), every tumpus is a numpus. Hence, since Alex is a tumpus, Alex must be a numpus.\n4. However, from premise (1), Alex is not a numpus. This creates a direct contradiction.\n5. Given this contradiction, Alex cannot satisfy the condition of being a tumpus while also not being a numpus.\n6. Additionally, from premise (6), brimpuses are jompuses, numpuses, and zumpuses. Since Alex is not a numpus (premise 1), Alex cannot be a brimpus.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that Alex cannot be a brimpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Alex is not a brimpus are premises (1) and (4).\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n(1),(4)->(11)"}]
