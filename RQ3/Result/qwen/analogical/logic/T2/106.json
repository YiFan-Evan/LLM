We also need premises (11) and (12) to show that Sam is a zumpus, and since every zumpus is a jompus (premise 9), Sam is a jompus. Premise (10) states that every impus is a grimpus, a gorpus, and a jompus. Since Sam is a jompus, if Sam were an impus, Sam would also be a grimpus and a gorpus. However, premise (8) states that grimpuses are dumpuses, so if Sam were an impus, Sam would also be a dumpus.
