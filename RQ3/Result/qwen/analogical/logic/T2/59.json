To do this, we need to use the relevant premises to establish that Alex is a grimpus and that Alex is both orange and red.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Establish that Alex is a grimpus:**\n   - From premises (2) and (3), we know Alex is angry and aggressive.\n   - From premise (1), we know Alex is a shumpus.\n   - From premise (15), if something is angry, aggressive, and a shumpus, then it is a grimpus. Since Alex meets these conditions, Alex is a grimpus.\n\n2. **Establish that Alex is orange and red:**\n   - From premises (7) and (8), we know Alex is red and orange.\n\n3. **Combine the results:**\n   - Now that we have established Alex is a grimpus and Alex is orange and red, we can use premise (11) which states that everything that is orange and red and a grimpus is a vumpus. While we don't need to conclude that Alex is a vumpus, we have already proven that Alex is orange and red and a grimpus.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises Needed:\n\n- **Premise (1):** Establishes that Alex is a shumpus.\n- **Premise (2):** Establishes that Alex is angry.\n- **Premise (3):** Establishes that Alex is aggressive.\n- **Premise (15):** Connects being angry, aggressive, and a shumpus to being a grimpus.\n- **Premise (7):** Establishes that Alex is red.\n- **Premise (8):** Establishes that Alex is orange.\n\nCombining these premises, we can conclude that Alex is orange and red and a grimpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(2),(3),(7),(8),(15)->(16)**"}]
