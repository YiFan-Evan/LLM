From premise (10): Max is a wumpus.\n2. From premise (9): Everything that is transparent, opaque, or a wumpus is a grimpus. Since Max is a wumpus, Max is a grimpus.\n3. We need to show that Max is blue, orange, or a lempus.\n4. From premise (8): Everything that is windy, rainy, or a gorpus is a dumpus. Since Max is a gorpus, Max is a dumpus.\n5. We need to show that Max is blue, orange, or a lempus.\n6. From premise (3): Everything that is aggressive or angry or a gorpus is a lempus. Since Max is a gorpus, Max is a lempus.\n7.
