However, we don't have a direct connection between Rex being a lempus and rompus.\n  - From (11), every lempus is a zumpus.\n  - From (3), zumpuses are jompuses.\n  - From (8), jompuses are windy, but this does not directly help us prove Rex is not sour.\n  - From (2), every impus is not loud, but this also doesn't help us prove Rex is not sour.\n  - From (12), numpuses are not temperate, but again, this doesn't help us prove Rex is not sour.\n  - From (13), each wumpus is feisty, but this doesn't help us either.\n  - From (14), each lempus is kind, but this doesn't help us prove Rex is not sour.\n  - From (10), vumpuses are not liquid, but Rex isn't a vumpus.\n  - From (9), each lempus is a vumpus, but Rex isn't a vumpus either.\n  - We need to find a connection between Rex and being a rompus, which would prove Rex is not sour.\n- **Conclusion:** The minimal set of premises needed to prove Rex is not sour is (19), (20), (7), (17), (15).
