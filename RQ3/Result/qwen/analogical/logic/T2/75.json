This means we need to use the premises that establish both conditions.\n\n1. **Wren is sunny**: Given directly as premise (2).\n2. **Wren is a tumpus**: We need to derive this from other premises.\n\nFrom premise (13), we know:\n- If something is wooden and a numpus, it is a tumpus.\n\nGiven that Wren is wooden (premise (1)) and Wren is a numpus (premise (3)), we can use premise (13) to conclude that Wren is a tumpus.\n\nNow, since Wren is sunny (premise (2)) and Wren is a tumpus (conclusion from premises (1) and (3) using premise (13)), we can use premise (16) to conclude that Wren is an impus.\n\nHowever, the specific proof obligation is to show that Wren is sunny and a tumpus. We already have:\n- Wren is sunny (from premise (2)).\n- Wren is a tumpus (from premises (1) and (3) using premise (13)).\n\nThus, combining these two results, we can conclude that Wren is sunny and a tumpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Wren is sunny and a tumpus is:\n- Premise (1): Wren is wooden.\n- Premise (2): Wren is sunny.\n- Premise (3): Wren is a numpus.\n- Premise (13): Everything that is wooden and a numpus is a tumpus.\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n(1),(2),(3),(13)->(17)."}]
