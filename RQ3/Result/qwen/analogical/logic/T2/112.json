Let's break it down into three related but distinct problems.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:**\n1. Everything that is fruity or a numpus is a zumpus.\n2. Everything that is temperate or a tumpus is a grimpus.\n3. Everything that is rainy or a gorpus is a jompus.\n4. Everything that is liquid or a brimpus is a vumpus.\n5. Everything that is brown or a numpus is a tumpus.\n6. Everything that is discordant or a grimpus is a yumpus.\n7. Everything that is transparent or a brimpus is a numpus.\n8.

Rex is temperate or a tumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From Premise 10, Rex is a numpus.\n- From Premise 5, since Rex is a numpus, Rex is also a tumpus (because everything that is brown or a numpus is a tumpus, and we don't have any information about Rex being brown).\n- Therefore, Rex is a tumpus, and thus Rex is temperate or a tumpus (since he is a tumpus).\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove this is Premises 5 and 10.\n\n**Answer: (5),(10)->(12)**\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**\n1.

Rex is temperate or a tumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From Premise 11, Rex is a gorpus.\n- From Premise 3, since Rex is a gorpus, Rex is a jompus (but this does not help us directly).\n- From Premise 7, since Rex is a numpus (Premise 10), Rex could be a brimpus if he were transparent, but we don't know that.\n- From Premise 5, since Rex is a numpus (Premise 10), Rex is also a tumpus.\n- Therefore, Rex is a tumpus, and thus Rex is temperate or a tumpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove this is Premises 5 and 10.\n\n**Answer: (5),(10)->(12)**\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**\n1.
