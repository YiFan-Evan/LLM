Let's go through the premises step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Premise (1):** Sally is a wumpus.\n2. **Premise (2):** Sally is a brimpus.\n3. **Premise (3):** Everything that is opaque or a brimpus is a zumpus.\n4. **Premise (4):** Everything that is feisty or a gorpus is a numpus.\n5. **Premise (5):** Everything that is slow or a gorpus is a lorpus.\n6. **Premise (6):** Everything that is brown or a vumpus is a shumpus.\n7. **Premise (7):** Everything that is rainy or a brimpus is a vumpus.\n8. **Premise (8):** Everything that is temperate or a vumpus is a tumpus.\n9. **Premise (9):** Everything that is dull or a lorpus is a brimpus.\n10. **Premise (10):** Everything that is large or a wumpus is a dumpus.\n11. **Premise (11):** Everything that is discordant or a lorpus is a lempus.\n\nWe need to show that Sally is either brown or a vumpus.\n\n### Derivation Process:\n\n- From **Premise (2)**: Sally is a brimpus.\n- From **Premise (7)**: Since Sally is a brimpus, and brimpus implies Sally could be a vumpus if she is rainy. But there is no information about Sally being rainy, so this doesn't directly help.\n- From **Premise (9)**: If Sally were a lorpus, she would be dull. But there is no information about Sally being a lorpus, so this doesn't help directly either.\n- From **Premise (3)**: Since Sally is a brimpus, and brimpus implies she could be a zumpus if she is opaque. Again, no information about Sally being opaque, so this doesn't help directly.\n\nThe key premises here are:\n- **Premise (2):** Sally is a brimpus.\n- **Premise (7):** Everything that is rainy or a brimpus is a vumpus.\n\nSince Sally is a brimpus, if she is rainy, she would be a vumpus. However, there is no information about Sally being rainy. We need to find another way to conclude that Sally is a vumpus or brown.\n\nGiven that Sally is a brimpus, and from **Premise (7)**, we need to check if there is any other premise that directly links brimpus to vumpus or brown. There isn't any direct link without additional context. However, since Sally is already a brimpus, we can use **Premise (7)** to conclude that she could be a vumpus if she is rainy. But since we do not have information about her being rainy, we cannot conclusively say she is a vumpus just from these premises.\n\nHowever, **Premise (7)** provides a potential path if we assume Sally is rainy. Without additional context, we need to rely on the fact that Sally is a brimpus and potentially rainy to conclude she is a vumpus.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises Needed:\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Sally is brown or a vumpus is:\n- Sally is a brimpus (Premise 2)\n- Rainy or a brimpus implies vumpus (Premise 7)\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed is **(2) and (7)**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(7)->(12)"}]
