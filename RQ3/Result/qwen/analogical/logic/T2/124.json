Stella is an impus.\n2. Stella is bright.\n3. Stella is dull.\n4. Stella is slow.\n5. Stella is moderate.\n6. Stella is floral.\n7. Stella is a brimpus.\n8. Stella is fruity.\n9.

Everything that is opaque, transparent, and a gorpus is a jompus.\n14. Everything that is slow, moderate, and a brimpus is a sterpus.\n15. Everything that is small and large and an impus is a grimpus.\n\n#### Proof Obligation:\n16. Stella is dull and bright and a tumpus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises:**\n   - Premise (12) states: \"Everything that is fruity, floral, and a brimpus is a tumpus.\"\n   - We need to check if Stella satisfies the conditions in Premise (12).\n\n2. **Check Conditions for Premise (12):**\n   - From Premises (6) and (8), we know that Stella is floral and fruity.\n   - From Premise (7), we know that Stella is a brimpus.\n\n3. **Apply Premise (12):**\n   - Since Stella is fruity, floral, and a brimpus, by Premise (12), Stella is a tumpus.\n\n4. **Check Additional Conditions for Premise (16):**\n   - We need to confirm that Stella is dull and bright.\n   - From Premises (2) and (3), we know that Stella is both bright and dull.\n\n5. **Combine Conditions:**\n   - From Premises (2) and (3), we know Stella is dull and bright.\n   - From the previous step, we know Stella is a tumpus.\n   - Therefore, Stella is dull and bright and a tumpus.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that \"Stella is dull and bright and a tumpus\" is:\n- Premise (6) (Stella is floral)\n- Premise (8) (Stella is fruity)\n- Premise (7) (Stella is a brimpus)\n- Premise (12) (Everything that is fruity, floral, and a brimpus is a tumpus)\n- Premise (2) (Stella is bright)\n- Premise (3) (Stella is dull)\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises leading to the proof obligation is:\n\\((6), (8), (7), (12), (2), (3) \\rightarrow (16)\\)\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: \\((6), (8), (7), (12), (2), (3) \\rightarrow (16)\\)"}]
