Let's break down the problem into three related but not identical scenarios.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a jompus.  \n(2) Everything that is a yumpus or an impus is a numpus.  \n(3) Everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a numpus.  \n(4) Alex is not a numpus.  \n(5) Alex is not a rompus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(6) Alex is not a grimpus and Alex is not a lorpus.\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom premise (3), if Alex were a lorpus or a grimpus, Alex would be a numpus. However, premise (4) states that Alex is not a numpus. Therefore, Alex cannot be a lorpus or a grimpus. This means Alex is neither a lorpus nor a grimpus. Thus, the proof obligation (6) holds true.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a jompus.  \n(2) Everything that is a yumpus or an impus is a numpus.  \n(3) Everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a numpus.  \n(4) Alex is not a numpus.  \n(5) Alex is not a rompus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(6) Alex is not a lorpus.\n\n**Solution:**\nSimilar to Problem 1, premise (3) implies that if Alex were a lorpus or a grimpus, Alex would be a numpus. Since Alex is not a numpus (from premise (4)), Alex cannot be a lorpus or a grimpus. Therefore, Alex is not a lorpus. \n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a jompus.  \n(2) Everything that is a yumpus or an impus is a numpus.  \n(3) Everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a numpus.  \n(4) Alex is not a numpus.  \n(5) Alex is not a rompus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(6) Alex is not a grimpus.\n\n**Solution:**\nAgain, premise (3) implies that if Alex were a lorpus or a grimpus, Alex would be a numpus. Since Alex is not a numpus (from premise (4)), Alex cannot be a lorpus or a grimpus. Therefore, Alex is not a grimpus.\n\n### Final Answer:\nCombining the insights from the three problems above, we see that the critical premises needed to prove that Alex is not a grimpus and Alex is not a lorpus are premises (3) and (4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(3),(4)->(6)**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is not a rompus.

(5) Everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a jompus.] Prove: (6) Alex is not a grimpus and Alex is not a lorpus."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, let's analyze the logical relationships step-by-step based on the given premises and the proof obligation.\n\n### Premises Breakdown:\n1. Alex is not a rompus.\n2. Alex is not a numpus.\n3. Everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a numpus.\n4. Everything that is a yumpus or an impus is a numpus.\n5. Everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a jompus.\n\n### Proof Obligation:\n(6) Alex is not a grimpus and Alex is not a lorpus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n- From premise (3), if Alex were a lorpus or a grimpus, then Alex would be a numpus.\n- From premise (2), Alex is not a numpus.\n- Therefore, Alex cannot be a lorpus or a grimpus because if Alex were either, Alex would be a numpus, which contradicts premise (2).\n\n### Solution:\nThe key premises needed to derive the proof obligation are premises (2) and (3). Premise (2) directly states that Alex is not a numpus, and premise (3) implies that being a lorpus or a grimpus would make Alex a numpus, which is impossible given premise (2).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(2),(3)->(6)**."}]
