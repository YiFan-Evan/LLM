Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n### Problem Analysis:\nWe need to show that Max is a shumpus using the given premises. We know that:\n- Max is a lempus, a numpus, a dumpus, or a zumpus (Premise 1).\n- Max is also a numpus, a dumpus, a zumpus, or a rompus (Premise 2).\n\nFrom Premise 2, we can infer that Max must be one of the following: numpus, dumpus, zumpus, or rompus. We need to check if each of these cases leads to the conclusion that Max is a shumpus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. **Numpus Case**:\n   - Premise 9: Numpuses are sterpuses.\n   - Premise 10: Each numpus is a shumpus.\n   - Therefore, if Max is a numpus, Max is a shumpus.\n\n2. **Dumpus Case**:\n   - Premise 12: Dumpuses are sterpuses.\n   - Premise 11: Each dumpus is a shumpus.\n   - Therefore, if Max is a dumpus, Max is a shumpus.\n\n3. **Zumpus Case**:\n   - Premise 5: Zumpuses are sterpuses.\n   - Premise 6: Each zumpus is a shumpus.\n   - Therefore, if Max is a zumpus, Max is a shumpus.\n\n4. **Rompus Case**:\n   - Premise 15: Every rompus is a shumpus.\n   - Therefore, if Max is a rompus, Max is a shumpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the above cases, we need to ensure that the premises cover all possible scenarios for Max being a shumpus. We can use the following minimal set of premises to cover all cases:\n- Premise 9: Numpuses are sterpuses.\n- Premise 10: Each numpus is a shumpus.\n- Premise 12: Dumpuses are sterpuses.\n- Premise 11: Each dumpus is a shumpus.\n- Premise 5: Zumpuses are sterpuses.\n- Premise 6: Each zumpus is a shumpus.\n- Premise 15: Every rompus is a shumpus.\n\nHowever, since Premise 2 already covers all the possibilities (numpus, dumpus, zumpus, or rompus), we can simplify this to the minimal set covering the specific cases where Max could be a shumpus directly.\n\n### Minimal Set:\nThe minimal set of premises that allows us to conclude that Max is a shumpus is:\n- Premise 10: Each numpus is a shumpus.\n- Premise 11: Each dumpus is a shumpus.\n- Premise 6: Each zumpus is a shumpus.\n- Premise 15: Every rompus is a shumpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed is (10), (11), (6), and (15).\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(10),(11),(6),(15)->(16)**."}]
