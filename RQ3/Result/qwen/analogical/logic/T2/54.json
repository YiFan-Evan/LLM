Since Max is also a brimpus (premise 12), and everything that is a brimpus is a zumpus (premise 2), we have no direct way to conclude Max is a vumpus from these premises alone.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is spicy, sour, or a numpus is a tumpus.  \n(2) Everything that is orange, red, or a brimpus is a zumpus.  \n(3) Everything that is opaque, transparent, or a yumpus is a grimpus.  \n(4) Everything that is wooden or luminous or a sterpus is a yumpus.  \n(5) Everything that is hot, cold, or a sterpus is a shumpus.  \n(6) Everything that is earthy or fruity or a vumpus is a numpus.  \n(7) Everything that is small or large or a vumpus is a lempus.  \n(8) Everything that is muffled, melodic, or a wumpus is a sterpus.  \n(9) Everything that is dull or bright or a wumpus is a dumpus.  \n(10) Everything that is nervous, shy, or a yumpus is a vumpus.  \n(11) Everything that is slow, fast, or a numpus is a lorpus.  \n(12) Max is a brimpus.  \n(13) Max is a yumpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(14) Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus.  \n\n**Solution:**  \nMax is a yumpus (premise 13). According to premise 10, if Max is a yumpus, then Max is either nervous, shy, or a vumpus. Since nervous or shy does not directly lead to earthy or fruity, we need to look at the definition of vumpus. From premise 6, if Max is a vumpus, then Max is either earthy or fruity or a vumpus.
