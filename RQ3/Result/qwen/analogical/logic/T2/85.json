From premise (1), since Fae is a gorpus, it follows that Fae is a jompus (because everything that is a gorpus is a jompus according to premise (1)). Therefore, Fae is a jompus, which means Fae is blue or a jompus (since being a jompus satisfies the condition).\n\nSo the minimal set of premises needed is (8),(1)->(10).\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is earthy or a gorpus is a jompus.  \n(2) Everything that is blue or a jompus is a wumpus.  \n(3) Everything that is nervous or a gorpus is a sterpus.  \n(4) Everything that is large or a tumpus is a gorpus.  \n(5) Everything that is moderate or a shumpus is a grimpus.  \n(6) Everything that is temperate or a tumpus is a brimpus.  \n(7) Everything that is opaque or a jompus is a rompus.  \n(9) Fae is a shumpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \nProve: (10) Fae is blue or a jompus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nSince we do not have premise (8) in this scenario, we cannot directly conclude that Fae is a jompus. However, premise (9) tells us that Fae is a shumpus. We need to find a way to connect this to the conclusion. Unfortunately, none of the other premises directly link Fae being a shumpus to being blue or a jompus. So, we cannot prove the conclusion without premise (8).\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is earthy or a gorpus is a jompus.  \n(2) Everything that is blue or a jompus is a wumpus.  \n(3) Everything that is nervous or a gorpus is a sterpus.  \n(4) Everything that is large or a tumpus is a gorpus.  \n(5) Everything that is moderate or a shumpus is a grimpus.  \n(6) Everything that is temperate or a tumpus is a brimpus.  \n(7) Everything that is opaque or a jompus is a rompus.  \n(8) Fae is a gorpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \nProve: (10) Fae is blue or a jompus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom premise (8), we know that Fae is a gorpus.
