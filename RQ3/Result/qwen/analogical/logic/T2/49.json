We'll break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is melodic and muffled and discordant and a dumpus is a lempus.  \n(6) Rex is brown.  \n(8) Rex is discordant.  \n(10) Rex is muffled.  \n(11) Rex is a dumpus.  \n(13) Rex is melodic.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \nProve: (16) Rex is red and orange and brown and a lempus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom (13), (10), (8), and (11), we can conclude that Rex is melodic, muffled, discordant, and a dumpus. Using premise (1), we can infer that Rex is a lempus. However, we do not have any information about Rex being red or orange. Therefore, we cannot prove (16) with these premises alone.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**  \n(2) Everything that is red, orange, brown, and a lempus is a shumpus.  \n(6) Rex is brown.  \n(12) Rex is orange.  \n(14) Rex is red.  \n(16) Rex is red and orange and brown and a lempus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \nProve: (16) Rex is red and orange and brown and a lempus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom (12) and (14), we know Rex is both red and orange. From (6), we know Rex is brown. We need to prove Rex is a lempus. Premise (2) tells us that if something is red, orange, brown, and a lempus, it is a shumpus. To use this premise, we need to prove Rex is a lempus. Since we do not have any other premises directly stating Rex is a lempus, we cannot prove (16) with these premises alone.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is melodic and muffled and discordant and a dumpus is a lempus.  \n(6) Rex is brown.  \n(8) Rex is discordant.  \n(10) Rex is muffled.  \n(11) Rex is a dumpus.  \n(13) Rex is melodic.  \n(14) Rex is red.  \n(12) Rex is orange.  \n(15) Rex is opaque.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \nProve: (16) Rex is red and orange and brown and a lempus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom (13), (10), (8), and (11), we can conclude that Rex is melodic, muffled, discordant, and a dumpus. Using premise (1), we can infer that Rex is a lempus. From (6), (12), and (14), we know Rex is brown, orange, and red.
