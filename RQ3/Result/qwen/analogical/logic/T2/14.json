Let's analyze the given premises step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Premises Involving Stella's Identity:**\n   - (1) Stella is a tumpus, a brimpus, or a jompus.\n   - (2) Stella is a brimpus or a jompus or a numpus.\n\n2. **Combining Premises (1) and (2):**\n   - From (1) and (2), we can conclude that Stella must be one of the following: a tumpus, a brimpus, a jompus, or a numpus. However, since tumpuses, brimpuses, jompuses, and numpuses are all rompuses (from (3), (4), (5), and (7)), we need to check if being a rompus guarantees being a wumpus.\n\n3. **Rompuses and Wumpuses:**\n   - (3) Every numpus is a rompus.\n   - (4) Jompuses are rompuses.\n   - (5) Tumpuses are rompuses.\n   - (7) Each brimpus is a rompus.\n   - (11) Every jompus is a wumpus.\n   - (12) Each brimpus is a wumpus.\n\n4. **Combining Rompus and Wumpus Premises:**\n   - From (11), every jompus is a wumpus.\n   - From (12), each brimpus is a wumpus.\n   - From (6), every numpus is a wumpus.\n\n5. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - Since Stella must be one of the following: a tumpus, a brimpus, a jompus, or a numpus, and all these categories are either directly stated to be wumpuses or lead to being a wumpus through the properties of rompuses, we can conclude that Stella is a wumpus.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Stella is a wumpus includes:\n- (1) Stella is a tumpus, a brimpus, or a jompus.\n- (2) Stella is a brimpus or a jompus or a numpus.\n- (6) Numpuses are wumpuses.\n- (11) Every jompus is a wumpus.\n- (12) Each brimpus is a wumpus.\n\nHowever, since (1) and (2) together imply that Stella is a brimpus, jompus, or numpus, and we know from (6), (11), and (12) that these are all wumpuses, we can simplify to just the relevant wumpus premises.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(6),(11),(12)->(13)"}]
