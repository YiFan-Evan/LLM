Let's break it down into three related but not identical problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:** \n(1) Every impus is a wumpus.\n(2) Yumpuses are impuses.\n(3) Yumpuses are not fast.\n(4) Every jompus is metallic.\n(5) Each rompus is dull.\n(6) Sterpuses are not shy.\n(7) Each impus is not sunny.\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \n(8) Fae is not sunny.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe need to show that Fae is an impus to conclude that Fae is not sunny using premise (7). However, there are no premises linking Fae to an impus directly in this set. Therefore, we cannot prove (8) based on these premises alone.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:** \n(1) Every impus is a wumpus.\n(2) Yumpuses are impuses.\n(3) Yumpuses are not fast.\n(4) Every jompus is metallic.\n(5) Each rompus is dull.\n(6) Sterpuses are not shy.\n(7) Each impus is not sunny.\n(8) Vumpuses are yumpuses.\n(9) Grimpuses are numpuses.\n(10) Lorpuses are temperate.\n(11) Each shumpus is large.\n(12) Grimpuses are not amenable.\n(13) Jompuses are shumpuses.\n(14) Numpuses are not opaque.\n(15) Every yumpus is a sterpus.\n(16) Each lorpus is a lempus.\n(17) Brimpuses are not brown.\n(18) Every vumpus is a brimpus.\n(19) Grimpuses are jompuses.\n(20) Impuses are rompuses.\n(21) Each vumpus is earthy.\n(22) Each jompus is a vumpus.\n(23) Fae is a lorpus.\n(24) Fae is a jompus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \n(25) Fae is not sunny.\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom (24), we know Fae is a jompus. From (22), every jompus is a vumpus. From (8), vumpuses are yumpuses. From (2), yumpuses are impuses. Hence, Fae is an impus. From (7), every impus is not sunny.
