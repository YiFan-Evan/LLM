From premise (15), every brimpus is a tumpus. Since Max is a brimpus, Max is a tumpus.\n6. Now that we know Max is a tumpus, we can use premise (1) again: every tumpus is a lorpus. Therefore, Max is a lorpus.\n7. From premise (17), every lorpus is a numpus. Therefore, since Max is a lorpus, Max is a numpus.\n8. From premise (20), every numpus is a vumpus.
