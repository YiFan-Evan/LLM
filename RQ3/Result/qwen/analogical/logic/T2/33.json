Every jompus is a gorpus.\n\n### Proof Obligation:\n16. Wren is a gorpus.\n\n### Analysis:\nWe need to determine which premises are essential to conclude that Wren is a gorpus. Let's break down the possible scenarios for Wren based on the premises:\n\n1. **Wren as a yumpus**: \n   - From premise (5), yumpuses are wumpuses.\n   - From premise (9), each yumpus is a gorpus.\n   - Therefore, if Wren is a yumpus, Wren is a gorpus.\n\n2. **Wren as a zumpus**: \n   - From premise (3), zumpuses are wumpuses.\n   - From premise (8), zumpuses are gorpuses.\n   - Therefore, if Wren is a zumpus, Wren is a gorpus.\n\n3. **Wren as a sterpus**: \n   - From premise (6), each sterpus is a wumpus.\n   - From premise (12), sterpuses are gorpuses.\n   - Therefore, if Wren is a sterpus, Wren is a gorpus.\n\n4. **Wren as a lempus**: \n   - From premise (11), each lempus is a wumpus.\n   - From premise (13), each lempus is a gorpus.\n   - Therefore, if Wren is a lempus, Wren is a gorpus.\n\n5. **Wren as a tumpus**: \n   - From premise (10), tumpuses are wumpuses.\n   - From premise (6), each sterpus is a wumpus.\n   - However, we do not have a direct premise stating tumpuses are gorpuses or wumpuses are gorpuses. Thus, we need additional information to conclude that tumpuses are gorpuses.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the minimal set of premises that allow us to conclude that Wren is a gorpus are those that directly link Wren to being a yumpus, zumpus, sterpus, or lempus, and those that establish the gorpus property for these types of objects.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove (16) is:\n- Premise (1): Establishes the possible types of Wren.\n- Premise (9): Establishes that yumpuses are gorpuses.\n- Premise (8): Establishes that zumpuses are gorpuses.\n- Premise (12): Establishes that sterpuses are gorpuses.\n- Premise (13): Establishes that lempuses are gorpuses.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed is:\n\n\\[\n(1),(8),(9),(12),(13)->(16)\n\\]\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n(1),(8),(9),(12),(13)->(16)\n\\]"}]
