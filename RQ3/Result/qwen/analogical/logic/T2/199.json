Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. Polly is a wumpus (Premise 1).\n2. Polly is a rompus (Premise 2).\n3. Wumpuses are shumpuses (Premise 3).\n4. Everything that is a vumpus, a grimpus, or a brimpus is a dumpus (Premise 4).\n5. Every sterpus is a gorpus (Premise 5).\n6. Vumpuses are rompuses (Premise 6).\n7. Everything that is a lempus or a jompus or a lorpus is a dumpus (Premise 7).\n8. Everything that is a vumpus, a grimpus, or a brimpus is a lempus (Premise 8).\n9.

From Premise 1 and Premise 3, since Polly is a wumpus and wumpuses are shumpuses, Polly is a shumpus.\n2. From Premise 9, since Polly is a wumpus, Polly is also a vumpus, a sterpus, and a brimpus.\n3. From Premise 8, since Polly is a vumpus, a brimpus, and we know Polly is a vumpus and a brimpus, Polly is a lempus.\n4. Therefore, Polly is a lempus, which means Polly is a lempus or an impus or a yumpus (since lempus is included in the disjunction).\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\n- Premise 1: Polly is a wumpus.\n- Premise 2: Polly is a rompus.\n- Premise 9: Every wumpus is a vumpus and a sterpus and a brimpus.\n- Premise 8: Everything that is a vumpus, a grimpus, or a brimpus is a lempus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Polly is a lempus or an impus or a yumpus is Premise 1, Premise 9, and Premise 8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(9),(8)->(11)**"}]
