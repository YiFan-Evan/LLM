Wren is a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus or a brimpus.\n2. Wren is a yumpus or a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus.\n3. Numpuses are sterpuses.\n4. Every yumpus is a sterpus.\n5.

Rompuses are impuses.\n13. Each gorpus is an impus.\n14. Each brimpus is a sterpus.\n15. Shumpuses are impuses.\n\nWe need to prove:\n16. Wren is an impus.\n\n### Analysis:\nFrom premise (1):\n- Wren is either a dumpus, a tumpus, a numpus, or a brimpus.\n\nFrom premise (2):\n- Wren is either a yumpus, a dumpus, a tumpus, or a numpus.\n\nCombining (1) and (2):\n- Wren is either a dumpus, a tumpus, a numpus, a brimpus, or a yumpus.\n\nNow, we check each possibility:\n\n#### Case 1: Wren is a dumpus\n- From (7): Each dumpus is a sterpus.\n- From (8): Dumpuses are impuses.\n- Therefore, if Wren is a dumpus, Wren is an impus.\n\n#### Case 2: Wren is a tumpus\n- From (9): Tumpuses are sterpuses.\n- From (5): Tumpuses are impuses.\n- Therefore, if Wren is a tumpus, Wren is an impus.\n\n#### Case 3: Wren is a numpus\n- From (3): Numpuses are sterpuses.\n- From (10): Numpuses are impuses.\n- Therefore, if Wren is a numpus, Wren is an impus.\n\n#### Case 4: Wren is a brimpus\n- From (14): Each brimpus is a sterpus.\n- From (11): Each brimpus is an impus.\n- Therefore, if Wren is a brimpus, Wren is an impus.\n\n#### Case 5: Wren is a yumpus\n- From (4): Every yumpus is a sterpus.\n- From (2): Wren is a yumpus or a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus.\n- Since we already established that dumpuses, tumpuses, and numpuses are impuses, we need to confirm yumpuses.\n- From (4): Every yumpus is a sterpus.\n- From (2): Since Wren is a yumpus, and every yumpus is a sterpus, and we need to check sterpus cases:\n- From (10): Numpuses are impuses, but yumpus is a sterpus.\n- Therefore, if Wren is a yumpus, Wren is an impus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFrom the above analysis, we see that in all possible cases, Wren is an impus.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises Required:\nTo prove Wren is an impus, we need the following premises:\n- (5) Tumpuses are impuses.\n- (8) Dumpuses are impuses.\n- (10) Numpuses are impuses.\n- (11) Each brimpus is an impus.\n- (14) Each brimpus is a sterpus.\n- (15) Shumpuses are impuses.\n- (2) Wren is a yumpus or a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus.\n\nHowever, since (15) is not relevant here and (14) is redundant with (11), we can simplify to:\n- (5), (8), (10), (11), (2).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises is:\n**(5),(8),(10),(11),(2)->(16)**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(5),(8),(10),(11),(2)->(16)**."}]
