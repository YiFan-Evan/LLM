Let's break down the problem into three related but distinct scenarios to better understand the logic involved.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:**\n[(1) Sterpuses are sweet and spicy and lorpuses and gorpuses. \n(2) Every numpus is aggressive and mean and an impus and a shumpus. \n(3) Yumpuses are blue, red, jompuses, and lempuses. \n(4) Dumpuses are overcast and rainy and numpuses and yumpuses.

small and large and a sterpus and a rompus. \n(9) Polly is bright, dull, a numpus, and a dumpus. \n(10) Polly is sweet, spicy, a gorpus, and a lorpus.]\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \n(11) Polly is a yumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (9), Polly is a numpus and a dumpus.\n- From premise (4), since every yumpus is a dumpus, and Polly is a dumpus, it doesn't directly imply Polly is a yumpus yet.\n- From premise (3), yumpuses are jompuses and lempuses.\n- From premise (8), each lempus is a sterpus and a rompus.\n- From premise (10), Polly is a gorpus and a lorpus, which means she could be a sterpus or a rompus.\n- From premise (1), sterpuses are lorpuses and gorpuses, but Polly being a gorpus and lorpus does not necessarily make her a sterpus or rompus directly.\n- However, since Polly is a numpus (from premise 9), and from premise (4) numpuses are also dumpuses, and from premise (5) every wumpus is a bright and dull dumpus, and Polly matches these criteria, but there is no direct link to yumpus yet.\n- From premise (4), since every yumpus is a dumpus, and Polly is a dumpus, but we need more information about the specific properties of yumpuses.\n- From premise (3), yumpuses are blue and red, and also jompuses and lempuses.\n- From premise (7), jompuses are vumpuses and brimpuses.\n- From premise (8), lempuses are sterpuses and rompuses.\n- But Polly being sweet and spicy (from premise 10) and being a gorpus and lorpus (which are similar to sterpus and rompus) doesn't directly make her a yumpus.\n- Since Polly is a numpus and a dumpus, and yumpuses are dumpuses, we need additional properties like being blue and red to confirm Polly is a yumpus.\n- From premise (9), Polly is bright and dull, and from premise (5), every wumpus is bright and dull and a dumpus, but wumpuses aren't yumpuses directly.\n- From premise (4), since every yumpus is a dumpus and Polly is a dumpus, and from premise (3) yumpuses are blue and red, but Polly's color isn't mentioned directly.\n\nThus, Polly being a yumpus requires more specific properties like being blue and red, which are not provided.\n\n**Answer:** (9),(10)->(11)\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**\n[(1)
