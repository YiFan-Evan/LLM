We need to show that Wren is both kind and a gorpus. Here\u2019s the step-by-step logical reasoning:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis:**\n   - (1) Wren is a jompus.\n   - (2) Wren is opaque.\n   - (3) Wren is a vumpus.\n   - (4) Wren is small.\n   - (5) Wren is kind.\n   - (6) Everything that is small and a jompus is a gorpus.\n   - (7) Everything that is kind and a gorpus is a sterpus.\n   - (8) Everything that is opaque and a jompus is a wumpus.\n   - (9) Everything that is brown and a vumpus is a grimpus.\n   - (10) Everything that is sweet and a gorpus is a zumpus.\n\n2. **Deriving Intermediate Conclusions:**\n   - From (1) and (4), using (6), we can conclude that Wren is a gorpus because Wren is small and a jompus.\n   - From (5) and the fact that Wren is now established as a gorpus (from the previous step), using (7), we can conclude that Wren is a sterpus, but this is not necessary for proving Wren is kind and a gorpus.\n\n3. **Final Conclusion:**\n   - Since Wren is kind (from (5)) and a gorpus (from (6)), we can directly conclude that Wren is kind and a gorpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation (11) is (1), (4), and (5).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(4),(5)->(11)"}]
