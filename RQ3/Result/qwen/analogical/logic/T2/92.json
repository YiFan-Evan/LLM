This seems contradictory unless we can show that being a grimpus and a numpus is consistent under the given premises.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since we have derived that Max is a grimpus from (2), (7), and (17), and we have no other conflicting premises, we can conclude that Max is loud, discordant, and a grimpus.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(7),(17)->(20)"}]
