Stella is a sterpus, Stella is not a lorpus, and Stella is a jompus.\n2. Stella is a rompus, a zumpus, and a numpus.\n3. Every gorpus is an impus.\n4. Zumpuses are lorpuses.\n5.

Each tumpus is a wumpus.\n12. Stella is a zumpus.\n\n### Proof Steps:\n1. From premise (1), we know:\n   - Stella is a sterpus.\n   - Stella is not a lorpus.\n   - Stella is a jompus.\n   \n2. From premise (9), since Stella is a jompus, Stella is a zumpus (which we already knew from premise (12)).\n\n3. From premise (10), since Stella is a sterpus, Stella is a wumpus.\n\n4. From premise (4), since Stella is a zumpus, Stella is a lorpus.\n\n5. However, from premise (1), we also know that Stella is not a lorpus. This creates a contradiction if Stella were to be a gorpus.\n\n6. From premise (3), if Stella were a gorpus, then Stella would have to be an impus.\n\n7. From premise (6), if Stella were an impus, then Stella would have to be a lorpus, a tumpus, and a grimpus.\n\n8. But from premise (1), Stella is not a lorpus. This means Stella cannot be an impus, and therefore, cannot be a gorpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises that lead to the conclusion that \"Stella is not a gorpus\" is:\n\n**(1),(2),(3),(4),(10),(12)->(13)**\n\nThis set ensures that all necessary contradictions and relationships are considered to derive the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(2),(3),(4),(10),(12)->(13)**"}]
