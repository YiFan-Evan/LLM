Therefore, we need to explore if Max can still be a numpus while avoiding contradictions.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- If Max is a numpus, then from premise (12), Max must be a grimpus because Max is a numpus.\n- But from premise (5), since Max is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus, Max cannot be a grimpus.\n- Hence, Max cannot be a numpus without contradicting premise (5).\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation (16) is (1), (2), (4), (5), and (15).\n\n### Final Answer:\n(1),(2),(4),(5),(15)->(16)"}]
