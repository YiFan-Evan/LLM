(8) Alex is transparent. (10) Alex is a gorpus.]\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \nProve: (11) Alex is transparent and a gorpus.\n\n**Solution:** \nThis problem requires proving that Alex is both transparent and a gorpus. However, since there is no direct connection between being transparent and being a gorpus, and neither of these properties can be derived from the other, this proof obligation cannot be derived from the given premises. Therefore, it is impossible to prove this obligation.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:** \n[(2) Everything that is transparent and a jompus is an impus. (8) Alex is transparent. (14) Alex is dull.]\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \nProve: (15) Alex is an impus.\n\n**Solution:** \nThis problem requires proving that Alex is an impus. From the premises, we know Alex is transparent, but there is no direct connection to being a jompus or an impus without additional information about being a jompus. Therefore, it is impossible to prove this obligation directly from the given premises.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:** \n[(12) Alex is a brimpus. (14) Alex is dull. (6) Everything that is dull and a dumpus is a jompus. (15) Alex is a dumpus.]\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \nProve: (16) Alex is transparent and a jompus.\n\n**Solution:** \nThis problem requires proving that Alex is transparent and a jompus. We need to show that Alex is a jompus and then combine this with the fact that Alex is transparent. Given the premises, we can derive:\n\n- From (14) and (6), we can derive that Alex is a jompus.\n- We already have from (8) that Alex is transparent.\n\nCombining these, we get Alex is transparent and a jompus.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Premises:** \n[(1) Everything that is hot and a gorpus is a shumpus.
