Everything that is earthy or a gorpus is a jompus.\n2. Everything that is blue or a jompus is a wumpus.\n3. Everything that is nervous or a gorpus is a sterpus.\n4. Everything that is large or a tumpus is a gorpus.\n5. Everything that is moderate or a shumpus is a grimpus.\n6. Everything that is temperate or a tumpus is a brimpus.\n7.

Fae is a shumpus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \nProve: (10) Fae is blue or a jompus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (8), we know that Fae is a gorpus.\n- From premise (1), since Fae is a gorpus, it follows that Fae is a jompus (because \"Everything that is earthy or a gorpus is a jompus\").\n- Now, since Fae is a jompus, by premise (2), it follows that Fae is a wumpus (because \"Everything that is blue or a jompus is a wumpus\"). However, this is not necessary for our proof obligation.\n- We need to show that Fae is either blue or a jompus. Since Fae is already a jompus (from the above step), it satisfies the condition \"Fae is blue or a jompus\" without needing to prove Fae is blue.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (10) is (8) and (1).\n\n**Answer:** (8),(1)->(10)\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**\n1.

From premise (8), we know that Fae is a gorpus.\n2. Using premise (1), since Fae is a gorpus, it follows that Fae is a jompus (because \"Everything that is earthy or a gorpus is a jompus\").\n3. Since Fae is a jompus, by premise (2), it follows that Fae is a wumpus (because \"Everything that is blue or a jompus is a wumpus\"). However, this does not help us directly prove that Fae is blue or a jompus.\n4. Given that Fae is already a jompus (from the above step), we have satisfied one part of the condition \"Fae is blue or a jompus.\" Therefore, Fae is blue or a jompus, even if we do not need to prove Fae is blue specifically.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (10) is (8) and (1).\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(1)->(10)"}]
