Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Max's Classification:**\n   - From (23): Max is a yumpus.\n   - From (21): Every yumpus is a jompus. Therefore, Max is a jompus.\n   - From (22): Every tumpus is a dumpus. Therefore, since every yumpus is a tumpus (from (2)), Max is a tumpus and thus a dumpus.\n   - From (24): Max is a vumpus.\n\n2. **Tumpus Characteristics:**\n   - From (8): Tumpuses are numpuses. Therefore, since Max is a tumpus, Max is a numpus.\n   - From (3): Numpuses are rompuses. Therefore, Max is a rompus.\n   - From (9): Each rompus is a sterpus. Therefore, Max is a sterpus.\n\n3. **Sterpus Characteristics:**\n   - From (18): Sterpuses are brimpuses. Therefore, Max is a brimpus.\n   - From (19): Each sterpus is not large. Therefore, Max is not large.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe key steps involve identifying Max's classification as a yumpus, tumpus, numpus, rompus, and finally, a sterpus (which implies a brimpus). Since sterpuses are not large, Max cannot be large.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (23),(24)->(25)"}]
