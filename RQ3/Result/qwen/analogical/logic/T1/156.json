From (10) and (15), Alex is moderate and a rompus.\n2. From (7), since Alex is a rompus, it does not give us any new information about Alex being a brimpus or not.\n3. From (13), Alex is a gorpus.\n4. From (5), since Alex is bitter and a gorpus, Alex must be a brimpus.\n5. Therefore, Alex is a brimpus.\n6. Since Alex is already known to be moderate from (10), Alex is moderate and a brimpus.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (16) is:\n- (10) Alex is moderate.\n- (13) Alex is a gorpus.\n- (5) Everything that is bitter and a gorpus is a brimpus.\n- (15) Alex is a rompus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises is (10),(13),(5)->(16).\n\n### Problem 2\n**Premises:**\n- (1) Everything that is temperate and a gorpus is a jompus.\n- (2) Everything that is happy and an impus is a gorpus.\n- (3) Everything that is moderate and a brimpus is a dumpus.\n- (4) Everything that is luminous and a brimpus is a lempus.\n- (5) Everything that is bitter and a gorpus is a brimpus.\n- (6) Everything that is mean and an impus is a numpus.\n- (7) Everything that is muffled and a rompus is a lorpus.\n- (8) Alex is bitter.\n- (9) Alex is mean.\n- (10) Alex is moderate.\n- (11) Alex is happy.\n- (12) Alex is temperate.\n- (13) Alex is a gorpus.\n- (14) Alex is an impus.\n- (15) Alex is a rompus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \n- (16) Alex is moderate and a brimpus.\n\n### Solution to Problem 2\nWe follow similar steps as in Problem 1:\n\n1. From (10), Alex is moderate.\n2. From (13), Alex is a gorpus.\n3. From (5), since Alex is bitter and a gorpus, Alex must be a brimpus.\n4. Therefore, Alex is moderate and a brimpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed is (10),(13),(5)->(16).\n\n### Problem 3\n**Premises:**\n- (1) Everything that is temperate and a gorpus is a jompus.\n- (2) Everything that is happy and an impus is a gorpus.\n- (3) Everything that is moderate and a brimpus is a dumpus.\n- (4) Everything that is luminous and a brimpus is a lempus.\n- (5) Everything that is bitter and a gorpus is a brimpus.\n- (6) Everything that is mean and an impus is a numpus.\n- (7) Everything that is muffled and a rompus is a lorpus.\n- (8) Alex is bitter.\n- (9) Alex is mean.\n- (10) Alex is moderate.\n- (11) Alex is happy.\n- (12) Alex is temperate.\n- (13) Alex is a gorpus.\n- (14) Alex is an impus.\n- (15) Alex is a rompus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \n- (16) Alex is moderate and a brimpus.\n\n### Solution to Problem 3\nWe follow the same logical steps as before:\n\n1. From (10), Alex is moderate.\n2. From (13), Alex is a gorpus.\n3. From (5), since Alex is bitter and a gorpus, Alex must be a brimpus.\n4. Therefore, Alex is moderate and a brimpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed is (10),(13),(5)->(16).\n\n### Conclusion\nSince the minimal set of premises required to prove (16) in all three problems is the same, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(13),(5)->(16)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
