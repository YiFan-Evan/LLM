From (9), we know Polly is an impus and a vumpus.\n2. From (3), since shumpuses are impuses and vumpuses, Polly could be a shumpus.\n3. From (1), if Polly is a shumpus, she must also be a sterpus because each sterpus is a shumpus.\n4. Therefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove Polly is a sterpus is (1) and (3), leading to (10).\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**\n- (5) Gorpuses are sterpuses and wumpuses.\n- (8) Polly is a gorpus and a wumpus.\n- (7) Each wumpus is a zumpus and a rompus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:**\n- (10) Polly is a sterpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.
