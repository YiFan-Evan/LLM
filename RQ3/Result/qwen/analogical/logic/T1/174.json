However, this contradicts (13) because Sally is not a vumpus.\n4. Therefore, Sally cannot be a shumpus, which means our assumption that Sally is a shumpus needs to be reconsidered in light of the contradiction.\n5. From (12), Sally is a yumpus, a shumpus, and a jompus.\n6. From (1), numpuses are yumpuses, so Sally being a numpus means she is a yumpus.\n7. From (7), wumpuses are yumpuses, so if Sally were a wumpus, she would be a yumpus.\n8. From (10), wumpuses are rompuses, grimpuses, and vumpuses.\n9. From (9), every vumpus is a tumpus.\n10. From (13), Sally is not a vumpus, so she cannot be a tumpus, rompus, or grimpus.\n11. Therefore, Sally cannot be a wumpus (since being a wumpus requires being a rompus, grimpus, or vumpus).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove Sally is not a wumpus is: **(2), (11), (13), (10) -> (14)**\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(2),(11),(13),(10)->(14)**"}]
