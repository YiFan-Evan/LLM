Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and create three related but not identical problems.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:** \n(1) Gorpuses are dumpuses.\n(2) Dumpuses are not happy.\n(3) Each gorpus is a brimpus.\n(4) Impuses are tumpuses.\n(5) Each lempus is sweet.\n(6) Each gorpus is not large.\n(7) Sterpuses are not opaque.\n(8) Every dumpus is a sterpus.\n(9) Every jompus is a vumpus.\n(10) Every tumpus is a numpus.\n(11) Impuses are lempuses.\n(12) Tumpuses are not metallic.\n(13) Each jompus is red.\n(14) Brimpuses are not melodic.\n(15) Impuses are mean.\n(16) Every dumpus is a zumpus.\n(17) Each numpus is windy.\n(18) Every tumpus is a gorpus.\n(19) Rex is an impus.\n(20) Rex is a jompus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \n(21) Rex is not large.\n\n**Solution:** \nFrom (19) and (20), we know Rex is both an impus and a jompus. From (11), impuses are lempuses, so Rex is a lempus. However, we need to find a connection between Rex and gorpuses or dumpuses to use (6). From (18), every tumpus is a gorpus. From (4), impuses are tumpuses, so Rex is a tumpus and therefore a gorpus. From (6), each gorpus is not large. Therefore, Rex is not large.\n\nThe solution to Problem 1 is: (19),(20),(11),(18),(6)->(21).\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:** \n(1) Gorpuses are dumpuses.\n(2) Dumpuses are not happy.\n(3) Each gorpus is a brimpus.\n(4) Impuses are tumpuses.\n(5) Each lempus is sweet.\n(6) Each gorpus is not large.\n(7) Sterpuses are not opaque.\n(8) Every dumpus is a sterpus.\n(9) Every jompus is a vumpus.\n(10) Every tumpus is a numpus.\n(11) Impuses are lempuses.\n(12) Tumpuses are not metallic.\n(13) Each jompus is red.\n(14) Brimpuses are not melodic.\n(15) Impuses are mean.\n(16) Every dumpus is a zumpus.\n(17) Each numpus is windy.\n(18) Every tumpus is a gorpus.\n(19) Rex is an impus.\n(20) Rex is a jompus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \n(21) Rex is not large.\n\n**Solution:** \nFrom (19) and (20), Rex is both an impus and a jompus.
