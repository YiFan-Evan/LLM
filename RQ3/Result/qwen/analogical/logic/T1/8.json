Hence, Wren cannot be a lorpus or a zumpus.\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe key premises needed to derive the proof obligation are Premises (3) and (4). Premise (5) about Wren not being a vumpus is irrelevant to the proof obligation about zumpus and lorpus.\n\nThus, the solution is:\n\n(3),(4)->(6)\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (3),(4)->(6)."}]
