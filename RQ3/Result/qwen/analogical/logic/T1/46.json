Here\u2019s a step-by-step analysis:\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n   - Premises (1) through (10) describe various characteristics and relationships of different types of creatures.\n   - Premise (9) states that Polly is bright, dull, a numpus, and a dumpus.\n   - Premise (10) states that Polly is sweet, spicy, a gorpus, and a lorpus.\n\n2. **Relevant Premises for Polly Being a Yumpus**:\n   - From (9), Polly is a numpus and a dumpus.\n   - From (4), since Polly is a dumpus, she could also be a yumpus.\n   - From (3), yumpuses are blue, red, jompuses, and lempuses.\n   - From (8), each lempus is a sterpus and a rompus.\n   - From (10), Polly is sweet, spicy, a gorpus, and a lorpus, which implies she is a sterpus and a lorpus.\n   - From (8), since Polly is a lorpus, she could be a lempus.\n   - From (3), since Polly could be a lempus, she could be a yumpus.\n\n3. **Verification of Yumpus Attributes**:\n   - To conclusively state that Polly is a yumpus, we need to ensure that Polly has the attributes of a yumpus: blue, red, jompuses, and lempuses.\n   - Polly being a lempus (from (8)) is sufficient to infer that she could be a yumpus (since lempuses are part of yumpuses).\n   - We do not have explicit information about Polly being blue or red or a jompus, but we can infer from her attributes and the relationships described.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the premises provided, we can deduce that Polly could be a yumpus because she meets the criteria of being a lempus, which is one of the components of yumpuses.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(9),(10)->(11)**"}]
