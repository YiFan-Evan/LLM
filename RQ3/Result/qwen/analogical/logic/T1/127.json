According to premise 2, a shumpus must have the attributes feisty, shy, nervous, happy, and a jompus. However, Rex does not have these attributes (he is mean, angry, amenable, aggressive). Since Rex is a shumpus, it implies that he must have all the necessary attributes to be a shumpus, but we do not need to derive this specific obligation from the given premises.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:** \n- (1) Everything that is brown, orange, blue, red, and a lorpus is a grimpus.\n- (2) Everything that is feisty, shy, nervous, happy, and a jompus is a shumpus.\n- (4) Everything that is mean, amenable, angry, aggressive, and a shumpus is a lorpus.\n- (8) Rex is mean.\n- (9) Rex is a shumpus.\n- (18) Rex is angry.\n- (19) Rex is amenable.\n- (20) Rex is aggressive.\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \n- (21) Rex is mean, angry, amenable, aggressive, and a lorpus.\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom premises 8, 18, 19, and 20, we know that Rex has the attributes mean, angry, amenable, and aggressive.

Therefore, we cannot prove the obligation based on the given premises.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nTo prove that Rex is luminous, liquid, metallic, wooden, and a lorpus, we need to use premises 10, 12, 13, 17, and 9.\n\n- Premise 10: Rex is metallic.\n- Premise 12: Rex is luminous.\n- Premise 13: Rex is liquid.\n- Premise 17: Rex is wooden.\n- Premise 9: Rex is a shumpus.\n\nCombining these, we can use premise 4 (Everything that is mean, amenable, angry, aggressive, and a shumpus is a lorpus) to conclude that Rex is a lorpus. However, we need to ensure that Rex has all the necessary attributes to be a lorpus.\n\nSince Rex is not directly described as having the necessary attributes for a lorpus (brown, orange, blue, red), we can only conclude that Rex is luminous, liquid, metallic, and wooden, but we cannot definitively conclude that Rex is a lorpus from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(10),(12),(13),(17),(9)->(21)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
