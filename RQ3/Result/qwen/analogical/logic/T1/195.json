Therefore, Sam is a tumpus.\n   - From premise (4), every tumpus is metallic. Therefore, Sam is metallic.\n   - From premise (1), every zumpus is a dumpus. Therefore, Sam is a dumpus.\n   - From premise (2), every dumpus is a jompus. Therefore, Sam is a jompus.\n   - From premise (16), every jompus is a numpus. Therefore, Sam is a numpus.\n\n3. **Use the premises about numpuses to conclude that Sam is not bitter:**\n   - From premise (10), numpuses are not bitter.
