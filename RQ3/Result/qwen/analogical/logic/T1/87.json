You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

However, since Sally is also a wumpus (from (11)), we use (2): everything that is large or a wumpus is a dumpus.\n- Since Sally is a wumpus, she is a dumpus.\n- We need to show that Sally is either brown or a vumpus. Since we already have (5) stating that if Sally is a brimpus, she must be rainy or a vumpus, and we know Sally is a wumpus, it implies she is a vumpus (because brimpus is already established).\n- Therefore, Sally is a vumpus, which satisfies the condition of being brown or a vumpus.\n\n**Answer:** (10),(11)->(12)\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**\n(1) Everything that is discordant or a lorpus is a lempus.\n(2) Everything that is large or a wumpus is a dumpus.\n(3) Everything that is dull or a lorpus is a brimpus.\n(4) Everything that is temperate or a vumpus is a tumpus.\n(5) Everything that is rainy or a brimpus is a vumpus.\n(6) Everything that is brown or a vumpus is a shumpus.\n(7) Everything that is slow or a gorpus is a lorpus.\n(8) Everything that is feisty or a gorpus is a numpus.\n(9) Everything that is opaque or a brimpus is a zumpus.\n(10) Sally is a brimpus.\n(11) Sally is a wumpus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \n(12) Sally is brown or a vumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (10), Sally is a brimpus.\n- From (5), Sally is either rainy or a vumpus.\n- From (11), Sally is a wumpus.\n- Using (2), since Sally is a wumpus, she is a dumpus.\n- We already know from (5) that Sally is either rainy or a vumpus.\n- Since Sally is a vumpus, it satisfies the condition of being brown or a vumpus.\n\n**Answer:** (10),(11)->(12)\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**\n(1) Everything that is discordant or a lorpus is a lempus.\n(2) Everything that is large or a wumpus is a dumpus.\n(3) Everything that is dull or a lorpus is a brimpus.\n(4) Everything that is temperate or a vumpus is a tumpus.\n(5) Everything that is rainy or a brimpus is a vumpus.\n(6) Everything that is brown or a vumpus is a shumpus.\n(7) Everything that is slow or a gorpus is a lorpus.\n(8) Everything that is feisty or a gorpus is a numpus.\n(9) Everything that is opaque or a brimpus is a zumpus.\n(10) Sally is a brimpus.\n(11) Sally is a wumpus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:** \n(12) Sally is brown or a vumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (10), Sally is a brimpus.\n- From (5), Sally is either rainy or a vumpus.\n- From (11), Sally is a wumpus.\n- Using (2), since Sally is a wumpus, she is a dumpus.\n- We need to show that Sally is either brown or a vumpus.\n- Since Sally is a brimpus and brimpus implies she is either rainy or a vumpus, and she is a vumpus, the condition is satisfied.\n\n**Answer:** (10),(11)->(12)\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(11)->(12)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
