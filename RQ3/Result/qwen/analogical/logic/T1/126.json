We'll create three similar but distinct problems to illustrate different aspects of the logic involved.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Numpuses are orange and vumpuses and lempuses.  \n(2) Each grimpus is loud and a numpus.  \n(3) Sterpuses are transparent and brimpuses and dumpuses.  \n(4) Gorpuses are moderate and wumpuses and impuses.  \n(5) Lempuses are floral, gorpuses, and sterpuses.  \n(6) Dumpuses are temperate and jompuses and tumpuses.  \n(7) Every vumpus is sour and a shumpus and a rompus.  \n(8) Every zumpus is happy, shy, and a yumpus.  \n(9) Alex is temperate and a jompus and a tumpus.  \n(10) Alex is orange, a lempus, and a gorpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(11) Alex is a sterpus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFirst, note that Alex is a lempus (from premise 10). From premise 5, we know that lempuses are also sterpuses. Therefore, Alex is a sterpus.  \nThus, the answer is: **(1),(10)->(11)**\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Numpuses are orange and vumpuses and lempuses.  \n(2) Each grimpus is loud and a numpus.  \n(3) Sterpuses are transparent and brimpuses and dumpuses.  \n(4) Gorpuses are moderate and wumpuses and impuses.  \n(5) Lempuses are floral, gorpuses, and sterpuses.  \n(6) Dumpuses are temperate and jompuses and tumpuses.  \n(7) Every vumpus is sour and a shumpus and a rompus.  \n(8) Every zumpus is happy, shy, and a yumpus.  \n(9) Alex is temperate and a jompus and a tumpus.  \n(10) Alex is orange, a lempus, and a gorpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(11) Alex is a dumpus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom premise 6, we know that dumpuses are temperate and jompuses and tumpuses. Since Alex is temperate, a jompus, and a tumpus (from premise 9), Alex fits the definition of a dumpus. Therefore, Alex is a dumpus.  \nThus, the answer is: **(6),(9)->(11)**\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Numpuses are orange and vumpuses and lempuses.  \n(2) Each grimpus is loud and a numpus.  \n(3) Sterpuses are transparent and brimpuses and dumpuses.  \n(4) Gorpuses are moderate and wumpuses and impuses.  \n(5) Lempuses are floral, gorpuses, and sterpuses.  \n(6) Dumpuses are temperate and jompuses and tumpuses.  \n(7) Every vumpus is sour and a shumpus and a rompus.  \n(8) Every zumpus is happy, shy, and a yumpus.  \n(9) Alex is temperate and a jompus and a tumpus.  \n(10) Alex is orange, a lempus, and a gorpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(11) Alex is a lempus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThis is straightforward because premise 10 directly states that Alex is a lempus.  \nThus, the answer is: **(10)->(11)**\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Numpuses are orange and vumpuses and lempuses.  \n(2) Each grimpus is loud and a numpus.  \n(3) Sterpuses are transparent and brimpuses and dumpuses.  \n(4) Gorpuses are moderate and wumpuses and impuses.  \n(5) Lempuses are floral, gorpuses, and sterpuses.  \n(6) Dumpuses are temperate and jompuses and tumpuses.  \n(7) Every vumpus is sour and a shumpus and a rompus.  \n(8) Every zumpus is happy, shy, and a yumpus.  \n(9) Alex is temperate and a jompus and a tumpus.  \n(10) Alex is orange, a lempus, and a gorpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(11) Alex is a sterpus.\n\n**Solution:**  \nSince Alex is a lempus (premise 10) and lempuses are also sterpuses (premise 5), Alex is a sterpus.  \nThus, the answer is: **(1),(10)->(11)**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(10)->(11)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
