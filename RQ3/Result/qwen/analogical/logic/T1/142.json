Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and create three related but distinct problems.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:**\n1. Stella is a zumpus.\n2. Each tumpus is a wumpus.\n3. Each sterpus is a wumpus.\n4. Jompuses are zumpuses.\n5. Impuses are wumpuses.\n6. Gorpuses are dumpuses.\n7. Each impus is a lorpus and a tumpus and a grimpus.\n8. Grimpuses are rompuses.\n9.

Stella is a sterpus, Stella is not a lorpus, and Stella is a jompus.\n\n**Prove:** Stella is not a gorpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (1), Stella is a zumpus.\n- From (9), since Stella is a zumpus, she is also a lorpus.\n- However, from (12), Stella is not a lorpus.\n- Therefore, Stella cannot be a zumpus if it conflicts with (12). But we know (1) is true, so we need to find another contradiction.\n- From (10), every gorpus is an impus.\n- From (7), each impus is a lorpus.\n- From (12), Stella is not a lorpus.\n- Therefore, Stella cannot be an impus.\n- Since every gorpus is an impus (from (10)), Stella cannot be a gorpus.\n\nSo, the answer is: **(1),(10),(12)->(13)**\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**\n1. Stella is a zumpus.\n2. Each tumpus is a wumpus.\n3. Each sterpus is a wumpus.\n4. Jompuses are zumpuses.\n5. Impuses are wumpuses.\n6. Gorpuses are dumpuses.\n7.

Stella is a zumpus.\n2. Each tumpus is a wumpus.\n3. Each sterpus is a wumpus.\n4. Jompuses are zumpuses.\n5. Impuses are wumpuses.\n6. Gorpuses are dumpuses.\n7.

Stella is a zumpus.\n2. Each tumpus is a wumpus.\n3. Each sterpus is a wumpus.\n4. Jompuses are zumpuses.\n5. Impuses are wumpuses.\n6. Gorpuses are dumpuses.\n7.

Stella is a sterpus, Stella is not a lorpus, and Stella is a jompus.\n\n### Proof Steps:\n1. From premise (11), Stella is a zumpus.\n2. From premise (9), since Stella is a zumpus, Stella is also a lorpus.\n3. However, from premise (12), Stella is not a lorpus.\n4. This creates a contradiction if Stella were an impus because from premise (7), each impus is a lorpus.\n5. From premise (10), every gorpus is an impus.\n6. Hence, if Stella were a gorpus, she would have to be an impus.\n7. But being an impus would mean she is a lorpus, which contradicts premise (12).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe contradiction arises when Stella is assumed to be a gorpus. Therefore, Stella cannot be a gorpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises required to derive the proof obligation is:\n**(1),(9),(10),(12)->(13)**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(9),(10),(12)->(13)**"}]
