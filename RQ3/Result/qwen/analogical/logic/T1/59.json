Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. We need to show that Alex is orange and red and a grimpus.\n2. To do this, we need to establish that Alex is both orange and red, and that Alex is a grimpus.\n\n### Steps to Proof:\n1. **Alex is orange and red**: This is directly given by Premises (8) and (9).\n2. **Alex is a grimpus**: We need to use Premise (1) which states that everything that is angry, aggressive, and a shumpus is a grimpus. Since Premise (14) tells us that Alex is angry and Premise (13) tells us that Alex is aggressive, we need to establish that Alex is also a shumpus.\n3. **Alex is a shumpus**: This is given by Premise (15).\n\nGiven these steps, we can derive the necessary sequence of premises:\n\n1. From Premise (14): Alex is angry.\n2. From Premise (13): Alex is aggressive.\n3. From Premise (15): Alex is a shumpus.\n4. Using Premise (1), since Alex is angry, aggressive, and a shumpus, Alex is a grimpus.\n5. From Premises (8) and (9): Alex is orange and red.\n\nThus, we have shown that Alex is orange and red and a grimpus using Premises (14), (13), and (15).\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (14),(13),(15)->(16)"}]
