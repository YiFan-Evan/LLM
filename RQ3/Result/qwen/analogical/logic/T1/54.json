Let's break down the problem into simpler parts.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is spicy, sour, or a numpus is a tumpus.  \n(2) Everything that is orange, red, or a brimpus is a zumpus.  \n(12) Max is a brimpus.  \n(13) Max is a yumpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \nProve: (14) Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus.  \n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom premise (12), we know Max is a brimpus.

From premise (13), we know Max is a yumpus. From premise (4), we know that everything that is wooden or luminous or a sterpus is a yumpus. This means Max could be wooden, luminous, or a sterpus. But again, this doesn't directly help us to prove that Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus. We need another premise that connects yumpus to vumpus. From premise (10), we know that everything that is nervous, shy, or a yumpus is a vumpus. Since we don't have any information about Max being nervous or shy, we cannot conclude that Max is a vumpus from this alone. However, premise (10) is not necessary if we can use premise (7) and (10) together. Premise (7) states that everything that is small or large or a vumpus is a lempus. This doesn't help either. The key is premise (10) combined with premise (13) which tells us that Max is a yumpus, and premise (10) tells us that everything that is nervous, shy, or a yumpus is a vumpus. Since we don't have information about nervous or shy, we need premise (6) which states that everything that is earthy or fruity or a vumpus is a numpus. Since Max is a yumpus, and premise (10) implies Max could be a vumpus, and premise (6) implies that if Max is a vumpus, then Max is a numpus.
