However, we know from (5) that Rex is not a shumpus. Therefore, Rex cannot be a tumpus.  \nFrom (1), if Rex were an impus, then Rex would also be a shumpus. Again, we know from (5) that Rex is not a shumpus. Therefore, Rex cannot be an impus.  \nSince Rex is neither a tumpus nor an impus, we can conclude that Rex is not a tumpus and Rex is not an impus.

However, we know from (1) that if Rex were an impus or a tumpus, then Rex would also be a shumpus. Since we know from (5) that Rex is not a shumpus, Rex cannot be an impus or a tumpus.

Specifically, (1) establishes the relationship between being an impus or tumpus and being a shumpus, and (5) tells us that Rex is not a shumpus.
