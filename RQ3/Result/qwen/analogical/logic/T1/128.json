Therefore, we cannot conclude that Wren is sweet, spicy, sour, and a brimpus.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**\n[(3) Everything that is sweet, spicy, sour, and a brimpus is a zumpus.\n(9) Wren is sour.\n(12) Wren is sweet.\n(13) Wren is earthy.\n(14) Wren is spicy.\n(16) Wren is a rompus.]\n\n**Proof Obligation:**\n(17) Wren is sweet, spicy, sour, and a brimpus.\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom premises (9), (12), and (14), we know that Wren is sour, sweet, and spicy. We also know from premise (16) that Wren is a rompus. However, we need to establish that Wren is a brimpus.
