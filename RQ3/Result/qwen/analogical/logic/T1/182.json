Stella is not happy.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (23), Stella is a gorpus.\n- From premise (17), every gorpus is a grimpus, so Stella is a grimpus.\n- From premise (5), every grimpus is a shumpus, so Stella is a shumpus.\n- From premise (18), every shumpus is not mean, so Stella is not mean.\n- From premise (24), Stella is a zumpus.\n- From premise (7), every zumpus is a numpus, so Stella is a numpus.\n- From premise (19), every dumpus is not happy, but we don't have a direct connection from Stella being a zumpus to her being a dumpus. However, since we need to prove Stella is not happy, and every dumpus is not happy, we need to find a way to connect Stella to dumpuses indirectly.\n- Premise (3) states that dumpuses are rompuses.
