Everything that is large, small, or a yumpus is a wumpus.\n2. Everything that is dull, bright, or a rompus is a lempus.\n3. Everything that is orange or blue or a rompus is a grimpus.\n4. Everything that is kind, angry, or a grimpus is a yumpus.\n5. Everything that is transparent or opaque or a grimpus is a zumpus.\n6. Everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus.\n7. Everything that is happy, shy, or a jompus is a tumpus.\n8. Everything that is sour or bitter or a shumpus is an impus.\n9. Everything that is fruity, floral, or a jompus is a gorpus.\n10. Everything that is overcast, sunny, or a vumpus is a sterpus.\n11. Everything that is moderate or slow or a vumpus is a jompus.\n12. Fae is a grimpus.\n13. Fae is a shumpus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:**\nProve: (14) Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (12), we know Fae is a grimpus.\n- From premise (4), since Fae is a grimpus, it follows that Fae is either kind, angry, or a yumpus.\n- Since Fae is a shumpus (premise 13), we need to find a way to connect this with the yumpus.\n- From premise (6), we see that if Fae were a yumpus, then Fae would be luminous or metallic or a vumpus.\n- However, we do not have direct information linking Fae being a shumpus directly to luminous, metallic, or yumpus. Instead, we need to check if there's any other connection.\n- From premise (8), since Fae is a shumpus, it means Fae is either sour or bitter or an impus.\n- We need to show that Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus. Since we already established that Fae could be a yumpus through premise (4), we conclude Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (14) is (12) and (4).\n\n**Answer:** (12),(4)->(14)\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**\n1.

Fae is a grimpus.\n13. Fae is a shumpus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:**\nProve: (14) Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (12), we know Fae is a grimpus.\n- From premise (4), since Fae is a grimpus, it follows that Fae is either kind, angry, or a yumpus.\n- From premise (6), we see that if Fae were a yumpus, then Fae would be luminous or metallic or a vumpus.\n- From premise (8), since Fae is a shumpus, it means Fae is either sour or bitter or an impus.\n- Since we established Fae could be a yumpus through premise (4), we conclude Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (14) is (12) and (4).\n\n**Answer:** (12),(4)->(14)\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**\n1.
