Since Sam is already a brimpus, the statement \"Sam is snowy or a brimpus\" is true because it includes \"brimpus\" as one of the conditions.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed is (1) and (6).\n\n**Answer:** (1),(6)->(8)\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:** \n1.

From premise (1), since Sam is a lempus, Sam must be a brimpus (because everything that is a lempus is included in the condition \"or a lempus\").\n3. Since Sam is a brimpus, the statement \"Sam is snowy or a brimpus\" is true because it includes \"brimpus\" as one of the conditions.\n\nThus, we do not need to use any other premises except (1) and (6) to prove the statement about Sam.\n\n### Solution:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove the statement is (1) and (6).\n\n**Answer:** (1),(6)->(8)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(6)->(8)"}]
