From premise (9), we know that Stella is a vumpus.\n2. According to premise (2), if something is a vumpus, it is also a yumpus, an impus, and a lorpus.\n3. Since Stella is a vumpus, we can conclude that Stella is a yumpus, an impus, and a lorpus.\n4. Therefore, Stella is a lorpus.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises Needed:\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Stella is a lorpus involves the premises that directly establish Stella as a vumpus and the definition of vumpuses as being yumpuses, impuses, and lorpus.\n\n- Premise (9) establishes Stella as a vumpus.\n- Premise (2) defines the properties of vumpuses.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises is (9) and (2).\n\n**Answer:**  \n(9),(2)->(10)"}]
