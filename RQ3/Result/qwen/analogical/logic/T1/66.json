Since there is no information about whether Rex is temperate or not, we cannot directly conclude from (3) alone.\n- From (7), we know Rex is a sterpus.\n- From (1), everything that is a sterpus is an impus. So Rex is an impus.\n- We need to show Rex is either kind or a rompus. Since Rex is already known to be a gorpus from (6), and from (3), everything that is a gorpus is a rompus, Rex is a rompus.\n- Therefore, Rex is kind or a rompus (since being a rompus satisfies the \"or\" condition).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises required is (6) and (7), leading to (8).\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is floral or a sterpus is an impus.  \n(2) Everything that is kind or a rompus is a brimpus.  \n(3) Everything that is temperate or a gorpus is a rompus.  \n(4) Everything that is opaque or a rompus is a shumpus.  \n(5) Everything that is fast or a gorpus is a lempus.  \n(6) Rex is a gorpus.  \n(7) Rex is a sterpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(9) Rex is a brimpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (6), Rex is a gorpus.\n- From (3), since Rex is a gorpus, Rex is a rompus (since there is no information about temperate).\n- From (2), everything that is kind or a rompus is a brimpus. Since Rex is a rompus, Rex is a brimpus.\n- Therefore, the minimal set of premises required is (6) and (7), leading to (9).\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Premises:**  \n(1) Everything that is floral or a sterpus is an impus.  \n(2) Everything that is kind or a rompus is a brimpus.  \n(3) Everything that is temperate or a gorpus is a rompus.  \n(4) Everything that is opaque or a rompus is a shumpus.  \n(5) Everything that is fast or a gorpus is a lempus.  \n(6) Rex is a gorpus.  \n(7) Rex is a sterpus.  \n\n**Proof Obligation:**  \n(10) Rex is a shumpus.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From (6), Rex is a gorpus.\n- From (3), since Rex is a gorpus, Rex is a rompus (since there is no information about temperate).\n- From (4), since Rex is a rompus, Rex is a shumpus.\n- Therefore, the minimal set of premises required is (6) and (7), leading to (10).\n\n### Final Answer:\nSince the proof obligation (8) can be derived using premises (6) and (7), the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{(6),(7)->(8)}\n\\]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
