Let's look at three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9]]}\n**Start Node**: 0\n**Destination**: 9\n\n**Solution**:\nUsing BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the shortest path from node 0 to node 9.
