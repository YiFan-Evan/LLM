Let's analyze three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n- **Graph**: Same as the original.\n- **Start Node**: 1\n- **Destination**: 10\n\n**Solution**:\nWe need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 10. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm or breadth-first search (BFS) for this purpose.\n\nStarting at node 1, the shortest path to node 10 is through node 9 and then node 8.
