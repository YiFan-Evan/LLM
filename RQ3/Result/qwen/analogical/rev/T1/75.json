These problems will involve different graphs, start nodes, and destination nodes, but they will all use the same basic approach of finding the shortest path using a suitable algorithm (such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search for unweighted graphs).\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 1\n**Destination Node:** 3\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3.\n\nBy analyzing the graph, we can see that the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 involves the following steps:\n1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 (not reaching 3)\n1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 (not reaching 3)\n1 -> 2 -> 4 (not reaching 3)\n1 -> 2 (not reaching 3)\nSo the shortest path is actually:\n1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 7 (but not reaching 3 directly)\n\nHowever, since there is no direct connection between any of these nodes and node 3, we need to re-evaluate the graph and connections. There is no direct path from node 1 to node 3 in this graph.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6], [1, 3]]}\n**Start Node:** 1\n**Destination Node:** 3\n\n**Solution:**  \nNow, the graph has a direct edge from node 1 to node 3, so the shortest path is simply:\n1 -> 3\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6], [1, 3], [3, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 1\n**Destination Node:** 6\n\n**Solution:**  \nIn this case, we need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6. The possible paths are:\n1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6\n1 -> 3 -> 6\n\nThe shortest path here is:\n1 -> 3 -> 6\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 1\n**Destination Node:** 3\n\nFrom the analysis of the original graph, there is no direct path from node 1 to node 3. We can see that the closest nodes to 3 are 5 and 7, but there are no paths connecting 1 to these nodes directly or through other nodes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: No path exists from node 1 to node 3 in the given graph. However, if we strictly follow the format requested:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: No path exists. \n\nSince the format requires a path and none exists, we can't provide a valid path.
