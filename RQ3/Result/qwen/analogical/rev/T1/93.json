From node 8, the connections are to nodes 12 and 7. From node 11, the connections are to nodes 5 and 4. To reach node 10, we need to look further.\n\nFrom node 8, the next step could be to node 12 or node 7. Neither of these directly connects to node 10. From node 11, we can go to node 5 or node 4. Node 4 has a connection to node 9, which in turn connects to node 10. Therefore, the shortest path involves going from node 6 to node 8, then to node 9, and finally to node 10.\n\n**Solution:** 6->8->9->10\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->8->9->10"}]
