Here are three such problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 7], [5, 6]]}  \n**Start Node:** 3  \n**Destination:** 7  \n\n**Solution:**  \nTo find the shortest path from node 3 to node 7, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or breadth-first search (BFS). Starting at node 3, we see that the direct edge goes to node 5. From node 5, the next step is to node 6, and finally to node 7. Thus, the shortest path is 3->5->7.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 7], [5, 6]]}  \n**Start Node:** 1  \n**Destination:** 6  \n\n**Solution:**  \nStarting at node 1, we can reach node 4 directly. From node 4, we can go to node 7, and then from node 7 to node 6. Alternatively, we could go through node 3 and then to node 5, and finally to node 6.
