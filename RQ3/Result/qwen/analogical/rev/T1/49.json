Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 4], [5, 7], [6, 7]]}  \n**Start Node:** 5  \n**Destination:** 4\n\n**Solution:** To find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS). By tracing the paths manually or using an algorithm, we see that the shortest path is 5->7->4.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 4], [5, 7], [6, 7]]}  \n**Start Node:** 2  \n**Destination:** 7\n\n**Solution:** For the shortest path from node 2 to node 7, we can trace the connections.
