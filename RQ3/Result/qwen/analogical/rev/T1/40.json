Here are three related but not identical problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 4], [5, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 4\n**Destination:** 1\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe need to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 1. By examining the edges, we can see that there is no direct path from 4 to 1. We would have to go through node 0 or 3. However, since there is no edge from 0 to 1 or from 3 to 1, it is impossible to reach node 1 from node 4.\n\n**Answer:** There is no path from 4 to 1.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 4], [5, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 3\n**Destination:** 7\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe need to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 7. From the edges, we can see that node 3 connects directly to node 1, and node 1 connects directly to node 7. Therefore, the shortest path is 3->1->7.\n\n**Answer:** 3->1->7\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 4], [5, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 2\n**Destination:** 5\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe need to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 5.
