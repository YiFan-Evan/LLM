Here, BFS would be more straightforward because all edges have the same weight.\n\nStarting from node 0, we explore its neighbors:\n- Node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 2.\n- From node 1, we can reach node 7.\n- From node 2, no direct connection to node 6.\n- From node 7, no direct connection to node 6.\n- From node 1, we then go to node 7, and from node 7, we cannot directly reach node 6.\n\nWe continue exploring other nodes:\n- From node 2, no further connections lead us closer to node 6.\n- From node 3, no direct connection.\n- From node 4, no direct connection.\n- From node 5, we can directly reach node 6.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 0 to node 6 is 0->5->6.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 7], [5, 6], [6, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 3  \n**Destination:** 7\n\n**Solution:**  \nFrom node 3, we can directly connect to nodes 4 and 7.
