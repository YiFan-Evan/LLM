Instead, we can go through node 12:\n- From node 6 to node 12 (since there is an edge [6, 12])\n- From node 12 to node 8 (since there is an edge [8, 12])\n- From node 8 to node 13 (since there is an edge [8, 13])\n- From node 13 to node 9 (since there is an edge [9, 13])\n- From node 9 to node 5 (since there is an edge [9, 13])\n\nThus, the shortest path is:\n6->12->8->13->9->5\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->12->8->13->9->5"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 3], [0, 7], [1, 11], [2, 5], [2, 11], [3, 11], [6, 12], [6, 7], [7, 14], [8, 13], [8, 12], [9, 13], [10, 12]]} The end node: 5 The start node: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem of finding the shortest path from node 6 to node 5 in the given graph, we can use a shortest path algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm.
