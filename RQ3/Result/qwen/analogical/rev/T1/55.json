Here are three such problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 2\n**Destination:** 3\n\n**Solution:** We need to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3. By examining the graph, we see there is a direct edge between node 2 and node 3. Therefore, the shortest path is simply 2->3.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 2\n**Destination:** 7\n\n**Solution:** To go from node 2 to node 7, we can follow the direct edge between these two nodes.
