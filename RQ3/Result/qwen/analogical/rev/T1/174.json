We'll then apply these insights to find the shortest path for the given problem.\n\n### Problem 1: Simple Path Finding\n\n**Description**: Given a graph with nodes and edges, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 22.\n- **Graph**: Same as provided.\n- **Start Node**: 1\n- **Target Node**: 22\n\n**Solution**: By examining the graph, we can see that there are direct connections between nodes. For instance, node 1 connects directly to nodes 8 and 17. Node 17 further connects to node 22 via node 15. Therefore, one possible shortest path is:\n1 -> 17 -> 22\n\n### Problem 2: Path Finding with Intermediate Nodes\n\n**Description**: Find the shortest path from node 10 to node 24, considering intermediate nodes.\n- **Graph**: Same as provided.\n- **Start Node**: 10\n- **Target Node**: 24\n\n**Solution**: Node 10 connects to node 22, which then connects to node 24 through node 17. Alternatively, node 10 connects directly to node 24. Thus, the shortest path is:\n10 -> 24\n\n### Problem 3: Complex Path Finding with Multiple Connections\n\n**Description**: Determine the shortest path from node 12 to node 18, using any available intermediate nodes.\n- **Graph**: Same as provided.\n- **Start Node**: 12\n- **Target Node**: 18\n\n**Solution**: Node 12 connects directly to node 18.
