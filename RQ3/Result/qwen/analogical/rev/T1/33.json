Here are three related but not identical problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Shortest Path in a Directed Graph\n**Description:** Given a directed graph with nodes labeled from 0 to 6 and edges connecting these nodes, find the shortest path from node 5 to node 6.\n**Solution:** Use Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS) since all edges have equal weight. BFS is more straightforward for unweighted graphs.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path in an Undirected Graph\n**Description:** If the graph was undirected (meaning edges can be traversed in both directions), find the shortest path from node 5 to node 6.\n**Solution:** Since the graph given is already undirected, the solution would be similar to Problem 1. BFS would still be used.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path with Weighted Edges\n**Description:** Suppose each edge in the graph has a weight (for example, all weights are 1). Find the shortest path from node 5 to node 6.\n**Solution:** Use Dijkstra's algorithm if weights are non-negative. However, since all weights are 1, BFS can also be used.\n\nNow, let's solve the original problem using BFS since all edges are considered to have equal weight.\n\n1. Start at node 5.\n2. Explore its neighbors (node 7).\n3. Explore the neighbors of those neighbors (node 4 and node 1).\n4.
