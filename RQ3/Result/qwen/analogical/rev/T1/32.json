These problems will help us understand how to apply the shortest path algorithm in various contexts.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [5, 6], [5, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 1\n**Destination:** 7\n\n**Solution:**\nTo find the shortest path from node 1 to node 7, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or breadth-first search (BFS).
