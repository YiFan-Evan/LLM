Therefore, the shortest path would be the direct connection.\n- **Solution:** 6->14\n\n**Problem 2:** Find the shortest path from node 7 to node 10.\n- **Description:** Node 7 is connected to node 11, which has no direct path to node 10. Node 10 is connected to both nodes 12 and 14. We need to find the shortest path through other nodes.\n- **Solution:** The shortest path could involve going through node 14 or node 12. By tracing connections, we might find 7->11->9->5->4->6->14->10 as a possible path. However, checking all paths shows that 7->9->5->4->6->10 is shorter.\n- **Solution:** 7->9->5->4->6->10\n\n**Problem 3:** Find the shortest path from node 2 to node 10.\n- **Description:** Node 2 connects to nodes 8 and 5. Node 5 connects to nodes 9 and 4, and so on. We need to trace paths from node 2 to node 10.\n- **Solution:** The shortest path might go through several intermediate nodes.
