Start BFS from the source node.\n2. Track the path from the source to each node.\n3. Stop BFS when reaching the destination node.\n4. Reconstruct the path from source to destination.\n\n### Problem 2: Finding the Shortest Path Using Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** \nGiven a graph where all edge weights are equal, use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a start node to a destination node.\n\n**Solution Approach:**\n1. Initialize distances to infinity for all nodes except the start node.\n2. Use a priority queue to process nodes based on their current shortest distance.\n3.
