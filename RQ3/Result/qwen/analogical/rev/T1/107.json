Therefore, the shortest path is 0->3.\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 0]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 2\n\n**Solution:** \nHere, we have another circular graph. To go from 0 to 2, the shortest path would be either 0->1->2 or 0->4->3->2. Since both paths are equally short (both being of length 2), we can choose one of them. For example, 0->1->2.\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 0]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 4\n\n**Solution:** \nIn this graph, to go from 0 to 4, the shortest path is 0->1->2->3->4.
