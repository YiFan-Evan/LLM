Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Shortest Path with BFS\n**Description:** Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.\n**Solution:** \nWe can implement BFS to explore all nodes level by level until we reach the destination node. This method ensures we find the shortest path since BFS explores nodes in increasing order of their distance from the source.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path with Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph where all edge weights are positive.\n**Solution:** \nSince our graph is unweighted, we can treat it as a weighted graph with all edge weights being 1. Dijkstra's algorithm would still work, but BFS would be more efficient for unweighted graphs.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path with Bellman-Ford Algorithm\n**Description:** Use Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph that may contain negative weight edges.\n**Solution:** \nOur graph does not have any negative weight edges, so using Bellman-Ford would be overkill. However, it can handle negative weights if they were present.\n\nNow, let's solve the original problem using BFS:\n\n### Original Problem: Shortest Path from Node 3 to Node 0\n\nGiven:\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n- Edges: [[0, 4], [1, 10], [1, 13], [1, 14], [2, 11], [3, 13], [4, 6], [4, 12], [4, 9], [5, 11], [7, 14], [8, 9], [9, 11], [9, 14]]\n- Start node: 3\n- Destination: 0\n\nUsing BFS, we can trace the shortest path from node 3 to node 0:\n\n1. From node 3, we can directly move to node 13.\n2. From node 13, we can move to node 4.\n3. From node 4, we can move to node 9.\n4. From node 9, we can move to node 11.\n5.
