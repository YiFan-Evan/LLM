Let's first understand how to approach such problems by looking at some related examples.\n\n### Related Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 5\n\n**Solution:**\nWe can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm for unweighted graphs. In this case, BFS is simpler since all edges have the same weight.\n\nBy applying BFS, we traverse through the nodes level by level until we reach node 5.\nTherefore, the shortest path is: **0->1->2->3->4->5**\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [0, 5]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 5\n\n**Solution:**\nHere, there are multiple paths to the destination, including a direct edge from 0 to 5. Using BFS or Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm, we find the shortest path.\n\nBy applying BFS, we see that the direct edge is the shortest path.\nTherefore, the shortest path is: **0->5**\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [0, 3]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 5\n\n**Solution:**\nIn this graph, there are two possible paths from node 0 to node 5: 0->1->2->3->4->5 and 0->3->4->5. Using BFS, we determine which one is shorter.\n\nBy applying BFS, we find that both paths have the same length, but we select the path that traverses fewer edges.\nTherefore, the shortest path is: **0->3->4->5**\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 14], [1, 6], [1, 13], [1, 12], [2, 12], [3, 4], [4, 12], [5, 11], [7, 8], [7, 10], [8, 9], [10, 13], [11, 12]]}\n**Start Node:** 11\n**Destination:** 3\n\n**Solution:**\nUsing BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm, we explore the shortest path from node 11 to node 3.\n\nBy applying BFS, we find the path:\n- From node 11, go to node 12.\n- From node 12, go to node 4.\n- From node 4, go to node 3.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is: **11->12->4->3**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **11->12->4->3**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 14], [1, 6], [1, 13], [1, 12], [2, 12], [3, 4], [4, 12], [5, 11], [7, 8], [7, 10], [8, 9], [10, 13], [11, 12]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 11"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 11 to node 3 in the given graph, we can use a search algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS).
