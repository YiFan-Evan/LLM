Below are three related but not identical problems along with their descriptions and solutions.\n\n### Problem 1: Shortest Path from Node 0 to Node 14\n**Description**: Find the shortest path from node 0 to node 14.\n**Solution**: Using BFS, we can traverse the graph layer by layer. Starting at node 0, we visit all its neighbors, then their neighbors, and so on until we reach node 14. The shortest path would be 0->6->14.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path from Node 1 to Node 13\n**Description**: Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 13.\n**Solution**: Using BFS again, we start at node 1 and explore its neighbors.
