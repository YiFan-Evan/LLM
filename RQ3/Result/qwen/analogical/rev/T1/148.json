Here, we'll use BFS as it works well for unweighted graphs.\n\nUsing BFS, we explore the graph layer by layer:\n- From node 2, we go to node 4.\n- From node 4, we go to node 5.\n- From node 5, we don't have direct access to 8, so we backtrack.\n- We explore other connections and eventually reach node 10 via node 8.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 2 to node 8 is: **2->4->5->14->9->10->8**\n\nHowever, on closer inspection, we notice a more direct path:\n- From node 2, we go to node 4.\n- From node 4, we go to node 5.\n- From node 5, we can go directly to node 14.\n- From node 14, we can go directly to node 9.\n- From node 9, we can go to node 10.\n- From node 10, we can go to node 8.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is: **2->4->5->14->9->10->8**\n\nBut a more efficient path would be:\n- From node 2, we go to node 4.\n- From node 4, we go to node 5.\n- From node 5, we go to node 14.\n- From node 14, we go to node 9.\n- From node 9, we go to node 10.\n- From node 10, we go to node 8.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is: **2->4->5->14->9->10->8**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **2->4->5->14->9->10->8**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 7], [3, 12], [4, 5], [5, 14], [6, 10], [8, 10], [9, 10], [9, 11], [9, 14], [11, 13], [12, 13]]} The end node: 8 The start node: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will again consider three related problems to understand different scenarios for finding the shortest path in a graph.
