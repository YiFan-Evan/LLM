However, since we're looking for the shortest path directly to 20, we need to adjust our understanding. The correct path is actually 5->15->10->19->18->16->12->24->22->21->22, but we realize we need to go through 22 to reach 20 indirectly if it's not directly connected. Since there's no direct path given, we conclude the BFS traversal and identify that the shortest path to reach 20 from 5 involves multiple steps.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 19], [1, 12], [2, 14], [2, 23], [2, 6], [3, 15], [3, 24], [4, 18], [5, 15], [6, 22], [6, 19], [7, 23], [8, 13], [8, 19], [9, 17], [9, 15], [10, 11], [10, 19], [10, 18], [11, 20], [12, 16], [12, 24], [16, 18], [21, 22]]}  \n**Start Node:** 12  \n**Destination:** 16  \n\n**Solution:**  \nUsing BFS, the shortest path from node 12 to node 16 is: 12->16.
