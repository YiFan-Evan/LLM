We can use BFS since all edges have equal weight.\n\n1. Start at node 6.\n2. Visit neighbors: node 2.\n3. Since node 2 is directly connected to node 6, the shortest path is 6->2.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 5]]}\n**Start Node:** 7\n**Destination Node:** 3\n\n**Solution:** \nWe need to find the shortest path from node 7 to node 3.\n\n1. Start at node 7.\n2. Explore neighbors: None directly connected to 7.\n3. Move to next level: Visit neighbors of node 0 (since 0 is connected to 7).\n4.
