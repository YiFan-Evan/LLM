Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \n**Start Node:** 0  \n**Destination:** 4  \n\n**Solution:**\nWe can find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4 by exploring the graph using BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm. Starting from node 0, we can reach node 5 or node 2. From node 5, we can go to node 6, and from node 2, we can go to node 7. However, the shortest path to node 4 would be through node 0 -> 5 -> 6 -> 4.\n\n**Answer:** Therefore, the shortest path is: 0->5->6->4\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \n**Start Node:** 1  \n**Destination:** 7  \n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from node 1, we can reach node 4 directly. From node 4, there is no direct path to node 7. We need to explore other paths. The shortest path would be through node 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 6 -> 2 -> 7.\n\n**Answer:** Therefore, the shortest path is: 1->4->3->6->2->7\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \n**Start Node:** 2  \n**Destination:** 5  \n\n**Solution:**\nFrom node 2, we can directly reach node 7. There is no direct path from node 2 to node 5. The shortest path would be through node 2 -> 7 -> 6 -> 5.\n\n**Answer:** Therefore, the shortest path is: 2->7->6->5\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \n**Start Node:** 3  \n**Destination:** 4  \n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from node 3, we can directly reach node 4 or node 6.

From node 5, we can reach node 6, and from node 6, we can reach node 4. Alternatively, from node 0, going directly to node 2 leads to node 7, which does not help in reaching node 4. Hence, the shortest path from node 0 to node 4 is 0->5->6->4.\n\n**Answer:** Therefore, the shortest path is: 0->5->6->4\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \n**Start Node:** 1  \n**End Node:** 7  \n\n**Solution:**  \nStarting from node 1, we can go directly to node 4. From node 4, we can reach node 3 and then node 6, and from node 6, we can reach node 2, and finally node 2 leads to node 7. Therefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 7 is 1->4->3->6->2->7.\n\n**Answer:** Therefore, the shortest path is: 1->4->3->6->2->7\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \n**Start Node:** 2  \n**End Node:** 5  \n\n**Solution:**  \nStarting from node 2, we can go to node 7, then to node 6, and finally to node 5. This is the shortest path from node 2 to node 5 because there is no direct connection between node 2 and node 5.\n\n**Answer:** Therefore, the shortest path is: 2->7->6->5\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \n**Start Node:** 3  \n**End Node:** 4  \n\n**Solution:**  \nStarting from node 3, we can directly reach node 4 or node 6.
