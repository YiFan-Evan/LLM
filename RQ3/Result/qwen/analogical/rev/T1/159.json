Starting at node 5, we see that it connects directly to node 9 through the edge [5, 9]. Therefore, the shortest path is simply:\n```\n5->9\n```\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Graph:** Same as provided.\n**Start Node:** 1\n**Destination:** 13\n\n**Solution:** \nStarting at node 1, we can trace the connections:\n- Node 1 connects to node 13 directly via [1, 13].\nThus, the shortest path is:\n```\n1->13\n```\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Graph:** Same as provided.\n**Start Node:** 12\n**Destination:** 14\n\n**Solution:** \nStarting at node 12, we see that it connects directly to node 14 through the edge [12, 14].
