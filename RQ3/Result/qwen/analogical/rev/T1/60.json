First, let's define three related problems with different start and end points to demonstrate the approach.\n\n### Related Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 7\n\n**Solution:** \nWe can use BFS to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 7. Starting from node 0, we explore its neighbors (nodes 2 and 3). From there, we continue exploring until we reach node 7. The shortest path would be: 0->1->7.\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 3\n**Destination:** 6\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from node 3, we don't have any direct connection to node 6. We must go through other nodes. The shortest path involves going from node 3 to node 0 to node 2 to node 1 to node 4 to node 6. However, a shorter path exists by going directly from node 3 to node 0 to node 2 to node 1 to node 4 to node 6. But since node 3 is not directly connected to node 6, we must consider all intermediate nodes. Thus, the shortest path is: 3->0->2->1->4->6.\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 2\n**Destination:** 5\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from node 2, we can reach node 5 through node 1 and then node 4. The shortest path is: 2->1->4->5.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 5\n**Destination:** 4\n\nUsing BFS, we explore from node 5 and find that the shortest path to node 4 is via node 4 itself.
