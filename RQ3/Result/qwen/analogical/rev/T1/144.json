We can use algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS) for unweighted graphs.

From node 9, there is no direct connection to node 13. Therefore, we need to explore other paths. We can go through node 7 to reach node 11, then through node 8 to reach node 11 again, and finally through node 7 to reach node 11, which connects us to node 13 via node 11.

From node 6, we can reach node 13 via node 13. However, we need to reach node 14. We can go through node 9 from node 7, and then from node 9 to node 14.
