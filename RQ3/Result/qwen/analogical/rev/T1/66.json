Starting from node 1, we explore its neighbors: nodes 3 and 4. From node 3, we can reach node 5, and from there, we can reach node 7. Thus, the shortest path is 1->3->5->7.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 7]]}\n**Start Node**: 0\n**Destination**: 7\n\n**Solution**:\nUsing BFS again, we start at node 0 and explore its neighbors: nodes 6 and 7. Since node 7 is directly connected to node 0, the shortest path is simply 0->7.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 7]]}\n**Start Node**: 2\n**Destination**: 5\n\n**Solution**:\nStarting at node 2, we explore its neighbor node 3. From node 3, we can reach node 5. Therefore, the shortest path is 2->3->5.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 7]]}\n**Start Node**: 1\n**Destination**: 4\n\n**Solution**:\nStarting from node 1, we explore its neighbors: nodes 3 and 4.
