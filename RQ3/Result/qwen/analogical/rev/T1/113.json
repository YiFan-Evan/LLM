One common approach is Dijkstra's algorithm, which works well for graphs with non-negative edge weights. However, since our graph does not specify any weights and we are looking for the shortest path in terms of the number of edges, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is more straightforward for unweighted graphs.\n\n### Related Problems\n\n**Problem 1:**  \nThe graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 7], [2, 11], [3, 5], [3, 8], [4, 12], [5, 9], [6, 11], [6, 12], [8, 10]]}  \nStart node: 0  \nDestination: 10  \n\n**Solution:**  \nUsing BFS, we can explore the graph level by level. Starting from node 0, we visit its neighbors (nodes 3 and 4). From node 3, we visit its neighbors (nodes 5 and 8). From node 8, we visit node 10. Therefore, the path is 0->3->8->10.\n\n**Problem 2:**  \nThe graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 7], [2, 11], [3, 5], [3, 8], [4, 12], [5, 9], [6, 11], [6, 12], [8, 10]]}  \nStart node: 2  \nDestination: 12  \n\n**Solution:**  \nStarting from node 2, we visit its neighbors (nodes 7 and 11). From node 11, we visit node 6. From node 6, we visit node 12. Therefore, the path is 2->11->6->12.\n\n**Problem 3:**  \nThe graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 7], [2, 11], [3, 5], [3, 8], [4, 12], [5, 9], [6, 11], [6, 12], [8, 10]]}  \nStart node: 6  \nDestination: 8  \n\n**Solution:**  \nStarting from node 6, we visit its neighbors (nodes 11 and 12). From node 11, we visit node 2. From node 2, we visit node 7, but since there is no direct path from 7 to 8, we need to backtrack. From node 12, we visit node 4, then node 0, and finally node 3, and from node 3, we visit node 8.
