Since node 4 is connected to node 0 and node 0 is connected to node 6, but node 4 itself has a connection to node 6, we need to correct this.)\n\nCorrected Answer: Therefore, the final answer is: 2->4->6->3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 6], [1, 5], [2, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths.
