However, since all the edges in the graph are unweighted, BFS is the most appropriate choice because it guarantees finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\n### Related Problem 1:\n**Graph:** \n{'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], \n 'edges': [[0, 9], [1, 9], [1, 10], [1, 8], [2, 8], [3, 5], [4, 8], [5, 11], [5, 12], [6, 10], [7, 8], [8, 11]]}\n\n**Start Node:** 10\n\n**Destination:** 8\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe can use BFS to find the shortest path from node 10 to node 8. Starting from node 10, we explore its neighbors (node 6 and node 11). Since neither of these leads directly to 8, we move to their neighbors. Eventually, we reach node 8 through node 1, which connects both nodes. Therefore, the shortest path is 10 -> 1 -> 8.\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Graph:** \n{'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], \n 'edges': [[0, 9], [1, 9], [1, 10], [1, 8], [2, 8], [3, 5], [4, 8], [5, 11], [5, 12], [6, 10], [7, 8], [8, 11]]}\n\n**Start Node:** 1\n\n**Destination:** 11\n\n**Solution:**  \nUsing BFS again, we start at node 1 and explore its neighbors (nodes 9, 10, and 8). From there, we continue exploring until we reach node 11 through node 5. Therefore, the shortest path is 1 -> 8 -> 11.\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Graph:** \n{'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], \n 'edges': [[0, 9], [1, 9], [1, 10], [1, 8], [2, 8], [3, 5], [4, 8], [5, 11], [5, 12], [6, 10], [7, 8], [8, 11]]}\n\n**Start Node:** 2\n\n**Destination:** 5\n\n**Solution:**  \nUsing BFS, we start at node 2 and explore its neighbors (node 8). From node 8, we then explore its neighbors (nodes 1, 7, and 11). We do not find a direct connection to node 5, so we continue exploring until we reach node 5 through node 3.
