We'll use Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS) for these examples since the graph doesn't have weighted edges.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** Same as given.  \n**Start Node:** 3  \n**Destination:** 4  \n\n**Solution:**  \nWe need to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 4.\n1. Start at node 3.\n2. From node 3, we can go to node 5.\n3. From node 5, there is no direct edge to node 4, so we backtrack.\n4. Instead, we can see that going through node 2 to node 6 and then to node 1 and finally to node 4 is not the shortest.\n5. The shortest path is directly from node 3 to node 5 and then to node 4 via node 1 (though not directly).\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we realize there is no direct or indirect path from node 3 to node 4 without revisiting nodes. So, we need to identify if there's any other possible route which isn't directly connected.\n\nSince there is no direct or indirect connection, we conclude there's no valid path.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** Same as given.  \n**Start Node:** 2  \n**Destination:** 6  \n\n**Solution:**  \nWe need to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 6.\n1. Start at node 2.\n2. From node 2, we can go to node 5 or node 6 directly.\n\nThe shortest path is clearly: 2->6.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph:** Same as given.  \n**Start Node:** 0  \n**Destination:** 7  \n\n**Solution:**  \nWe need to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 7.\n1. Start at node 0.\n2. From node 0, we can go to node 1 or node 6.\n3. From node 6, we can go directly to node 7.\n\nSo, the shortest path is: 0->6->7.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** Same as given.  \n**Start Node:** 3  \n**Destination:** 1  \n\n**Solution:**  \nWe need to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 1.\n1. Start at node 3.\n2. From node 3, we can go to node 5.\n3. From node 5, there is no direct edge to node 1, so we backtrack.\n4. Instead, we can explore the connection through node 2 and node 6, but it's longer.\n5. The shortest path is directly from node 3 to node 5 and then to node 4 and then to node 1 (though not directly).\n\nUpon re-evaluating the connections, the shortest path is actually: 3->5->2->6->7->1, but since there is a direct link through the nodes, the shortest path simplifies to:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->5->1. \n\n(Note: After rechecking, it appears there's no direct or shorter path than 3->5->1. However, if the graph allows revisiting nodes, the path could be more complex.
