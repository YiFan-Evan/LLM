BFS is suitable here because it explores all nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found when all edges have the same weight.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (node 4).\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the distance from the start node to each node and the parent node for each node.\n3. Mark the start node as visited.\n4. Dequeue a node and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n5. Continue until the destination node (node 5) is dequeued.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize:**\n   - Queue: [4]\n   - Visited: {4}\n   - Parent: {4: None}\n\n2. **Dequeue node 4:**\n   - Neighbors: [5, 6, 7]\n   - Enqueue neighbors: [5, 6, 7]\n   - Update parent: {5: 4, 6: 4, 7: 4}\n\n3. **Dequeue node 5:**\n   - Reached the destination node (node 5).\n\n### Reconstructing the Path:\n- Starting from node 5, trace back using the parent dictionary:\n  - 5 -> 4\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->5"}]
