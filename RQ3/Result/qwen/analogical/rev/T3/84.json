This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest path.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path Using Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:**\nGiven a graph where edges have weights (even if they are all equal to 1), find the shortest path between two specified nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**\nDijkstra's algorithm is used when edge weights are non-negative. Since our graph is unweighted, we can treat all edges as having weight 1. Dijkstra's algorithm will still work effectively here.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path Using A* Algorithm\n**Description:**\nGiven a graph and a heuristic function estimating the cost to reach the goal from any node, find the shortest path between two specified nodes using the A* algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**\nA* is an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide the search towards the goal. For an unweighted graph, a simple heuristic like the Manhattan distance could be used, but BFS or Dijkstra\u2019s would be more straightforward and efficient.\n\n### Solving the Original Problem:\nNow, let's find the shortest path from node 3 to node 9 in the provided graph:\n\n**Graph Representation:**\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\nEdges: [[0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 10], [2, 10], [2, 12], [3, 9], [3, 12], [5, 7], [6, 7], [11, 12]]\n\n**Steps:**\n1.
