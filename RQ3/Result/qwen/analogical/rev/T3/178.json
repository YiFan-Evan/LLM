This ensures the shortest path is found based on the number of edges traversed.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path Using Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node, assuming all edge weights are equal to 1.\n**Solution Approach**: Although the graph is unweighted, we can treat all edges as having a weight of 1. Dijkstra's algorithm is efficient for this purpose because it guarantees finding the shortest path in a weighted graph without negative weights.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path Using Depth-First Search (DFS)\n**Description**: Use DFS to find a path from the start node to the destination node, and then verify if it is the shortest path.\n**Solution Approach**: DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. However, DFS does not guarantee the shortest path, so additional verification or post-processing would be needed to confirm the shortest path.\n\n### Solving the Original Problem:\nGiven the graph, start node 6, and destination node 4, we can use BFS to find the shortest path.\n\n#### BFS Implementation Steps:\n1.
