Therefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 is simply 1->3.\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Graph**: Same as given.\n**Start Node**: 4\n**Destination**: 7\n\n**Solution**:\nNode 4 connects to nodes 1 and 0, but neither of these connect directly or indirectly to node 7 without passing through other nodes. Node 7 is only connected to nodes 5 and 6. There are no direct paths from 4 to 7, so we need to find an indirect path. However, since the graph does not provide any such path, it is impossible to reach node 7 from node 4 using the given edges. Thus, the problem has no solution within the constraints of the provided graph.\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Graph**: Same as given.\n**Start Node**: 2\n**Destination**: 0\n\n**Solution**:\nNode 2 is not directly connected to any nodes that lead directly to node 0. Node 0 is connected to nodes 2, 4, and 6. To get from node 2 to node 0, we can follow the path 2->0. Therefore, the shortest path is 2->0.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph**: Same as given.\n**Start Node**: 1\n**Destination**: 0\n\n**Solution**:\nWe need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0. From the given edges, we can see that node 1 connects to node 3 and node 4. Neither of these nodes directly connects to node 0. However, node 4 connects to node 0 directly. Therefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 is via node 4.\n\nThe path would be:\n1 -> 4 -> 0\n\nThus, the final answer is:\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->4->0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 4], [0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 4], [5, 7], [6, 7]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's break down the problem by considering similar scenarios and then solve the original problem.\n\n### Related Problem 1:\n**Graph**: Same as given.\n**Start Node**: 0\n**Destination**: 2\n\n**Solution**:\nNode 0 is directly connected to node 2.
