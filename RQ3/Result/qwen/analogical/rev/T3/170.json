We can use algorithms like Dijkstra's or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path. Let's look at three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph**: \n{'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n 'edges': [[0, 20], [0, 9], [1, 7], [1, 17], [2, 23], [3, 6], [3, 10], [3, 9], [4, 13], [4, 22], [5, 22], [7, 9], [8, 15], [8, 12], [9, 18], [11, 20], [12, 20], [14, 23], [14, 22], [16, 24], [17, 19], [18, 21], [19, 22], [22, 24]]}\n\n**Start Node**: 12\n\n**Destination**: 18\n\n**Solution**: \nWe can use BFS to find the shortest path. Starting from node 12, we explore its neighbors (nodes 8 and 20). From node 20, we see that it connects to node 9, which connects to node 18. Thus, the shortest path is: 12->20->9->18.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph**: \n{'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n 'edges': [[0, 20], [0, 9], [1, 7], [1, 17], [2, 23], [3, 6], [3, 10], [3, 9], [4, 13], [4, 22], [5, 22], [7, 9], [8, 15], [8, 12], [9, 18], [11, 20], [12, 20], [14, 23], [14, 22], [16, 24], [17, 19], [18, 21], [19, 22], [22, 24]]}\n\n**Start Node**: 12\n\n**Destination**: 22\n\n**Solution**: \nStarting from node 12, we see it directly connects to node 20.
