Using Dijkstra's algorithm or breadth-first search, we can determine that the shortest path is 0 -> 3.\n\n**Answer for Problem 1:** Therefore, the final answer is: 0->3\n\n### Problem 2:\n- **Graph:** Same as the original graph.\n- **Start Node:** 1\n- **Destination:** 5\n\n**Solution:**\nWe need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5.
