Then we will solve the given problem using Dijkstra's algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs where all weights are non-negative.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 0]]}  \n**Start Node**: 0  \n**Destination**: 3  \n\n**Solution**: \nWe can visualize the graph as a cycle where each node is connected to the next node in sequence.

We can find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 by considering the direct connections or alternative paths:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4\nor\n1 -> 4\n\nSince the second path is shorter, the shortest path is:\n\n1 -> 4\n\n**Answer**: 1->4\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 0], [0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]}  \n**Start Node**: 0  \n**Destination**: 5  \n\n**Solution**: \nIn this case, we need to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 5.
