Here are three such problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 3], [2, 5], [2, 7], [3, 6], [4, 7], [5, 6]]}  \n**Start Node:** 2  \n**Destination Node:** 7  \n\n**Solution:**\n- From node 2, we can go to node 5.\n- From node 5, we can go to node 6.\n- From node 6, we can go to node 7.\n\nThus, one possible path is 2->5->6->7.
