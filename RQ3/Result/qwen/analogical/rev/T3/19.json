These problems will help us understand different aspects of finding the shortest path in a graph.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 5], [2, 7], [4, 7], [5, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 3\n**Destination:** 5\n\n**Solution:** \nIn this case, we are looking for the shortest path from node 3 to node 5. We can use Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path. By examining the graph, we can see that the shortest path is through node 2. Therefore, the path is 3->2->5.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 5], [2, 7], [4, 7], [5, 6]]}\n**Start Node:** 1\n**Destination:** 7\n\n**Solution:** \nHere, we need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 7.
