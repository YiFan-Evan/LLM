This will help us better comprehend the shortest path problem and how it can be approached.\n\n### Related Problem 1: Shortest Path in a Simple Graph\n**Problem:** Given a simple graph with nodes and edges, find the shortest path between two nodes.\n**Description:** Consider a graph with fewer nodes and edges for simplicity. For example, a graph with nodes [A, B, C] and edges [(A, B), (B, C)]. Find the shortest path from A to C.\n**Solution:** Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's Algorithm if the graph has weighted edges. In this case, BFS would suffice since all edges are unweighted and of equal length.\n\n### Related Problem 2: Shortest Path with Weights\n**Problem:** Given a graph where edges have weights, find the shortest path considering these weights.\n**Description:** Imagine a graph where each edge has a different weight representing distance or cost. For instance, a graph with nodes [X, Y, Z] and edges [(X, Y, 10), (Y, Z, 20)]. Determine the shortest path from X to Z.\n**Solution:** Use Dijkstra's Algorithm to account for the varying weights on the edges.\n\n### Related Problem 3: Shortest Path in a Directed Graph\n**Problem:** Given a directed graph, find the shortest path from one node to another.\n**Description:** Consider a graph where edges have a direction. For example, a graph with nodes [P, Q, R] and directed edges [(P, Q), (Q, R)].
