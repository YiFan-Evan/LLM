We stop here.\n\n### Reconstructing the Path:\n- Starting from node 3, trace back the path using the parent information (which is implicitly stored during BFS):\n  - Node 3 -> Node 5 (since 3 is connected to 5)\n  - Node 5 -> Node 0 (since 5 is connected to 0)\n  - Node 0 -> Node 6 (since 0 is connected to 6)\n  - Node 6 -> Node 4 (since 6 is connected to 4)\n  - Node 4 -> Node 2 (since 4 is connected to 2)\n  - Node 2 -> Node 1 (since 2 is connected to 1)\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 is: 1->2->4->6->0->5->3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2->4->6->0->5->3."}]
