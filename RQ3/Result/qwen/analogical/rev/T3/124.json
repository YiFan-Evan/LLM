This will help us understand different aspects of graph traversal and shortest path algorithms.\n\n### Problem 1: Shortest Path Between Two Nodes Using BFS\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two given nodes using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n**Solution:** BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. We can perform BFS starting from node 4 and stop when we reach node 1.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path Between Two Nodes Using Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two given nodes using Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n**Solution:** Although the graph is unweighted, Dijkstra's algorithm can still be used here. It will essentially behave like BFS since all edge weights are equal.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path Between Two Nodes Using Depth-First Search (DFS)\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two given nodes using Depth-First Search (DFS).\n**Solution:** DFS is not typically used for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it does not guarantee the shortest path. However, it can be used if combined with backtracking to find all possible paths and then selecting the shortest one.\n\nNow, let's apply BFS to the original problem:\n\nGiven the graph:\n```plaintext\nnodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\nedges = [[0, 8], [0, 10], [0, 9], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 6], [1, 11], [1, 12], [3, 6], [5, 7], [7, 8], [9, 11], [12, 13], [12, 14]]\n```\n\nStart node: 4\nDestination: 1\n\nUsing BFS:\n1.
