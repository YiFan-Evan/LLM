These problems will help us understand different aspects of finding the shortest path in a graph.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding Shortest Path Between Two Nodes Using BFS\n**Description:** Given a graph and two nodes, find the shortest path between them using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n**Solution Approach:** BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n**Example Solution:** For a hypothetical graph and nodes, BFS would explore nodes level by level until it finds the destination node.\n\n### Problem 2: Finding Shortest Path Using Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm\n**Description:** Given a weighted graph and two nodes, find the shortest path between them using Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm.\n**Solution Approach:** Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm works well for graphs with non-negative weights. It selects the next node to visit based on the lowest cumulative distance from the start node.\n**Example Solution:** For a hypothetical weighted graph, Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm would calculate the minimum cost path.\n\n### Problem 3: Finding Shortest Path Using A* Search Algorithm\n**Description:** Given a graph with heuristic information and two nodes, find the shortest path between them using the A* Search Algorithm.\n**Solution Approach:** A* combines the best features of BFS and Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm by using a priority queue and heuristic function to guide the search towards the goal.\n**Example Solution:** For a hypothetical graph with heuristic values, A* would efficiently navigate to the target by prioritizing promising paths.\n\nNow, we can address the original problem:\n\n### Original Problem: Finding Shortest Path Using BFS\nGiven the graph with nodes and edges:\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\n- Edges: [[0, 9], [0, 4], [1, 12], [1, 15], [2, 6], [3, 11], [3, 4], [4, 20], [5, 15], [5, 18], [5, 17], [6, 9], [7, 13], [7, 14], [7, 15], [8, 19], [8, 17], [8, 22], [9, 10], [16, 22], [17, 23], [18, 21], [20, 24], [22, 24]]\n\nWe need to find the shortest path from node `10` to node `18`.\n\n**Solution Approach:** Use BFS since the graph is unweighted.\n\nStarting from node `10`, BFS will explore nodes level by level:\n1.
