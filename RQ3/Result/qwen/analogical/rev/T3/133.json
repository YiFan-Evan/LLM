Node 14 connects to node 10 which connects to node 6.\n- Node 6 has no direct connection to 12.\n- The next closest node is 13 which can connect to node 8.\n- Node 8 connects to node 13.\n- Node 13 connects to node 2 which connects to node 12.\n- Therefore, one possible path is 0->14->10->6 (no direct path to 12).\n- Another possible path is 0->14->10->6->13->8->13->2->12.\n- The shortest path here would be using the edge directly to 13 and then to 2 and finally to 12.\n- Therefore, the shortest path is 0->14->13->2->12.\n\n### Problem 2\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,

12\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at node 1.\n- Node 1 connects directly to nodes 11, 13, and 14.\n- None of these nodes have a direct connection to 12.\n- Node 13 connects to node 3 which connects to node 9 and node 5.\n- Node 14 connects to node 10 which connects to node 6.\n- Node 6 has no direct connection to 12.\n- Node 13 connects to node 8.\n- Node 8 connects to node 13.\n- Node 13 connects to node 2 which connects to node 12.\n- Therefore, the shortest path is 1->13->2->12.\n\n### Problem 3\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 7], [0, 14],

directly to node 9.\n- Node 9 does not connect directly to node 12.\n- Node 9 connects to node 3 which connects to node 5 and node 9.\n- Node 3 also connects to node 13.\n- Node 13 connects to node 8.\n- Node 8 connects to node 13.\n- Node 13 connects to node 2 which connects to node 12.\n- Therefore, the shortest path is 4->9->3->13->2->12.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:
