Each problem will involve a different graph and different start and destination nodes, but we'll use similar methods to find the shortest path.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 9\n\n**Solution:** \nWe can see that this is a simple linear path where each node is directly connected to the next one. Therefore, the shortest path is simply the sequence of nodes from the start to the destination.\n**Path:** 0->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [0, 5]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 5\n\n**Solution:** \nHere, there are two possible paths from 0 to 5: the direct edge 0->5 or the longer path through the other nodes (0->1->2->3->4->5). The direct edge is clearly shorter.\n**Path:** 0->5\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9], [0, 9]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 9\n\n**Solution:** \nThis graph also has two potential paths: the sequential path (0->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9) and the direct edge (0->9). Again, the direct edge is the shortest path.\n**Path:** 0->9\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 22], [1, 14], [1, 4], [1, 2], [2, 11], [3, 13], [4, 13], [4, 21], [4, 22], [5, 11], [6, 10], [7, 16], [7, 14], [8, 16], [9, 10], [9, 17], [11, 23], [11, 24], [12, 19], [12, 21], [14, 15], [16, 17], [18, 23], [20, 21]]}\n**Start Node:** 20\n**Destination:** 9\n\nTo find the shortest path from node 20 to node 9, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or a breadth-first search (BFS).
