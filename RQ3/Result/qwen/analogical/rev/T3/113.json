the given problem, let's first look at some related but not identical problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3],

can go to node 5 or 8.\n- From node 8, we can directly go to node 10.\nSo, the shortest path is: **0->3->8->10**\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],

node 3 or 4.\n- From node 4, we can directly go to node 12.\nSo, the shortest path is: **0->4->12**\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0,

From node 3, we can go to node 5 or 8.\n- Node 5 or 8 does not lead to node 11 directly, so we have to look for another route.\n- From node 1, we can also go to node 3, and from there to node 8.\n- From node 8, we can go to node 10, but it doesn't help.\n- From node 2, we can go to node 11 directly.\nSo, the shortest path is: **1->3->8->10->2->11**\n\nNow, let's solve the original

node 7.\n- From node 4, we can go to node 12, which also doesn\u2019t help us reach node 7.\n- The only way to reach node 7 is through node 2.\n- From node 0, we cannot directly reach node 2, but we can go to node 3.\n- From node 3, we can go to node 8.\n- From node 8, we can go to node 10.\n- From node 10, we don\u2019t find any direct route to node 7, so we must backtrack.\n- From node 10, we cannot reach node 7 directly, so we must consider other paths.\n- From node 2, we can directly go to node 7.\n\nThus, the shortest path is: **0->3->8->10->2->7**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:

4, we can go to node 12, which doesn\u2019t help.\n- To reach node 2, we need to consider if there is a direct path from node 0 or node 3 to node 2.\n- Since there are no direct connections from node 0 or node 3 to node 2, we need to look at all possible paths.\n- From node 0, we can go to node 3.\n- From node 3, we can go to node 8.\n- From node 8, we can go to node 10.\n- From node 10, we can go to node 2 via node 7.\n- However, the shortest path is simply going directly from node 0 to node 2 via node 3 and then node 2.\n\nSo, the shortest path is: **0->3->2**\n\nTherefore, the final answer
