The goal is to find the shortest path considering all direct links.\n\n**Solution:** The shortest path would be X->Z->W, which uses the direct edge from Z to W.\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Graph:** Nodes = [P, Q, R, S, T], Edges = [[P, Q], [Q, R], [R, S], [S, T], [P, T]], **Start Node:** P, **Target Node:** T\n\n**Description:** In this problem, the graph includes a direct connection from the start node to the target node, alongside a longer path through intermediate nodes.\n\n**Solution:** The shortest path is P->T, utilizing the direct edge.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** Nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], Edges = [[0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 7], [2, 4], [3, 6], [3, 5], [5, 7]], **Start Node:** 1, **Target Node:** 5\n\n**Description:** This problem involves finding the shortest path in a graph with multiple nodes and edges, where the start and target nodes are not directly connected.\n\n**Solution:** To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Here, BFS is suitable because all edges have the same weight. Starting from node 1, the shortest path to node 5 goes through node 7, then to node 5.
