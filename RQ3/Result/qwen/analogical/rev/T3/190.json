It works by maintaining a priority queue of paths and always expanding the shortest path seen so far.\n**Answer Format:** 1->2->3...\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path with Negative Weights\n**Description:** Given a graph that may contain negative weight edges, find the shortest path from a start node to a target node using Bellman-Ford algorithm.\n**Solution Approach:** Use the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which can handle negative weights and detect negative cycles. It relaxes all edges V-1 times, where V is the number of vertices.\n**Answer Format:** 1->2->3...\n\n### Solving the Original Problem\nGiven the graph:\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\n- Edges: [[0, 1], [0, 5], [2, 8], [2, 13], [3, 20], [4, 14], [4, 23], [5, 7], [5, 17], [5, 24], [6, 8], [7, 16], [8, 15], [9, 11], [10, 19], [10, 22], [11, 17], [12, 22], [12, 23], [13, 23], [13, 17], [18, 20], [18, 24], [21, 24]]\n- Start node: 0\n- Destination: 2\n\nWe use BFS to find the shortest path since the graph is unweighted.\n\n#### Steps:\n1.

However, we need to revisit the exploration more carefully to ensure we haven't missed any direct or indirect paths to node 2.\n\nRevisiting the exploration more carefully:\n- We see that node 2 is directly connected to node 8, and node 8 is connected to node 15, and node 15 is connected to node 8 again, which doesn't lead us closer to node 2.\n- We need to check if there is any other way to reach node 2 directly or indirectly through the neighbors.\n\nAfter revisiting the steps, we realize that node 2 is not reachable directly or indirectly from node 0 within the constraints of the graph provided.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: There is no path from node 0 to node 2."}]
