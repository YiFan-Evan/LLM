Here are three related but not identical problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** Same as provided.\n**Start Node:** 8\n**Destination:** 12\n**Algorithm:** Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n**Solution:** BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. It explores all the vertices at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** Same as provided.\n**Start Node:** 8\n**Destination:** 12\n**Algorithm:** Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Solution:** Dijkstra's Algorithm is used for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph where all weights are non-negative. Since our graph is unweighted, we can treat all edge weights as 1.

In an unweighted graph, we can use a simple heuristic like the Manhattan distance or just the number of edges to the destination. This algorithm is generally more efficient if the heuristic is well-chosen.\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from node 8 to node 12 using BFS (since the graph is unweighted).\n\n#### BFS Solution:\n1.
