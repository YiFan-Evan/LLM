Then we'll use one of these methods to solve the given problem.\n\n### Problem 1: Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph Using BFS\n\n**Description:** \nGiven an unweighted graph represented by nodes and edges, find the shortest path from a start node to a target node using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n\n**Solution:**\nWe can use BFS because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time we reach the target node, it is via the shortest path.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph Using Dijkstra's Algorithm\n\n**Description:**\nGiven a weighted graph represented by nodes and edges where each edge has a weight, find the shortest path from a start node to a target node using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**\nDijkstra's algorithm works well for weighted graphs where the weights are non-negative. It uses a priority queue to ensure that the node with the smallest tentative distance is processed next.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path with Negative Weights Using Bellman-Ford Algorithm\n\n**Description:**\nGiven a graph that may have negative weight edges, find the shortest path from a start node to a target node using the Bellman-Ford algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**\nBellman-Ford can handle negative weights and even detect negative cycles. It relaxes all edges V-1 times (where V is the number of vertices) to find the shortest paths.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\n\nGiven:\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- Edges: [[0, 4], [0, 6], [0, 1], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [5, 7]]\n- Start Node: 5\n- Destination Node: 6\n\nSince the graph is unweighted, we can use BFS to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 6.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (5).\n2. Mark node 5 as visited.\n3. Dequeue a node, and check if it is the target node (6). If yes, reconstruct the path.\n4. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the dequeued node.\n5.
