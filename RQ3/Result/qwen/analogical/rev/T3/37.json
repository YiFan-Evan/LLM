For example, a graph with nodes [0, 1, 2, 3] and edges [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3]]. Suppose we want to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe shortest path in a linear graph is simply the direct path from the start node to the end node. Thus, the path would be: `0->1->2->3`.\n\n### Problem 2: Finding the Shortest Path in a Simple Connected Graph\n\n**Description:**\nConsider a simple connected graph with multiple nodes and edges that connect them in various ways. For example, a graph with nodes [0, 1, 2, 3] and edges [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [0, 3]]. Suppose we want to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.\n\n**Solution:**\nIn a simple connected graph, there might be multiple paths between two nodes. However, the shortest path can often be found using algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS). For our specific case, both `0->1->2->3` and `0->3` are valid, but `0->3` is shorter. Hence, the path is: `0->3`.\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path in a Complex Graph with Cycles\n\n**Description:**\nConsider a complex graph with cycles and multiple connections. For example, a graph with nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] and edges [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 1]]. Suppose we want to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.\n\n**Solution:**\nIn a complex graph with cycles, we must ensure we don't get stuck in an infinite loop while searching for the shortest path. Using BFS ensures that we explore all possible paths level by level. In this case, the shortest path is `0->1->2->3`.\n\n### Original Problem: Finding the Shortest Path in the Given Graph\n\n**Graph:** \nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nEdges: [[0, 5], [1, 2], [2, 4], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7]]\n\n**Start Node:** 4  \n**Destination:** 3  \n\nUsing BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm (since all edges have equal weight), we can determine the shortest path from node 4 to node 3. Tracing through the graph:\n\n1. From node 4, the only connected node is node 2.\n2. From node 2, the connected nodes are 3 and 4.
