Before presenting the solution to the specific problem, let's consider some related problems and their solutions.\n\n### Related Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 7], [6, 7]]}  \n**Start Node:** 6  \n**Destination:** 3  \n\n**Solution:**  \nTo find the shortest path from node 6 to node 3, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Starting from node 6, the shortest path would be:  \n6 -> 7 -> 3  \nTherefore, the shortest path is: **6->7->3**\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 7], [6, 7]]}  \n**Start Node:** 1  \n**Destination:** 5  \n\n**Solution:**  \nTo find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS. Starting from node 1, there is no direct path to node 5. The closest nodes we can reach are 3 and 7. Therefore, there is no valid path from node 1 to node 5 in this graph.  \nTherefore, the shortest path is: **No Path Exists**\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 7], [6, 7]]}  \n**Start Node:** 0  \n**Destination:** 4  \n\n**Solution:**  \nTo find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS.
