This will help us understand how changes in the graph structure can affect the shortest path between two points.\n\n### Problem 1: Original Graph\n- **Graph**: Nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; Edges = [[0, 10], [0, 12], [1, 3], [2, 9], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 7], [5, 12], [6, 12], [7, 12], [8, 11], [11, 12]]\n- **Start Node**: 1\n- **Destination Node**: 5\n\n#### Solution:\nWe need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5. By analyzing the graph, there are no direct or indirect paths from node 1 to node 5. Therefore, the shortest path does not exist in this configuration.\n\n### Problem 2: Modified Graph\n- **Graph**: Nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; Edges = [[0, 10], [0, 12], [1, 3], [2, 9], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 7], [5, 12], [6, 12], [7, 12], [8, 11], [11, 12], [1, 5]]\n- **Start Node**: 1\n- **Destination Node**: 5\n\n#### Solution:\nIn this modified graph, there is a direct edge from node 1 to node 5. Thus, the shortest path is simply the direct connection:\n1->5\n\n### Problem 3: Another Modified Graph\n- **Graph**: Nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; Edges = [[0, 10], [0, 12], [1, 3], [2, 9], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 7], [5, 12], [6, 12], [7, 12], [8, 11], [11, 12], [1, 6], [6, 12]]\n- **Start Node**: 1\n- **Destination Node**: 5\n\n#### Solution:\nIn this case, there is no direct edge from node 1 to node 5. However, there is a path through node 6 to node 12 and then to node 5:\n1->6->12->5\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nGiven the original graph and the requirement to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5, there is no direct or indirect path connecting these nodes.

These variations help illustrate different possible outcomes for finding the shortest path between two nodes.\n\n### Problem 1: Original Graph\n- **Graph**: Nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; Edges = [[0, 10], [0, 12], [1, 3], [2, 9], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 7], [5, 12], [6, 12], [7, 12], [8, 11], [11, 12]]\n- **Start Node**: 1\n- **Destination Node**: 12\n\n#### Solution:\nIn the original graph, there's no direct edge from node 1 to node 12. The shortest path involves going through other nodes. Starting from node 1, we can go to node 3, then to node 11, and finally to node 12:\n1->3->11->12\n\n### Problem 2: Modified Graph with Direct Edge\n- **Graph**: Nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; Edges = [[0, 10], [0, 12], [1, 3], [2, 9], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 7], [5, 12], [6, 12], [7, 12], [8, 11], [11, 12], [1, 12]]\n- **Start Node**: 1\n- **Destination Node**: 12\n\n#### Solution:\nIn this modified graph, there is now a direct edge from node 1 to node 12. Hence, the shortest path is the direct connection:\n1->12\n\n### Problem 3: Modified Graph with Additional Path\n- **Graph**: Nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]; Edges = [[0, 10], [0, 12], [1, 3], [2, 9], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 7], [5, 12], [6, 12], [7, 12], [8, 11], [11, 12], [1, 6], [6, 12]]\n- **Start Node**: 1\n- **Destination Node**: 12\n\n#### Solution:\nIn this version of the graph, there's still no direct edge from node 1 to node 12. The shortest path involves going through node 6 and then to node 12:\n1->6->12\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nGiven the original graph, we need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 12.
