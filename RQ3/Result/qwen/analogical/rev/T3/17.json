Here are three related problems along with their solutions:\n\n### Problem 1: Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph Using Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph using BFS.\n**Solution:** BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph Using Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n**Solution:** Dijkstra's algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of paths sorted by distance from the starting point. It repeatedly extracts the shortest path and relaxes the distances to its neighbors until it reaches the destination node.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Using Topological Sorting\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using topological sorting.\n**Solution:** Topological sorting orders the vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before v in the ordering. By processing the nodes in this order, we can compute the shortest paths efficiently.\n\nNow, let's solve the original problem using BFS since the graph is unweighted.\n\n**Original Problem:** Find the shortest path from node 3 to node 1 in the given graph.\n\nWe use BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1.
