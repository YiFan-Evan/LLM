Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 8\n\n**Solution:**\nUsing BFS (since all edges have equal weight):\n- Start at node 0.\n- Explore neighbors: 1 and 2.\n- From node 2, explore neighbors: 3 and 4.\n- From node 4, explore neighbor: 6.\n- From node 6, explore neighbor: 7.\n- From node 7, explore neighbor: 8.\n\nThus, the shortest path is: **0->2->4->6->7->8**\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** \nNodes: [0, 1,
