Therefore, the shortest path is `2->7`.\n\n### Problem 2:\n- **Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]}\n- **Start Node:** 4\n- **Target Node:** 7\n\n**Solution:** \nFrom node 4, we can go directly to node 7. Hence, the shortest path is `4->7`.\n\n### Problem 3:\n- **Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]}\n- **Start Node:** 1\n- **Target Node:** 5\n\n**Solution:** \nFrom node 1, we can directly reach node 5.
