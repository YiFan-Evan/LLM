We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) for this purpose, as it explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex.\n\n### Related Problems\n\n**Problem 1:** \nThe graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \nThe start node: 0  \nThe destination: 7  \n\n**Solution 1:**  \nUsing BFS, we start at node 0 and explore its neighbors (nodes 5 and 2). From node 2, we move to node 7. Therefore, the shortest path is 0->2->7.\n\n**Problem 2:** \nThe graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \nThe start node: 5  \nThe destination: 1  \n\n**Solution 2:**  \nUsing BFS, we start at node 5 and explore its neighbors (node 6 and node 0). From node 0, we cannot reach node 1 directly or through any other neighbor. However, from node 6, we can go back to node 3, then to node 4, and finally to node 1. Therefore, the shortest path is 5->6->3->4->1.\n\n**Problem 3:** \nThe graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \nThe start node: 2  \nThe destination: 7  \n\n**Solution 3:**  \nUsing BFS, we start at node 2 and directly move to node 7. Therefore, the shortest path is 2->7.\n\n### Original Problem Solution\n\n**Original Problem:**  \nThe graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]}  \nThe start node: 3  \nThe destination: 4  \n\n**Solution:**  \nUsing BFS, we start at node 3 and explore its neighbors (nodes 4 and 6). Since node 4 is one of the neighbors, the shortest path is 3->4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 3 to node 4 in the given graph is indeed 3->4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->4"}]
