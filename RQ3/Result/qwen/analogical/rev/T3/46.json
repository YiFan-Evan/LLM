In this case, BFS is straightforward since all edges have equal weight.\n\n1. From node 3, we can go to node 4.\n2. From node 4, we can go to node 7.\n\nSo, the shortest path is: **3->4->7**\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 7], [6, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 2  \n**Destination:** 5\n\n**Solution:** Here, the start node is 2 and the destination is 5. Since there is a direct edge between these two nodes, the shortest path is simply the direct connection.\n\nSo, the shortest path is: **2->5**\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 7], [6, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 0  \n**Destination:** 7\n\n**Solution:** To find the shortest path from node 0 to node 7, we again use BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\n1. From node 0, we can go to node 3.\n2. From node 3, we can go to node 4.\n3. From node 4, we can go to node 7.\n\nSo, the shortest path is: **0->3->4->7**\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 7], [6, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 3  \n**Destination:** 4\n\n**Solution:** To find the shortest path from node 3 to node 4, we can use BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\n1.
