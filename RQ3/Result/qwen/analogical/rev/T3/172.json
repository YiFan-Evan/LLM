It repeatedly extracts the path with the smallest distance, and relaxes all of its outgoing edges.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path Between Two Nodes Using Depth-First Search (DFS)\n**Description:** \nFind the shortest path between two nodes using DFS, exploring as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n**Solution:**\nDFS is not typically used for finding shortest paths because it doesn't guarantee the shortest path due to its nature of exhaustive exploration. However, it can be modified with backtracking to find one of the shortest paths if we record the path lengths.\n\nNow, applying the appropriate method to solve the original problem:\n\nGiven the graph and the starting node 0 and destination node 12, we can use BFS since the graph is unweighted.\n\nLet's perform BFS:\n1.

It might explore longer paths before finding a shorter one.\n\nNow, let's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 19:\n\n1. Start at node 0.\n2.
