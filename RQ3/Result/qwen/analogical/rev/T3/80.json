These problems will help illustrate the breadth-first search (BFS) technique used to find the shortest path.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]}  \n**Start Node**: 0  \n**Destination**: 4  \n\n**Solution**:  \nStarting at node 0, we can follow the path 0->1->2->3->4. This is the shortest path since it uses the fewest number of edges. Therefore, the shortest path is: `0->1->2->3->4`.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 4]]}  \n**Start Node**: 0  \n**Destination**: 4  \n\n**Solution**:  \nWe can reach node 4 by two paths: 0->1->3->4 and 0->2->3->4. Both paths have the same length, so either one can be considered correct. For simplicity, we can choose 0->1->3->4. Therefore, the shortest path is: `0->1->3->4`.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 4], [2, 4]]}  \n**Start Node**: 0  \n**Destination**: 4  \n\n**Solution**:  \nWe can reach node 4 using two paths: 0->1->3->4 and 0->2->4. The second path is shorter because it uses fewer edges. Therefore, the shortest path is: `0->2->4`.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 11], [3, 9], [3, 10], [4, 5], [4, 12], [5, 8], [5, 11], [6, 9], [7, 10], [10, 11]]}  \n**Start Node**: 1  \n**Destination**: 5  \n\n**Solution**:  \nStarting from node 1, we can explore the neighboring nodes in a BFS manner. The neighbors of node 1 are nodes 2 and 11. From node 11, we can go directly to node 5.
