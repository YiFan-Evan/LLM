Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 0]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 3\n\n**Solution:**  \nIn this problem, the graph forms a simple cycle. The shortest path from node 0 to node 3 is 0->1->2->3.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 0]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 4\n\n**Solution:**  \nIn this problem, the graph also forms a cycle. The shortest path from node 0 to node 4 is 0->1->2->3->4.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 0], [0, 3]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 4\n\n**Solution:**  \nIn this problem, the graph has an additional edge that creates a shortcut.

We need to check other paths:\n- From node 0, we can also go to node 6 and then to node 3, but there is no direct path from node 3 to node 4.\n\nThe shortest path is therefore 0->1->2->5->4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->1->2->5->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 7], [2, 5], [3, 6], [4, 5]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm or any shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 0.
