\n- From node 3, there are no direct edges.\n- We can go to node 2 (but we have already visited it).\n- The next best option is to go to node 6 through node 2.\n- From node 6, we can go to node 11 or node 7.\n- From node 7, we can go to node 12.\n- From node 12, we can go to node 0 and then to node 8.\n- From node 8, we can go to node 13.\n\nSo, one possible path is:
