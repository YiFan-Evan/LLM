Since the provided graph does not have weights on the edges, BFS is sufficient.\n\n### Problem 1: Shortest Path Between Two Nodes in a Simple Graph\n\n**Description:** \nGiven a graph with nodes and edges, find the shortest path between two specific nodes using BFS.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe can use BFS to explore all possible paths from the start node until we reach the destination node. BFS guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest path from the start node.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)\n\n**Description:** \nFind the shortest path between two nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).\n\n**Solution:**\nSince DAGs do not contain cycles, we can use a similar approach to BFS, often referred to as topological sorting. By processing nodes in topologically sorted order, we can efficiently compute the shortest paths.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph Using Dijkstra's Algorithm\n\n**Description:** \nFind the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph where each edge has a non-negative weight.\n\n**Solution:**\nUse Dijkstra's algorithm, which is an efficient way to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
