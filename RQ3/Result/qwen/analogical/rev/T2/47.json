Each problem will have the same graph structure but different start and target nodes.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 4], [3, 6], [4, 5], [4, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination Node:** 3\n\n**Solution:**\nTo find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS). In this case, since all edges have the same weight, BFS is appropriate.\n\n1. Start at node 0.\n2. From node 0, we can go to nodes 3 and 7.\n3. Since we want to reach node 3 directly, the shortest path is 0 -> 3.\n\n**Result:** Therefore, the shortest path is 0->3.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 4], [3, 6], [4, 5], [4, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 1\n**Destination Node:** 5\n\n**Solution:**\n1.
