This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it's via the shortest path from the source node.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph Using Dijkstra\u2019s Algorithm\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph where each edge has a non-negative weight.\n**Solution:** Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm is suitable here because it finds the shortest paths based on edge weights. However, since our graph is unweighted, this problem is less relevant, but still useful to understand when dealing with weighted graphs.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path Using Depth-First Search (DFS)\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes using DFS.\n**Solution:** DFS is generally not used for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs because it does not guarantee the shortest path.
