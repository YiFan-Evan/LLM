Each problem will involve finding the shortest path in a similar graph structure but with different nodes, edges, start nodes, and destinations.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 13], [0, 8], [1, 3], [1, 12], [1, 9], [2, 14], [4, 6], [5, 11], [7, 12], [7, 11], [8, 9], [9, 14], [10, 13]]}\n**Start Node:** 4\n**Destination:** 6\n\nThis problem is identical to the original one. The shortest path from node 4 to node 6 can be found by examining the direct connection or any other possible paths through intermediary nodes.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 13], [0, 8], [1, 3], [1, 12], [1, 9], [2, 14], [4, 6], [5, 11], [7, 12], [7, 11], [8, 9], [9, 14], [10, 13]]}\n**Start Node:** 5\n**Destination:** 11\n\nHere, we are looking for the shortest path from node 5 to node 11. The path might go through node 7 since there are edges connecting these nodes directly.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 13], [0, 8], [1, 3], [1, 12], [1, 9], [2, 14], [4, 6], [5, 11], [7, 12], [7, 11], [8, 9], [9, 14], [10, 13]]}\n**Start Node:** 2\n**Destination:** 14\n\nIn this case, we need to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 14.
