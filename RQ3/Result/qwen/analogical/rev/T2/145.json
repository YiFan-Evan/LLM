Start at node 8.\n2. Explore all neighbors (8 -> 9).\n3. From node 9, explore its neighbors (9 -> 11, 9 -> 10).\n4. The shortest path to node 10 is through node 9.\n\n**Answer:** 8->9->10\n\n#### Problem 2: Shortest Path with DFS\n**Description:** Find one path from node 8 to node 10 using DFS.\n**Solution:** DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Start at node 8.\n2. Explore neighbor 9.\n3. Explore neighbor 11 from 9.\n4. Backtrack and explore neighbor 10 from 9.\n\n**Answer:** 8->9->10\n\n#### Problem 3: Shortest Path with Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Find the shortest path from node 8 to node 10 using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n**Solution:** Dijkstra's algorithm is used for weighted graphs but can be applied here since all edges have equal weight.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Initialize distances and priority queue.\n2. Start at node 8 with distance 0.\n3. Relax neighbors and update distances.\n4. Continue until node 10 is reached.\n\n**Answer:** 8->9->10\n\n### Original Problem Solution\n\nNow, let's find the shortest path from node 8 to node 4 using BFS:\n\n**Steps:**\n1.
