However, the shortest path is 6->1->4.\n\n### Related Problem 2\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 5], [1, 6], [1, 4], [2, 4], [2, 7], [3, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 2  \n**Destination:** 7  \n**Solution:** The shortest path from 2 to 7 can be either 2->4->1->7 or 2->7 directly.
