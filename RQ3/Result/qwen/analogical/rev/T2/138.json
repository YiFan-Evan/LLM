In this case, we can manually trace the connections:\n- From node 4, we can go to node 11 or node 5.\n- From node 11, we can go to node 8.\n- From node 8, there are no direct paths to node 7.\n- From node 5, there are no direct paths to node 7 either.\n\nSince there is no direct or indirect path from node 4 to node 7 using the given edges, the shortest path does not exist.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 5], [0, 13], [0, 14], [1, 9], [2, 7], [2, 10], [3, 10], [4, 11], [4, 5], [6, 14], [8, 11], [9, 14], [12, 14]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 14\n\n**Solution:**\nTo find the shortest path from node 0 to node 14, we can again use BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm.
