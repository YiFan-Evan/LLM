Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 11], [1, 7], [1, 4], [1, 12], [2, 5], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 8], [6, 10], [8, 9], [9, 11], [10, 11]]}\n**Start Node:** 4\n**Destination:** 11\n\n**Solution:** \n- From node 4, we can go to node 8.\n- From node 8, we can go to node 9.\n- From node 9, we can go to node 11.\n\nThus, the shortest path is: 4->8->9->11.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 11], [1, 7], [1, 4], [1, 12], [2, 5], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 8], [6, 10], [8, 9], [9, 11], [10, 11]]}\n**Start Node:** 4\n**Destination:** 7\n\n**Solution:**\n- From node 4, we can go to node 8.\n- From node 8, there is no direct edge to node 7.\n- Instead, we must go back to node 1, which connects to node 7.\n\nThus, the shortest path is: 4->8->9->11->1->7.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 11], [1, 7], [1, 4], [1, 12], [2, 5], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 8], [6, 10], [8, 9], [9, 11], [10, 11]]}\n**Start Node:** 4\n**Destination:** 2\n\n**Solution:**\n- From node 4, we can go to node 8.\n- From node 8, there is no direct edge to node 2.\n- We must find another path through other nodes.\n\nSince there is no direct path from node 4 to node 2 without revisiting nodes already visited or going through a longer route, we conclude that the shortest path doesn't exist directly.
