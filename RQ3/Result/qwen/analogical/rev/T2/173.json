How would you modify BFS to handle this?\n**Solution**: Modify BFS by skipping any nodes that are marked as blocked during the exploration process.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph with Small Integer Weights\n**Description**: If the graph had small integer weights on the edges, how would you find the shortest path from node 14 to node 17?\n**Solution**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is similar to BFS but accounts for edge weights.\n\nNow, let's solve the original problem using BFS:\n\n1.
