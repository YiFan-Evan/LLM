Here are three related problems and their solutions:\n\n### Problem 1: Shortest Path with Simple BFS\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n**Solution:** \n- Start from the source node (4).\n- Explore all the neighboring nodes at the current level before moving on to the next level.\n- Track the path taken to reach each node.\n- Stop when the target node (5) is reached.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path with Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs.\n**Solution:** \n- Since the graph here has no weights on edges, Dijkstra's algorithm would essentially behave like BFS.\n- However, if edge weights were involved, you would use a priority queue to explore the shortest path first.\n- Track the shortest distance to each node and the corresponding path.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path with A* Algorithm\n**Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes using the A* algorithm which is more efficient for large graphs with heuristic information.\n**Solution:** \n- Use a heuristic function (e.g., Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance) to estimate the cost from any node to the target.\n- Maintain a priority queue to select the next node to expand based on the sum of the cost so far and the heuristic estimate.\n- Track the path taken to reach each node.\n- This method is generally used for larger or more complex graphs where heuristics can be applied effectively.\n\nNow, solving the actual problem with BFS since it's suitable for unweighted graphs:\n\nStarting BFS from node 4:\n1. From node 4, we have neighbors 5, 6, and 7.\n2.
