We'll describe each problem and its solution before providing the answer to the original question.\n\n### Problem 1: Shortest Path in a Simple Directed Graph\n**Graph:** \n- Nodes: [A, B, C]\n- Edges: [[A, B], [B, C], [A, C]]\n\n**Start Node:** A  \n**Destination:** C\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe shortest path from A to C is A -> C. Therefore, the answer is `A->C`.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path with Multiple Paths\n**Graph:** \n- Nodes: [X, Y, Z, W]\n- Edges: [[X, Y], [Y, Z], [X, Z], [Z, W]]\n\n**Start Node:** X  \n**Destination:** W\n\n**Solution:**  \nThere are two possible paths from X to W: X -> Z -> W and X -> Y -> Z -> W. The shortest path is X -> Z -> W. Therefore, the answer is `X->Z->W`.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path with Cycles\n**Graph:** \n- Nodes: [P, Q, R, S]\n- Edges: [[P, Q], [Q, R], [R, P], [Q, S]]\n\n**Start Node:** P  \n**Destination:** S\n\n**Solution:**  \nSince there is a cycle (P -> Q -> R -> P), we must avoid cycles to find the shortest path. The shortest path from P to S is P -> Q -> S. Therefore, the answer is `P->Q->S`.\n\n### Original Problem: Finding the Shortest Path in the Given Graph\n**Graph:** \n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n- Edges: [[0, 3], [0, 12], [0, 4], [1, 9], [2, 8], [2, 4], [2, 14], [5, 10], [5, 13], [6, 7], [7, 9], [7, 14], [9, 11], [12, 13]]\n\n**Start Node:** 3  \n**Destination:** 13\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
