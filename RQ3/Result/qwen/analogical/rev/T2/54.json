Starting from node 6, we can see that there are no direct connections to node 7. However, node 6 connects directly to node 0, which has a connection to node 7. Therefore, the shortest path is 6->0->7.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 5]]}\n**Start Node**: 3\n**Destination**: 5\n\n**Solution**:\nWe need to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 5. From node 3, there are two direct connections: one to node 4 and another to node 5. Since node 5 is directly connected to node 3, the shortest path is 3->5.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 5]]}\n**Start Node**: 1\n**Destination**: 4\n\n**Solution**:\nWe need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4. Starting from node 1, it connects directly to node 2, which then connects to node 6. However, there is no direct or indirect path from node 6 to node 4. Instead, we need to look for a path through node 3. Node 3 connects to both nodes 4 and 5. Therefore, the shortest path is 1->2->6 (though this does not lead directly to 4), so instead we must use 1->2->6->(no direct path)->3->4, which simplifies to 1->3->4.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 5]]}\n**Start Node**: 6\n**Destination**: 2\n\nFrom node 6, we can see that it connects directly to node 2.
