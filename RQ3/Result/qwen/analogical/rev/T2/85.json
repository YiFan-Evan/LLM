Starting at node 7, the path goes through node 4 and then to node 12. Therefore, the shortest path is 7->4->12.\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [1, 6], [1, 8], [1, 9], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 8], [4, 7], [5, 12], [9, 11], [10, 11]]}\n**Start Node:** 1\n**Destination:** 9\n\n**Solution:** \nStarting at node 1, the shortest path to node 9 would be through node 9 directly. So, the shortest path is 1->9.\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [1, 6], [1, 8], [1, 9], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 8], [4, 7], [5, 12], [9, 11], [10, 11]]}\n**Start Node:** 3\n**Destination:** 10\n\n**Solution:** \nThere is no direct connection between node 3 and node 10. The best path would involve going through multiple nodes such as 3->8->1->6->2->4->7->4->2->6->10. However, since this path is complex and not direct, it might not be the shortest path. In this case, there isn't a clear shortest path without further exploration, so we can conclude that there's no simple path from 3 to 10.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [1, 6], [1, 8], [1, 9], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 8], [4, 7], [5, 12], [9, 11], [10, 11]]}\n**Start Node:** 7\n**Destination:** 2\n\n**Solution:** \nStarting at node 7, the shortest path to node 2 involves going through node 4.
