However, since all the edges in the provided graph have equal weights, BFS is sufficient and more efficient for finding the shortest path.\n\n### Related Problem 1: Depth-First Search (DFS)\n**Description:** Use DFS to find any path from the start node (10) to the destination node (3). DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n**Solution:** DFS does not guarantee the shortest path, so it might not be the optimal solution for this problem. It may return a path, but it won't necessarily be the shortest one.\n\n### Related Problem 2: Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node (10) to the destination node (3). This algorithm works well even when edge weights are not uniform.\n**Solution:** Since all edge weights are equal, Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm will function similarly to BFS but with additional overhead due to priority queue operations. However, it will still correctly identify the shortest path.\n\n### Related Problem 3: Bidirectional Search\n**Description:** Perform a bidirectional search by simultaneously expanding from both the start node (10) and the destination node (3) until the paths meet in the middle.\n**Solution:** This approach can be very efficient in terms of time complexity for large graphs, but it requires maintaining two separate searches and ensuring they meet. For small graphs like this one, it might be overkill.\n\n### Solution to the Original Problem Using BFS\nWe'll use BFS to find the shortest path from node 10 to node 3:\n\n1. Start at node 10.\n2. Explore neighbors: Node 10 connects to node 12.\n3. Explore neighbors of node 12: Node 12 connects to node 11.\n4.

It doesn\u2019t guarantee the shortest path. For example, it might find a longer path that involves more steps.\n\n### Related Problem 2: Bidirectional Search\n**Description:** Perform a bidirectional search by expanding from both the start node (3) and the destination node (10) until paths meet in the middle.\n**Solution:** This method can be more efficient for larger graphs but is overkill for smaller graphs.
