However, since there are no weights mentioned here, BFS will suffice. Let's first define some related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7]]}, Start node: 0, Destination: 7\n\nSolution:\nUsing BFS, we explore the graph level by level. Starting from node 0, we have the following exploration:\n- Level 1: Nodes directly connected to 0 are 6 and 3.\n- Level 2: From node 6, no new nodes are reachable. From node 3, we reach node 7.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 0 to node 7 is: 0->3->7.\n\n### Problem 2:\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7]]}, Start node: 1, Destination: 6\n\nSolution:\nUsing BFS, we explore the graph level by level.

From node 3, we reach node 7.\n- Level 3: From node 7, no new nodes are reachable. From node 5, no new nodes are reachable. From node 2, we reach node 5 again.\n- Level 4: We check all paths and find that from node 2, we can reach node 5, but it does not help us reach node 6.\n- Level 5: Finally, from node 2, we find that there is no direct path to 6, so we backtrack to node 1 and explore other paths. There is no path from node 1 to node 6.\n\nThus, there is no path from node 1 to node 6.\n\n### Problem 3:\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7]]}, Start node: 2, Destination: 5\n\nSolution:\nUsing BFS, we explore the graph level by level. Starting from node 2, we have the following exploration:\n- Level 1: Node directly connected to 2 is 5.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 2 to node 5 is: 2->5.\n\n### Original Problem:\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7]]}, Start node: 6, Destination: 1\n\nSolution:\nUsing BFS, we explore the graph level by level.
