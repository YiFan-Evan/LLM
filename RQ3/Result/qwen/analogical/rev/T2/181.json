However, since all edges have the same weight, BFS is the most straightforward method for finding the shortest path.\n\n### Problem 1: Shortest Path Using BFS\n**Description:** Find the shortest path from node 23 to node 19 using BFS.\n**Solution:** \n1. Start at node 23.\n2. Explore its neighbors: nodes 10, 11, 13, and 19.\n3. Node 19 is directly connected to node 23, so the shortest path is 23->19.\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path Using DFS\n**Description:** Find any path from node 23 to node 19 using DFS.\n**Solution:** \n1. Start at node 23.\n2. Explore deeper paths first:\n   - Node 10 -> No direct path to 19.\n   - Node 11 -> Node 23 -> No direct path to 19.\n   - Node 13 -> Node 10 -> Node 23 -> No direct path to 19.\n3. Finally, explore node 19 directly connected to 23.\n\n### Problem 3: Shortest Path Using Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Find the shortest path from node 23 to node 19 using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n**Solution:** \n1. Initialize distances to infinity except for the start node (23) which is set to 0.\n2. Relax edges iteratively:\n   - From 23, the shortest distance to 19 is directly connected.\n3. The shortest path remains 23->19.\n\n### Final Answer\nSince all edges have the same weight, the shortest path is simply the direct connection between the nodes.
