In this case, since all edges can be assumed to have equal weight, BFS is sufficient.\n\nStarting from node 0, the path would go through nodes 0->1->2->3. Therefore, the shortest path is 0->1->2->3.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 0]]}  \n**Start Node:** 0  \n**Destination:** 5  \n\n**Solution:**  \nUsing BFS, we explore all the nodes level by level. Starting from node 0, the path goes through nodes 0->1->2->3->4->5.

The path goes through nodes 2->6->7. Thus, the shortest path is 2->6->7.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 6], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 5], [6, 7]]}  \n**Start Node:** 3  \n**Destination:** 1  \n\n**Solution:**  \nUsing BFS, we start from node 3 and explore the neighbors. The shortest path from node 3 to node 1 involves going through nodes 3->5->2->6->1.
