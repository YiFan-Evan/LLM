Therefore, the path is: 0->1->2->3->4->5->6.\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8], [1, 5], [2, 4], [3, 7]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination:** 8\n\n**Solution:** Here, we have a more complex graph with additional connections. The shortest path from node 0 to node 8 can be found by considering both the direct path (0->1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8) and the shorter path via the additional connections (0->1->5->6->7->8).
