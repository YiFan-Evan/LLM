Since node 2 does not lead directly to the destination, we choose node 7.\n- From node 7, there is no direct connection to node 5.\n- Hence, we need to consider node 2 again. From node 0, go to node 2.\n- From node 2, there is no direct connection to any other nodes except node 0.\n- From node 0, go to node 7 again.\n- From node 7, there is a connection to node 3.\n- From node 3, there is a connection to node 5.\n\nThus, the shortest path is: 0->7->3->5\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 7], [1, 6], [1, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 7]]}  \n**Start Node:** 1  \n**Destination:** 4  \n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at node 1.\n- From node 1, go to node 6 or node 3.
