Let's consider three different scenarios:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 11], [0, 10], [2, 10], [3, 13], [3, 4], [4, 10], [5, 9], [6, 14], [7, 11], [8, 13], [9, 12], [9, 14], [10, 12]]}\n**Start Node:** 0\n**Destination Node:** 4\n\n**Solution:** \nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS), we can find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4. By tracing the connections, we see the path goes through node 10. Thus, the shortest path is: 0->10->4.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph:** {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 11], [0, 10], [2, 10], [3, 13], [3, 4], [4, 10], [5, 9], [6, 14], [7, 11], [8, 13], [9, 12], [9, 14], [10, 12]]}\n**Start Node:** 2\n**Destination Node:** 9\n\n**Solution:** \nFrom node 2, the shortest path to node 9 involves going through node 10 and then node 12 before reaching node 9.
