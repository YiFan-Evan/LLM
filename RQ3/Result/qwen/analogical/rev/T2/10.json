These problems will vary slightly in terms of their graph structure, start node, and destination node, but they will all require finding the shortest path using similar methods.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]}  \n**Start Node**: 1  \n**Destination Node**: 0  \n\nThis is the exact problem we are trying to solve. We need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]}  \n**Start Node**: 1  \n**Destination Node**: 6  \n\nIn this problem, we are looking for the shortest path from node 1 to node 6.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]}  \n**Start Node**: 1  \n**Destination Node**: 7  \n\nHere, we are trying to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 7.\n\n### Solution Approach:\n\nTo find the shortest path in these problems, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS), since the graph does not have weighted edges. BFS is simpler and sufficient here because all edges can be considered to have equal weight.\n\n#### Applying BFS to Problem 1:\n\n1. Start at node 1.\n2. Explore neighbors: Nodes 6 and 7.\n3. Since neither leads directly to 0, continue exploring from 6 and 7.\n4. From node 6, explore its neighbors (if any) and so on until reaching node 0.\n\nLet's trace the BFS step-by-step:\n- Start at 1.\n- Visit neighbors: 6, 7.\n- From 6, no direct path to 0, visit next level neighbors.\n- From 7, no direct path to 0, visit next level neighbors.\n- From 1, try the other neighbor: 0.\n\nSince 0 is directly connected to 1, the shortest path is 1->0.\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is: 1->0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]} The start node: 0 The destination: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the given problem, let's first create three related but not identical problems and then apply the appropriate method to find the shortest path.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]}  \n**Start Node**: 0  \n**Destination Node**: 1  \n\nWe need to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 1.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]}  \n**Start Node**: 0  \n**Destination Node**: 2  \n\nHere, we need to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 2.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Graph**: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]}  \n**Start Node**: 0  \n**Destination Node**: 3  \n\nIn this problem, we need to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.\n\n### Solution Approach:\n\nFor these problems, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path since all edges are unweighted.\n\n#### Applying BFS to Problem 1:\n\n1.
