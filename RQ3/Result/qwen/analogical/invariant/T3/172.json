We'll start by presenting three related but not identical problems, along with their descriptions and solutions.\n\n### Problem 1: Insertion Sort with Correct Loop Invariant\n\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` of integers, implement the insertion sort algorithm. The algorithm sorts the array in non-decreasing order. Provide a loop invariant for the outer while loop that proves the partial correctness of the algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe outer while loop runs from `m = 0` to `len(arr)`. A suitable loop invariant for this loop could be:\n\n- **Loop Invariant:** `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m-1])`\n- **Explanation:** This invariant states that after each iteration of the outer loop, the elements from index 0 to `m-1` are sorted.\n\n### Problem 2: Insertion Sort with Correct Loop Invariant for Inner While Loop\n\n**Description:**\nGiven an array `arr` of integers, implement the insertion sort algorithm. The algorithm sorts the array in non-decreasing order. Provide a loop invariant for the inner while loop that proves the partial correctness of the algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe inner while loop runs from `z = i` to `0` as long as `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`. A suitable loop invariant for this loop could be:\n\n- **Loop Invariant:** `invariant_value = fun(arr[z+1]->arr[i])`\n- **Explanation:** This invariant states that after each iteration of the inner loop, the elements from index `z+1` to `i` are in their correct position relative to each other.\n\n### Problem 3: Insertion Sort with Correct Loop Invariant for Both Loops\n\n**Description:**\nGiven an array `arr` of integers, implement the insertion sort algorithm.
