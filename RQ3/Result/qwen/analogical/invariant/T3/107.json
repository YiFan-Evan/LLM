If the value does not exist in the array, return `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef find_id(arr, member_value):\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr):\n        if arr[h] == member_value:\n            return h\n        h += 1\n    return -1\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nThe loop invariant for this problem would be:\n- `member_value_index = h if arr[h] == member_value else -1`\nHowever, since we are looking for the index directly and returning it, we can simplify the invariant to:\n- `member_value_index = h if arr[h] == member_value else -1`\n\n#### Problem 2: Counting Occurrences of a Specific Value\n**Description:**\nGiven an array `arr` and a specific value `target`, count how many times this value appears in the array.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(arr, target):\n    count = 0\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr):\n        if arr[h] == target:\n            count += 1\n        h += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nThe loop invariant for this problem would be:\n- `count = sum(1 for x in arr[:h] if x == target)`\n\n#### Problem 3: Updating Values Based on Condition\n**Description:**\nGiven an array `arr` and a condition (e.g., if the index is equal to a specific ID), update the value at the current index to a new value.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef update_value(arr, id, new_value):\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr):\n        if h == id:\n            arr[h] = new_value\n        h += 1\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nThe loop invariant for this problem would be:\n- `arr_value = arr[h] if h != id else new_value`\n\n### Original Problem: Finding the Member Value at a Specific Index\n**Description:**\nGiven an array `arr` and an index `id`, return the value at the specified index.
