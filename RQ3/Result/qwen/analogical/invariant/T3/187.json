These problems will help us understand the behavior of the `selection_sort` algorithm and how it sorts an array.\n\n### Problem 1: Simple Selection Sort\n**Description:** \nImplement a simple selection sort algorithm that sorts an array in ascending order. The algorithm should iterate through the array and find the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array, then swap it with the first unsorted element.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        min_index = i\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Selection Sort with Sentinel\n**Description:** \nImplement a selection sort algorithm that uses a sentinel value to simplify the inner loop. The sentinel value is placed at the end of the array to avoid checking the length of the array in the inner loop.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef selection_sort_sentinel(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    sentinel = arr[-1]\n    for i in range(n-1):  # Exclude the last element which is the sentinel\n        min_index = i\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n    arr[-1] = sentinel  # Restore the sentinel value\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Selection Sort with Early Exit\n**Description:** \nImplement a selection sort algorithm that includes an early exit condition. If the array is already sorted before completing all iterations, the algorithm should terminate early.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef selection_sort_early_exit(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n-1):\n        min_index = i\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n        if min_index == i:  # Check if the array is already sorted\n            break\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Original Problem: Loop Invariant for Selection Sort\n**Description:**\nGiven the provided `selection_sort` function, determine the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop (while h < len(arr)).\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the provided `selection_sort` function can be described as follows:\n\n- The subarray `arr[0:i]` contains the smallest i elements from the original array, in sorted order.\n- The remaining elements in `arr[i:]` are unsorted.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be written as:\n```python\nTherefore, the final answer is: sorted_value = fun(arr[0:h] -> arr[0:h])\n```\nwhere `fun` represents the function that ensures the elements in `arr[0:h]` are the smallest h elements in sorted order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    h = len(arr)\n    while h > 0:\n        h -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[h]:\n                temp = arr[h]\n                arr[h] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems there are a few issues with the provided `selection_sort` function. Specifically, the variable names and logic are not consistent with a typical selection sort algorithm.
