These problems will help us understand different aspects of loop invariants.\n\n### Problem 1: Summing Elements of an Array\n\n**Description**: \nWrite a Python function `give_sum` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the sum of all elements in the array. \n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**:\nThe loop invariant for this problem would be `sum_value = sum(arr[:m])`. This means that at any point during the execution of the loop, the variable `sum_value` holds the sum of the elements in the array from the start up to the current index `m`.\n\n### Problem 2: Summing Elements of an Array with Conditional Check\n\n**Description**:\nWrite a Python function `conditional_sum` that takes an array `arr` and an integer `threshold` as inputs. The function should sum the elements of the array until it encounters an element greater than or equal to `threshold`, then return the sum.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef conditional_sum(arr, threshold):\n    sum_value = 0\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr) and arr[m] < threshold:\n        sum_value += arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**:\nThe loop invariant for this problem would be `sum_value = sum(arr[:m]) and arr[m] < threshold`. This means that at any point during the execution of the loop, the variable `sum_value` holds the sum of the elements in the array from the start up to the current index `m`, and the next element `arr[m]` is less than the `threshold`.\n\n### Problem 3: Summing Elements of an Array with Multiple Conditions\n\n**Description**:\nWrite a Python function `complex_sum` that takes an array `arr` and two integers `start_index` and `end_index` as inputs. The function should sum the elements of the array from `start_index` to `end_index` (inclusive).\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef complex_sum(arr, start_index, end_index):\n    sum_value = 0\n    m = start_index\n    while m <= end_index and m < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**:\nThe loop invariant for this problem would be `sum_value = sum(arr[start_index:m]) and m <= end_index + 1`. This means that at any point during the execution of the loop, the variable `sum_value` holds the sum of the elements in the array from `start_index` up to the current index `m`, and `m` is always less than or equal to `end_index + 1`.\n\n### Original Problem: Summing Elements of an Array\n\nGiven the function `give_sum`:\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**:\nThe loop invariant for this problem is `sum_value = sum(arr[:m])`.
