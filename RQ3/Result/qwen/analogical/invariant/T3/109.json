[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution. Finally, provide the answer to the original problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(arr):\n        if j == id:\n            member_value = arr[j]\n        j += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Problem 1\n**Description:**  \nYou have an array `arr` of integers, and you want to retrieve the value at a specific index `id`. If the index is valid (i.e., within the bounds of the array), you should return the value at that index; otherwise, return `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe function `give_member(arr, id)` already does this. It initializes `member_value` to `-1`, then iterates through the array using a while loop. If it finds the index `id`, it sets `member_value` to `arr[id]`. Finally, it returns `member_value`.\n\n### Problem 2\n**Description:**  \nGiven an array `arr` of integers, write a function that retrieves the value at a given index `id` but also prints the value being checked at each step of the loop. If the index is valid, print the value and return it; otherwise, just return `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef give_member_with_print(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(arr):\n        print(f\"Checking index {j}: Value is {arr[j]}\")\n        if j == id:\n            member_value = arr[j]\n        j += 1\n    return member_value\n```\n\n### Problem 3\n**Description:**  \nYou have an array `arr` of integers, and you want to retrieve the value at a specific index `id`. However, instead of returning `-1` for invalid indices, you want to raise an exception. Write a function that accomplishes this.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef give_member_with_exception(arr, id):\n    try:\n        return arr[id]\n    except IndexError:\n        raise IndexError(\"Index out of bounds\")\n```\n\n### Original Problem\nTo prove the partial correctness of the `give_member` function, we need to find a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**  \nThe loop invariant for the `give_member` function can be stated as follows:\n- Before the loop starts, `member_value` is set to `-1`.\n- During each iteration of the loop, `member_value` remains `-1` unless `j == id`, in which case `member_value` is set to `arr[j]`.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be written in the specified format as:\n- `member_value = -1 if j != id else arr[j]`\n- More formally, we can write it as:\n  - `member_value = -1 if j < id else arr[id] if j == id else member_value`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `member_value = -1 if j < id else arr[id] if j == id else member_value`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    j = len(arr)\n    while j > 0:\n        j -= 1\n        if j == id:\n            member_value = arr[j]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Related Problems\n\n### Problem 1\n**Description:**  \nYou have an array `arr` of integers, and you want to retrieve the value at a specific index `id`.
