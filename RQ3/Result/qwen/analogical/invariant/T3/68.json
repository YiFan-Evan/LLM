If `target` is not found, return `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef find_first_occurrence(arr, target):\n    index = -1\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            index = i\n            break  # Exit the loop once the target is found\n        i += 1\n    return index\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- `index_value = -1 if i < len(arr) else index_value`\n- This means that until the target is found, `index_value` remains `-1`.\n\n### Problem 2: Finding the Last Occurrence of a Target Value\n\n**Problem Description:**\nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function to find the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` is not found, return `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef find_last_occurrence(arr, target):\n    index = -1\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            index = i\n        i += 1\n    return index\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- `index_value = i if arr[i] == target else index_value`\n- This means that `index_value` is updated to `i` only when `arr[i]` equals `target`.\n\n### Problem 3: Counting Occurrences of a Target Value\n\n**Problem Description:**\nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function to count how many times `target` appears in `arr`.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef count_target_occurrences(arr, target):\n    count = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            count += 1\n        i += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[:i] if x == target)`\n- This means that `count_value` is the sum of all occurrences of `target` up to the current index `i`.\n\n### Original Problem: Finding the First Occurrence of a Target Value Without Early Exit\n\n**Problem Description:**\nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` is not found, return `-1`. The loop does not exit early once the target is found.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            id_value = i\n        i += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- `id_value = i if arr[i] == target else id_value`\n- This means that `id_value` is updated to `i` only when `arr[i]` equals `target`, and it retains the latest index where `target` was found.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n- `id_value = i if arr[i] == target else id_value`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        i -= 1\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            id_value = i\n    return id_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem of finding a loop invariant for the given function `give_id`, we'll start by presenting three related but not identical problems and their solutions.
