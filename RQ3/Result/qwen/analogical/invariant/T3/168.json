Let's break it down by considering three related problems, each focusing on a different aspect of the sorting process.\n\n### Problem 1: Identifying the Inner Loop Invariant\n**Problem Description:** \nThe inner while loop in the `insertion_sort` function shifts elements to their correct positions within a sorted subarray. We need to determine a loop invariant that holds true at the start of each iteration of this inner loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nAt the start of each iteration of the inner while loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[z-1]` is sorted, and all elements in this subarray are less than or equal to `arr[z]`.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n```plaintext\nsorted_subarray_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z-1])\n```\nWhere `fun` can be described as the condition that the subarray from index 0 to `z-1` is sorted and all elements are less than or equal to `arr[z]`.\n\n### Problem 2: Identifying the Outer Loop Invariant\n**Problem Description:** \nThe outer while loop iterates over the array, ensuring that after each iteration, the first `i` elements are sorted correctly. We need to find a loop invariant that holds true at the start of each iteration of this outer loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nAt the start of each iteration of the outer while loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` is sorted.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n```plaintext\nsorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])\n```\nWhere `fun` can be described as the condition that the subarray from index 0 to `i-1` is sorted.\n\n### Problem 3: Combining Both Invariants\n**Problem Description:** \nWe combine both invariants to ensure the correctness of the entire insertion sort algorithm. Specifically, we want to confirm that the combination of these invariants ensures that the array is sorted correctly after the completion of the loops.\n\n**Solution:**\nCombining both invariants, we can state that at the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` is sorted, and within this subarray, the elements up to `z-1` (where `z` is determined by the inner loop) are also sorted and in the correct position relative to `arr[z]`.\n\n**Combined Loop Invariant:**\n```plaintext\nsorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])\nsorted_and_shifted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z-1])\n```\nWhere `fun` can be described as the condition that the subarray from index 0 to `i-1` is sorted, and within this subarray, the elements up to `z-1` are also sorted and in the correct position relative to `arr[z]`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nGiven the above analysis, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the `insertion_sort` function can be stated as:\n\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        i -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's analyze the given `insertion_sort` function step-by-step to determine the appropriate loop invariant.\n\n### Problem 1: Analyzing the Outer Loop\n**Problem Description:**\nThe outer loop runs while `i > 0`, starting with `i = len(arr)`.
