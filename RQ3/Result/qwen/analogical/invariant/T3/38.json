Your task is to write a function `find_min` that returns the minimum value in the array. The function initializes `min_value` to the first element of the array and iterates through the array to update `min_value` whenever a smaller element is found.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    s = 0\n    while s < len(arr):\n        if arr[s] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[s]\n        s += 1\n    return min_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**  \n`min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[s-1])`\n\n### Problem 2\n**Description:**  \nYou are given an array `arr` of integers.
