The function initializes `max_value` with the first element of the array and updates it whenever a larger element is found.\n\n**Function Name:** `find_max`\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef find_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr):\n        if arr[l] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[l]\n        l += 1\n    return max_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to determine a loop invariant. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For the `while` loop, a suitable loop invariant could be:\n\n```plaintext\nmax_value = max(arr[0]->arr[l-1])\n```\nThis means that at the start of each iteration, `max_value` contains the maximum value of the elements from the beginning of the array up to (but not including) the current index `l`.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** \nNow consider a variation where instead of finding the maximum value, we are looking for the minimum value in the array `arr`. The function initializes `min_value` with the first element of the array and updates it whenever a smaller element is found.\n\n**Function Name:** `find_min`\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr):\n        if arr[l] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[l]\n        l += 1\n    return min_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nA loop invariant for this scenario would be:\n\n```plaintext\nmin_value = min(arr[0]->arr[l-1])\n```\nThis means that at the start of each iteration, `min_value` contains the minimum value of the elements from the beginning of the array up to (but not including) the current index `l`.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** \nAnother variation involves finding the sum of all elements in the array `arr` using a loop. The function initializes `sum_value` with 0 and adds each element of the array to `sum_value` as it iterates through the array.\n\n**Function Name:** `find_sum`\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef find_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[l]\n        l += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nA loop invariant for this scenario would be:\n\n```plaintext\nsum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[l-1])\n```\nThis means that at the start of each iteration, `sum_value` contains the sum of the elements from the beginning of the array up to (but not including) the current index `l`.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Description:** \nThe original problem involves finding the maximum value in an array `arr` using a loop.
