If `target` does not exist in `arr`, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `id_value = -1 if target not found else fun(arr[0]->arr[d-1])`\n- **Explanation**: Before the loop starts, `id_value` is initialized to `-1`. During each iteration, if `arr[d]` equals `target`, `id_value` is set to `d`. Therefore, after the loop, `id_value` will hold the index of the first occurrence of `target` or remain `-1` if `target` is not found.\n\n### Problem 2\n**Description**: Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, the program finds the last occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` does not exist in `arr`, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `id_value = -1 if target not found else fun(arr[d+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\n- **Explanation**: Before the loop starts, `id_value` is initialized to `-1`. During each iteration, if `arr[d]` equals `target`, `id_value` is updated to `d`. Therefore, after the loop, `id_value` will hold the index of the last occurrence of `target` or remain `-1` if `target` is not found.\n\n### Problem 3\n**Description**: Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, the program finds the smallest index of any occurrence of `target` in `arr`.
