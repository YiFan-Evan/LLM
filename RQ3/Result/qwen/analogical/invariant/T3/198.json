This can be expressed as:\n- Loop Invariant: `smallest_value = min(arr[s] -> arr[len(arr)-1])`\n\n### Problem 2: Selection Sort Partial Order Maintenance\n**Description:** Prove that after each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `s`), all elements from the start of the array up to index `s-1` are in sorted order.\n\n**Solution:** After each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `s`), all elements from the start of the array up to index `s-1` are in sorted order. This can be expressed as:\n- Loop Invariant: `sorted_value = arr[0] -> arr[s-1]`\n\n### Problem 3: Selection Sort Correctness of Final State\n**Description:** Prove that after the completion of the selection sort algorithm, the array is fully sorted.\n\n**Solution:** After the completion of the selection sort algorithm, the array is fully sorted.

Therefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop is:\n- Loop Invariant: `smallest_value = min(arr[s] -> arr[z-1])`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `smallest_value = min(arr[s] -> arr[z-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    s = len(arr)\n    while s > 0:\n        s -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[s]:\n                temp = arr[s]\n                arr[s] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems there is a misunderstanding in the provided code.
