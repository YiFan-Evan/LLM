[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

It returns the value at the index `id` in the array `arr`. If the index is out of bounds, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `member_value = arr[id] if id < len(arr) else -1`\n- **Explanation**: This invariant holds true because the loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i < len(arr)`, and if `i == id`, the value at `arr[id]` is assigned to `member_value`. If `id` is out of bounds, `member_value` remains `-1`.\n\n### Problem 2: Update the Member at a Given Index\n\n**Description**:\nThe function `update_member` takes an array `arr`, an integer `id`, and a new value `new_val`. It updates the value at the index `id` in the array `arr` to `new_val` and returns the updated array.\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `arr[i] = arr[i] if i != id else new_val`\n- **Explanation**: This invariant ensures that during each iteration of the loop, the elements before and after the index `id` remain unchanged, and the element at `id` is updated to `new_val`.\n\n### Problem 3: Count Occurrences of a Value\n\n**Description**:\nThe function `count_occurrences` takes an array `arr` and a value `val`. It counts how many times `val` appears in the array `arr` and returns this count.\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `count = sum(1 for i in range(i) if arr[i] == val)`\n- **Explanation**: This invariant holds true because the loop iterates over the array, and the count is incremented each time an element equals `val`.\n\n### Original Problem: Return the Member at a Given Index\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `member_value = arr[id] if id < i else -1`\n- **Explanation**: This invariant holds true because during each iteration `i` of the loop, the value at `arr[id]` is assigned to `member_value` if `id < i`, otherwise `member_value` remains `-1`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `member_value = arr[id] if id < i else -1`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        i -= 1\n        if i == id:\n            member_value = arr[i]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Problem 1: Find the Member at a Given Index (Backward Loop)\n\n**Description**:\nThe function `give_member` takes an array `arr` and an integer `id` as input. It returns the value at the index `id` in the array `arr` using a backward loop. If the index is out of bounds, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `member_value = arr[id] if id < len(arr) else -1`\n- **Explanation**: This invariant holds true because the loop iterates from `i = len(arr)` to `i > 0`, decrementing `i` each time. If `i == id`, the value at `arr[id]` is assigned to `member_value`. If `id` is out of bounds, `member_value` remains `-1`.\n\n### Problem 2: Find the Member at a Given Index with Initial Check\n\n**Description**:\nThe function `give_member_initial_check` takes an array `arr` and an integer `id` as input. It checks if `id` is within bounds before entering the loop. If `id` is out of bounds, it immediately returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `member_value = arr[id] if id < len(arr) else -1`\n- **Explanation**: This invariant holds true because the function first checks if `id` is within bounds. If `id` is out of bounds, it returns `-1` immediately. Otherwise, it enters the loop and assigns `arr[id]` to `member_value`.\n\n### Problem 3: Find the Member at a Given Index with Early Exit\n\n**Description**:\nThe function `give_member_early_exit` takes an array `arr` and an integer `id` as input. It uses a backward loop and exits early if `id` is found.\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `member_value = arr[id] if id < len(arr) else -1`\n- **Explanation**: This invariant holds true because the loop iterates from `i = len(arr)` to `i > 0`, decrementing `i` each time. If `i == id`, the value at `arr[id]` is assigned to `member_value`, and the loop exits early. If `id` is out of bounds, `member_value` remains `-1`.\n\n### Original Problem: Return the Member at a Given Index (Backward Loop)\n\n**Solution**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `member_value = arr[id] if id < len(arr) else -1`\n- **Explanation**: This invariant holds true because the loop iterates from `i = len(arr)` to `i > 0`, decrementing `i` each time. If `i == id`, the value at `arr[id]` is assigned to `member_value`. If `id` is out of bounds, `member_value` remains `-1`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `member_value = arr[id] if id < len(arr) else -1`"}]
