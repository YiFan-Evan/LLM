The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

The function iterates over the array and updates the maximum value accordingly.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    o = 0\n    while o < len(arr):\n        if arr[o] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[o]\n        o += 1\n    return max_value\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Summing Elements of an Array\n\n**Description**:\nThe task is to write a function named `sum_elements` that calculates the sum of all elements in an array. The function initializes a sum variable to zero and then iterates through the array, adding each element to the sum.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef sum_elements(arr):\n    total_sum = 0\n    o = 0\n    while o < len(arr):\n        total_sum += arr[o]\n        o += 1\n    return total_sum\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Counting Occurrences of a Target Value\n\n**Description**:\nThe task is to write a function named `count_occurrences` that counts how many times a specific target value appears in an array. The function initializes a counter to zero and then iterates through the array, incrementing the counter whenever it encounters the target value.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef count_occurrences(arr, target):\n    count = 0\n    o = 0\n    while o < len(arr):\n        if arr[o] == target:\n            count += 1\n        o += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Original Problem: Finding the Minimum Value\n\n**Function Name**: `find_min`\n**Purpose**: Find the minimum value in an array.\n\n**Loop Invariant**:\n```python\nTherefore, the final answer is: min_value = min(arr[:o+1])\n```\n\nThis means that at the i-th iteration of the loop, `min_value` holds the minimum value among the elements from the start of the array up to the current index `o`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[-1]\n    o = len(arr)\n    while o > 0:\n        o -= 1\n        if arr[o] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[o]\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Problem 1: Finding the Maximum Value (Reversed Loop)\n\n**Description**:\nModify the given `find_min` function to create a new function called `find_max` that finds the maximum value in an array.
