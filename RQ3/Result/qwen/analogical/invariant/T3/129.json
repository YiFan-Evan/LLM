However, the current implementation does not correctly achieve this because it iterates up to `2 * j < len(arr)` which skips the middle element when the array length is odd.\n\n**Solution**: \nTo find the middle value of an array, we need to iterate through half of the array's elements and then return the last accessed element as the middle value.\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \n```python\nTherefore, the final answer is: mid_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[j-1])\n```\n\n### Problem 2\n**Description**: \nThe given function `give_mid` aims to find the middle value of an array.

However, the current implementation has a loop condition `2 * j < len(arr)` which is incorrect and does not make sense in the context of finding the middle value.\n\n**Solution**: \nTo find the middle value of an array, we need to iterate from the end of the array towards the middle.

However, the current implementation iterates until `2 * j < len(arr)`, which is incorrect and does not help in finding the middle value.\n\n**Solution**: \nWe need to iterate from the end of the array towards the middle, updating `mid_value` accordingly.
