This loop runs as long as `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`. We want to identify a loop invariant for this loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for the inner while loop can be described as:\n\"Elements from index 0 to z are sorted in non-decreasing order.\"\n\n### Problem 2: Identifying the Loop Invariant for the Outer While Loop\n\n**Description:** \nNow consider the outer while loop in the `insertion_sort` function. This loop runs as long as `p < len(arr)`. We want to identify a loop invariant for this loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for the outer while loop can be described as:\n\"Elements from index 0 to p-1 are sorted in non-decreasing order.\"\n\n### Problem 3: Understanding the Final State After the Outer While Loop\n\n**Description:** \nAfter the outer while loop completes, we want to understand what state the array `arr` is in.\n\n**Solution:**\nAt the end of the outer while loop, the array `arr` will have the property that all elements from index 0 to len(arr)-1 are sorted in non-decreasing order. This means the entire array is sorted.\n\n### Answering the Original Problem\n\nGiven the above insights, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer while loop in the `insertion_sort` function can be written as:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"p_value = sorted_value(arr[0]->arr[p-1])\" \n\n(Note: This format is an attempt to match the requested format, but the concept of \"sorted_value\" isn't standard in programming terminology.
