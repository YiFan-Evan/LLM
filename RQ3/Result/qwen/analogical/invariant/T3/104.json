[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

However, it currently returns `-1` if the index `id` does not exist in the array. Modify the function to raise an exception when the index is out of bounds.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    if id >= len(arr) or id < 0:\n        raise IndexError(\"Index out of bounds\")\n    return arr[id]\n```\n\n#### Problem 2\n**Description**: \nThe function `give_member` is intended to return the value at a given index `id` from an array `arr`. However, it currently uses a while loop to iterate through the array. Convert the function to use a for loop instead.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    for e in range(len(arr)):\n        if e == id:\n            member_value = arr[e]\n    return member_value\n```\n\n#### Problem 3\n**Description**: \nThe function `give_member` is intended to return the value at a given index `id` from an array `arr`. However, it currently initializes `member_value` to `-1` before the loop. Modify the function to initialize `member_value` to `None` instead and return `None` if the index `id` does not exist in the array.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = None\n    for e in range(len(arr)):\n        if e == id:\n            member_value = arr[e]\n    return member_value\n```\n\n### Original Problem\n\n**Function Name**: `give_member`\n**Purpose**: The function `give_member` returns the value at a given index `id` from an array `arr`. If the index `id` is out of bounds, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Loop Invariant**:\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n```python\nTherefore, the final answer is: member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[e-1])\n```\n\nHere, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n```python\nmember_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[e-1])\n```\nThis means that `member_value` contains the value at the index `id` from the array `arr` for all indices `e` from `0` to `e-1`. If `id` is found within this range, `member_value` is set to the corresponding value; otherwise, it remains `-1` until the loop completes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    e = len(arr)\n    while e > 0:\n        e -= 1\n        if e == id:\n            member_value = arr[e]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Related Problems\n\n#### Problem 1\n**Description**: \nThe function `give_member` is intended to return the value at a given index `id` from an array `arr`.
