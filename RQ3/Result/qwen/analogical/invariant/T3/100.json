[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

It returns the value at the index `id` in the array. If the index `id` is out of bounds, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration can be expressed as:\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[id-1])` where `fun` is a function that returns `-1` if no match is found.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** \nThe function `give_member` takes an array `arr` and an integer `id`. It returns the value at the index `id` in the array. However, if the index `id` is out of bounds, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration can be expressed as:\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[id-1])` where `fun` is a function that returns `-1` if no match is found.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** \nThe function `give_member` takes an array `arr` and an integer `id`.

The function `give_member` iterates through the array `arr` until it reaches the index `id`, and assigns the value at `arr[id]` to `member_value`.
