Assume that the array contains at least one element.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    q = 0\n    while q < len(arr):\n        if arr[q] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[q]\n        q += 1\n    return min_value\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding Maximum Value in an Unsorted Array\n**Description**: \nGiven an unsorted array `arr`, write a function that returns the maximum value in the array. Assume that the array contains at least one element.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    q = 0\n    while q < len(arr):\n        if arr[q] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[q]\n        q += 1\n    return max_value\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Second Minimum Value in an Unsorted Array\n**Description**: \nGiven an unsorted array `arr`, write a function that returns the second minimum value in the array. Assume that the array contains at least two distinct elements.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_second_min(arr):\n    if arr[0] < arr[1]:\n        min_value = arr[0]\n        second_min_value = arr[1]\n    else:\n        min_value = arr[1]\n        second_min_value = arr[0]\n\n    q = 2\n    while q < len(arr):\n        if arr[q] < min_value:\n            second_min_value = min_value\n            min_value = arr[q]\n        elif arr[q] < second_min_value:\n            second_min_value = arr[q]\n        q += 1\n    return second_min_value\n```\n\n### Deriving the Loop Invariant for the Original Problem\n\nThe original problem is the `find_min` function, which finds the minimum value in an array.
