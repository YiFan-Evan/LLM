If the previous element is greater than the current element, they are swapped.\n**Solution:** After each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray from index 0 to `z` is sorted.\n\n### Problem 3: Deriving the Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop\n**Description:** We need to find a loop invariant for the inner loop that holds true before and after each iteration.\n**Solution:** A suitable loop invariant for the inner loop is that the subarray from index 0 to `z` is sorted.\n\nNow, let's derive the specific loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be stated as:\n\"Before and after each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` is sorted.\"\n\nGiven that the loop invariant needs to be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we can write the loop invariant as follows:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n```\nsorted_subarray = fun(arr[0]->arr[z])\n``` \n\nHere, `fun` can be interpreted as the operation that checks if the subarray from `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` is sorted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = len(arr)\n    while o > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        o -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's first clarify the given `insertion_sort` function and then derive the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\n### Problem 1: Understanding the Outer Loop\n**Description:** The outer loop iterates from `len(arr)` down to 1.\n**Solution:** After each iteration of the outer loop, the last `len(arr) - o` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n### Problem 2: Understanding the Inner Loop\n**Description:** The inner loop starts at the current element (`z`) and compares it with the previous element (`z-1`).
