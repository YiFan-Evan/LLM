However, there are some issues with the code as it stands, particularly with how the variables `g` and `i` are used. We need to identify the loop invariant for the inner loop.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = 0\n    while g < len(arr):\n        z = i  # This line uses an undefined variable 'i'\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        g += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Related Problems\n\n#### Problem 1\nIdentify the issue in the original code and correct it to implement the insertion sort correctly.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe issue is that the variable `i` is undefined. We should initialize `i` to `g` inside the outer loop.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for g in range(len(arr)):\n        i = g\n        while i > 0 and arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:\n            temp = arr[i]\n            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]\n            arr[i - 1] = temp\n            i -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n#### Problem 2\nProvide the loop invariant for the inner loop of the corrected insertion sort code.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n```plaintext\narr[0..i-1] is sorted and elements in arr[0..i-1] are less than or equal to arr[i]\n```\n\n**Formatted Loop Invariant:**\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as: arr[0..i-1]_value = sorted and elements in arr[0..i-1]_value <= arr[i]_value\n```\n\n#### Problem 3\nExplain why the loop invariant is true before and after each iteration of the inner loop.\n\n**Explanation:**\nBefore the inner loop starts:\n- The subarray `arr[0..i-1]` is already sorted.\n- Elements in `arr[0..i-1]` are less than or equal to `arr[i]`.\n\nDuring the loop:\n- If `arr[i-1] > arr[i]`, we swap them to maintain the sorted order.\n- After each swap, the element `arr[i]` moves one position to the left until it finds its correct place in the sorted subarray.\n\nAfter the loop ends:\n- The subarray `arr[0..i]` is sorted.\n- All elements in `arr[0..i]` are less than or equal to `arr[i+1]`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr[0..i-1]_value = sorted and elements in arr[0..i-1]_value <= arr[i]_value\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = len(arr)\n    while g > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        g -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's analyze the provided insertion sort code and create related problems to help understand the loop invariant for the inner loop. \n\n### Original Problem\nThe provided code attempts to sort an array using the insertion sort algorithm but has issues with the loop conditions and variable usage.
