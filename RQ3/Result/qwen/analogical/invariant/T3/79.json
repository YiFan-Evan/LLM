If `target` is not found, return `-1`.\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef search_for_index(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    t = 0\n    while t < len(arr):\n        if arr[t] == target:\n            id_value = t\n        t += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Analysis of the Original Problem\nThe given function `give_id` searches for the first occurrence of the `target` in the array `arr` and returns its index.

However, there is a mistake in the code where it uses `i` instead of `t` in the assignment statement. The correct code should be:\n\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        if arr[t] == target:\n            id_value = t\n    return id_value\n```\n\nNow, let's define three related but not identical problems:\n\n### Problem 1\n**Function Name:** `find_last_occurrence`\n**Description:** Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, find the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` does not exist in `arr`, return `-1`.\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef find_last_occurrence(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        if arr[t] == target:\n            id_value = t\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Problem 2\n**Function Name:** `search_from_end`\n**Description:** Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, search for the target starting from the end of `arr` and return the index of the last occurrence of `target`. If `target` is not found, return `-1`.\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef search_from_end(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        if arr[t] == target:\n            id_value = t\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Problem 3\n**Function Name:** `reverse_search`\n**Description:** Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, reverse-search through `arr` to find the index of the last occurrence of `target`. If `target` does not exist in `arr`, return `-1`.\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef reverse_search(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        if arr[t] == target:\n            id_value = t\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Analysis of the Original Problem\nThe function `give_id` searches for the last occurrence of the `target` in the array `arr` and returns its index.
