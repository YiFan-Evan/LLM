[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

This means that at the end of each iteration, `max_value` holds the maximum value found from the start of the array up to the current index `f`.\n\n### Problem 2: Sum of Elements\nConsider a function `sum_elements` that calculates the sum of all elements in an array:\n\n```python\ndef sum_elements(arr):\n    total_sum = 0\n    f = 0\n    while f < len(arr):\n        total_sum += arr[f]\n        f += 1\n    return total_sum\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- The loop invariant here would be `total_sum = sum(arr[0]->arr[f-1])`. This means that at the end of each iteration, `total_sum` contains the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to the previous index `f-1`.\n\n### Problem 3: Counting Elements Greater Than a Threshold\nConsider a function `count_above_threshold` that counts how many elements in an array are greater than a given threshold:\n\n```python\ndef count_above_threshold(arr, threshold):\n    count = 0\n    f = 0\n    while f < len(arr):\n        if arr[f] > threshold:\n            count += 1\n        f += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- The loop invariant here would be `count = count(arr[0]->arr[f-1], threshold)`. This means that at the end of each iteration, `count` holds the number of elements from the start of the array up to the previous index `f-1` that are greater than the threshold.\n\n### Original Problem: Find Minimum Value\nNow, we need to determine the loop invariant for the `find_min` function provided:\n\n```python\ndef find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    f = 0\n    while f < len(arr):\n        if arr[f] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[f]\n        f += 1\n    return min_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- The loop invariant here would be `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[f])`.
