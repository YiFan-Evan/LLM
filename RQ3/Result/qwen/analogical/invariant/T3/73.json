[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

It searches for the first occurrence of `target` in the array and returns its index. If `target` is not found, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true at the start of each iteration of the loop.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**  \n`id_value = fun(arr[id_value + 1] -> arr[n-1])`\n\nHowever, since `id_value` is only set when `arr[n] == target`, we can refine the loop invariant as:\n\n`id_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[n-1])`\n\nHere, `fun` is a placeholder function that represents the condition under which `id_value` is updated.\n\n### Problem 2: Finding the Last Occurrence of a Target Value\n\n**Description:** \nThe function `give_id` is modified to find the last occurrence of `target` in the array `arr`. If `target` appears multiple times, it returns the index of the last occurrence. If `target` is not found, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\nFor this problem, the loop invariant needs to reflect that `id_value` is updated only when `arr[n] == target`, but it should also ensure that `id_value` holds the index of the last occurrence of `target`.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**  \n`id_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[n-1])`\n\nHere, `fun` is a placeholder function that represents the condition under which `id_value` is updated to hold the last occurrence index.\n\n### Problem 3: Finding All Occurrences of a Target Value\n\n**Description:** \nThe function `give_id` is modified to find all occurrences of `target` in the array `arr` and store their indices in a list. If `target` is not found, it returns an empty list.\n\n**Solution:**\nThis problem requires storing all occurrences, so the loop invariant needs to reflect that `id_value` holds the indices of all occurrences up to the current point in the array.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**  \n`id_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[n-1])`\n\nHere, `fun` is a placeholder function that represents the condition under which `id_value` is updated to hold the list of all occurrence indices.\n\n### Original Problem: Finding the First Occurrence of a Target Value (Given Code)\n\n**Solution:**\n\nIn the given code, the loop invariant should reflect that `id_value` is updated only when `arr[n] == target` and holds the index of the first occurrence of `target` up to the current iteration.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**  \n`id_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[n-1])`\n\nHere, `fun` is a placeholder function that represents the condition under which `id_value` is updated to hold the index of the first occurrence of `target`.\n\nSince the given code uses `i` instead of `n` inside the loop, the correct loop invariant considering the actual code is:\n\n`id_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[n-1])`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n`id_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[n-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        n -= 1\n        if arr[n] == target:\n            id_value = i\n    return id_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Problem 1: Finding the Last Occurrence of a Target Value\n\n**Description:** \nThe function `give_id` takes an array `arr` and a target value `target`.
