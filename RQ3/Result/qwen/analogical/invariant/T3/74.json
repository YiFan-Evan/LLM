If the `target` is not found, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    o = 0\n    while o < len(arr):\n        if arr[o] == target:\n            id_value = o  # Correcting the incorrect use of `i` to `o`\n            break  # Adding a break statement to exit the loop once target is found\n        o += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Find the Last Occurrence of Target\n**Description:**\nThis problem is similar to the original one, but instead of finding the first occurrence of the `target`, we aim to find the last occurrence of the `target` in the array `arr`. If the `target` is not found, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    o = 0\n    while o < len(arr):\n        if arr[o] == target:\n            id_value = o\n        o += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n(Note: This solution is actually identical to the original code provided, which means it finds the first occurrence rather than the last.)\n\n### Problem 3: Find All Occurrences of Target\n**Description:**\nThis problem requires finding all indices where the `target` appears in the array `arr` and returning them as a list. If the `target` is not found, it returns an empty list.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    indices = []\n    o = 0\n    while o < len(arr):\n        if arr[o] == target:\n            indices.append(o)\n        o += 1\n    return indices\n```\n\n### Original Problem: Finding the First Occurrence of Target\n**Description:**\nThe original problem is to find the index of the first occurrence of the `target` in the array `arr`. If the `target` is not found, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of the loop in the original problem, we need a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.
