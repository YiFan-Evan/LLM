Provide a loop invariant for the outer loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[a-1])`\n- This means that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the elements from index 0 to index a-1 are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nGiven an array `arr` of integers, write a program that sorts the array in non-decreasing order using the selection sort algorithm. Provide a loop invariant for the inner loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- `minimum_value = fun(arr[a+1]->arr[z-1])`\n- This means that after the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the element at index `a` is the minimum among the elements from index `a` to index `z-1`.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nGiven an array `arr` of integers, write a program that sorts the array in non-decreasing order using the selection sort algorithm.

Provide a loop invariant for the outer loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[a+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\n- This means that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the elements from index `a+1` to the end of the array are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nGiven an array `arr` of integers, write a program that sorts the array in non-decreasing order using the selection sort algorithm. Provide a loop invariant for the inner loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- `maximum_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[a-1])`\n- This means that after the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the element at index `a` is the maximum among the elements from index 0 to index `a-1`.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nGiven an array `arr` of integers, write a program that sorts the array in non-decreasing order using the selection sort algorithm.
