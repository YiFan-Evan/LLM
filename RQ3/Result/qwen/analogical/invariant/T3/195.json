Specifically, the variable `i` is not defined within the loop, and the logic does not correctly implement selection sort. Let's correct the code first and then determine the loop invariants.\n\n### Corrected Code\nHere's the corrected version of the selection sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    p = len(arr) - 1  # Start from the last index\n    while p >= 0:\n        z = 0\n        while z < p:\n            if arr[z] > arr[p]:  # Find the maximum element in the unsorted portion\n                temp = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = arr[p]\n                arr[p] = temp\n            z += 1\n        p -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Loop Invariants\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\nThe inner loop runs from `z = 0` to `z < p`. The loop invariant for the inner loop can be described as follows:\n\n- **Invariant**: After the inner loop completes, the maximum value among `arr[0]` to `arr[p]` is moved to `arr[p]`.\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be written as:\n- `max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[p])`\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\nThe outer loop runs from `p = len(arr) - 1` down to `p = 0`. The loop invariant for the outer loop can be described as follows:\n\n- **Invariant**: After the outer loop completes the i-th iteration, the largest `i` elements are sorted in their correct positions at the end of the array.\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be written as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[len(arr)-i]->arr[len(arr)-1]`\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[p])`\n- `sorted_value = arr[len(arr)-i]->arr[len(arr)-1]`"}]
