[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

The function iterates through the array using a while loop until it finds the element at the specified index and assigns it to `member_value`. \n\n**Solution**:\nTo prove the partial correctness of this function, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. A suitable loop invariant could be:\n\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`\n- Here, `fun` represents the fact that `member_value` remains unchanged if the current index `p` does not match `id`.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: \nConsider a slightly modified version of the function where the array is expected to contain only unique values. The function should return the value at the specified index if it exists, otherwise, it should return `-1`.\n\n**Solution**:\nIn this case, we need to ensure that no duplicate indices are processed. The loop invariant can be:\n\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`\n- Here, `fun` indicates that `member_value` is set to the value at index `id` if found, otherwise it remains `-1`.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: \nNow consider a version of the function where the array can contain duplicate values, but the function should return the value at the last occurrence of the specified index.\n\n**Solution**:\nIn this scenario, the loop invariant needs to account for the possibility of multiple occurrences of the same index. The loop invariant would be:\n\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`\n- Here, `fun` represents that `member_value` is updated on every occurrence of the index `id`, ensuring the latest occurrence is stored.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Description**: \nThe original function `give_member` aims to find the value of a specific member in an array given its index. The function iterates through the array using a while loop until it finds the element at the specified index and assigns it to `member_value`.\n\n**Solution**:\nTo prove the partial correctness of this function, we need a loop invariant that reflects the state of `member_value` as the loop progresses. The appropriate loop invariant is:\n\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`\n- Here, `fun` indicates that `member_value` is set to the value at index `id` if found, otherwise it remains `-1`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    p = len(arr)\n    while p > 0:\n        p -= 1\n        if p == id:\n            member_value = arr[p]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Problem 1:\n**Description**: \nThe function `give_member` is designed to find the value of a specific member in an array given its index.
