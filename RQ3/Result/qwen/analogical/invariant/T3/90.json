[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Let's start by presenting three related but not identical problems.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Function:**  \n```python\ndef give_first(arr):\n    first_value = arr[0]\n    k = 0\n    while k < len(arr):\n        first_value = arr[k]\n        k += 1\n    return first_value\n```\n\n**Description:**  \nThis function is supposed to find the first element of the array `arr`. However, it incorrectly returns the last element instead.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe issue here is that the loop invariant is not correctly set up. The loop invariant should be `first_value = arr[0]`, which means the first element of the array is stored in `first_value`. But since the loop iterates through all elements, it ends up returning the last element. The correct loop invariant should be `first_value = arr[0]` but the loop should terminate before the end of the array.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Function:**  \n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    k = 0\n    while k < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[k]\n        k += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n**Description:**  \nThis function is supposed to calculate the sum of all elements in the array `arr`.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe loop invariant for this function should be `sum_value = sum(arr[:k])`, meaning the variable `sum_value` holds the sum of the first `k` elements of the array `arr`. This ensures that at every step of the loop, `sum_value` is the cumulative sum of the elements processed so far.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Function:**  \n```python\ndef give_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    k = 0\n    while k < len(arr):\n        if arr[k] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[k]\n        k += 1\n    return max_value\n```\n\n**Description:**  \nThis function is supposed to find the maximum value in the array `arr`.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe loop invariant for this function should be `max_value = max(arr[:k])`, meaning the variable `max_value` holds the maximum value among the first `k` elements of the array `arr`. This ensures that at every step of the loop, `max_value` is the maximum value found so far in the processed portion of the array.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Function:**  \n```python\ndef give_last(arr):\n    last_value = arr[0]\n    k = 0\n    while k < len(arr):\n        last_value = arr[k]\n        k += 1\n    return last_value\n```\n\n**Description:**  \nThis function is supposed to find the last element of the array `arr`.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe loop invariant for this function should be `last_value = arr[k-1]`, meaning the variable `last_value` holds the value of the element at position `k-1` after `k` iterations. This ensures that at every step of the loop, `last_value` is the value of the current element being processed.
