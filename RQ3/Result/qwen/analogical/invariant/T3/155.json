scenarios and then derive the loop invariant.\n\n### Problem 1: Sum of Elements in an Array\n\n**Description**: Write a Python function `give_sum` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the sum of all elements in the array.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = 0\n    while p < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n        p += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\nHere, we are iterating through the array `arr` using the index `p`, and adding each element to `sum_value`. \n\n**Loop Invariant**: \n- At the start of each iteration, `sum_value` is equal to the sum of the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[p-1]`.\n\nSo, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\n```plaintext\nsum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[p-1])\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Sum of First N Elements in an Array\n\n**Description**: Write a Python function `give_sum_n` that takes an array `arr` and an integer `n` as inputs and returns the sum of the first `n` elements in the array.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_sum_n(arr, n):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = 0\n    while p < n:\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n        p += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\nHere, we are iterating through the first `n` elements of the array `arr` using the index `p`, and adding each element to `sum_value`.\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \n- At the start of each iteration, `sum_value` is equal to the sum of the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[p-1]`.\n\nSo, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\n```plaintext\nsum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[p-1])\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Sum of Elements in a Subarray\n\n**Description**: Write a Python function `give_sum_subarray` that takes an array `arr` and two integers `start` and `end` as inputs and returns the sum of the elements in the subarray from `arr[start]` to `arr[end-1]`.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_sum_subarray(arr, start, end):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = start\n    while p < end:\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n        p += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\nHere, we are iterating through the subarray from `arr[start]` to `arr[end-1]` using the index `p`, and adding each element to `sum_value`.\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \n- At the start of each iteration, `sum_value` is equal to the sum of the elements from `arr[start]` to `arr[p-1]`.\n\nSo, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\n```plaintext\nsum_value =

all elements in the array.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = 0\n    while p < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n        p += 1\n    return

given function, let's break down the problem and analyze the loop structure.\n\n### Problem Description\nThe function `give_sum` takes an array `arr` and calculates the sum of its elements by iterating backward from the last element to the first.\n\n### Function Code\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = len(arr)\n    while p > 0:\n        p -= 1\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant Analysis\n- **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `p` is set to `len(arr)`, and `sum_value` is initialized to `0`.\n- **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the loop, `p` is decremented by `1`, and the current element `arr[p]` is added to `sum_value`.\n- **Termination**: The loop terminates when `p` becomes `0`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\nAt the start of each iteration, `sum_value` contains the sum of the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[p-1]`.\n\nSince `p` is decremented by `1` during each iteration, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n```plaintext\nsum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[p-1])\n```\n\nHowever, since `p` starts at `len(arr)` and decreases to `0`, we can rephrase the invariant in terms of the remaining elements:\n\n```plaintext\nsum_value = sum(arr[p+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])\n```\n\nThis means that at the start of each iteration, `sum_value` is equal to the sum of the elements from the current position `p` to the end of the array.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nsum_value = sum(arr[p+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])\n```"}]
