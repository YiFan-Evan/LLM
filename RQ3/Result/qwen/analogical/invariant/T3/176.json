The function iterates through the array and finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        min_idx = i\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = j\n        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \n- `min_idx_value = min(arr[i:n])`\n\n#### Problem 2: Bubble Sort\n**Description**: Implement a bubble sort algorithm on an array `arr`.

Specifically, the variables and conditions used within the loops are incorrect or misplaced, leading to confusion about the intended behavior. Let's analyze and correct the code first before deriving the loop invariant.\n\n### Corrected Code for Insertion Sort\n\nHere is the corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for q in range(1, len(arr)):  # Start from index 1 since the first element is considered sorted\n        key = arr[q]\n        z = q - 1\n        while z >= 0 and arr[z] > key:\n            arr[z + 1] = arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        arr[z + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant Analysis\n\nIn the corrected insertion sort algorithm, we have two nested loops:\n\n1. **Outer Loop**:\n   - Iterates over the array starting from index 1.\n   - `q` represents the current position being inserted into the sorted portion of the array.\n\n2. **Inner Loop**:\n   - Compares the current element `key` with the elements in the sorted portion of the array.\n   - Moves elements greater than `key` one position to the right.\n\nTo derive the loop invariant, consider the following:\n\n- After the outer loop iteration `q`, the subarray `arr[0:q]` is sorted.\n- This means that all elements in `arr[0:q]` are in their correct positions relative to each other.\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n\n- `sorted_subarray_length = q`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_subarray_length = q`"}]
