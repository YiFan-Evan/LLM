The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

The function aims to find the element at index `id` in the array `arr` and return it. If `id` is out of bounds, the function returns `-1`.\n\n**Loop Invariant for Problem 1:**\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be described as:\n`member_value = fun(arr[r] -> arr[id])`\nwhere `fun` is a function that assigns the value of `arr[r]` to `member_value` when `r` equals `id`, otherwise `member_value` remains `-1`.\n\n**Solution for Problem 1:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of the function `give_member`, we use the loop invariant `member_value = fun(arr[r] -> arr[id])`. Initially, `member_value` is set to `-1`, and as `r` increases, if `r` matches `id`, then `member_value` gets updated to `arr[r]`. Thus, when the loop terminates, `member_value` holds the value of `arr[id]` if `id` is within the bounds of `arr`, or `-1` otherwise.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 2:**  \nConsider a modified version of the function `give_member` where instead of returning `-1` if the index is out of bounds, the function raises an exception.\n\n**Loop Invariant for Problem 2:**\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be described as:\n`member_value = fun(arr[r] -> arr[id], r < len(arr))`\nwhere `fun` is a function that assigns the value of `arr[r]` to `member_value` when `r` equals `id` and `r` is within the bounds of the array, otherwise `member_value` remains undefined.\n\n**Solution for Problem 2:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of this modified function, we use the loop invariant `member_value = fun(arr[r] -> arr[id], r < len(arr))`. The function will raise an exception if `id` is out of bounds. During the loop, if `r` equals `id` and `r` is within the bounds of the array, `member_value` gets updated to `arr[r]`. If the loop terminates without raising an exception, `member_value` holds the value of `arr[id]`.\n\n---\n\n**Problem 3:**  \nConsider another variation of the function `give_member` where the function returns the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to the element at index `id`.\n\n**Loop Invariant for Problem 3:**\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be described as:\n`sum_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[r-1])`\nwhere `fun` is a function that sums the values of `arr[0]` through `arr[r-1]`.\n\n**Solution for Problem 3:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of this variant, we use the loop invariant `sum_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[r-1])`. Initially, `sum_value` is set to `0`, and as `r` increases, `sum_value` accumulates the sum of the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[r-1]`.
