If the `target` does not exist in `arr`, return `-1`.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n```python\ndef find_first_occurrence(arr, target):\n    index = -1\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            index = i\n            break\n        i += 1\n    return index\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- For the i-th iteration, the variable `index` holds the smallest index where `arr[index] == target` if such an index exists, otherwise `-1`.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant can be stated as `index_value = min_index(arr[0:i+1] -> target)`.\n\n### Problem 2: Finding the Last Occurrence of a Target Value\n\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, find the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If the `target` does not exist in `arr`, return `-1`.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n```python\ndef find_last_occurrence(arr, target):\n    index = -1\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            index = i\n        i += 1\n    return index\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- For the i-th iteration, the variable `index` holds the largest index up to `i` where `arr[index] == target` if such an index exists, otherwise `-1`.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant can be stated as `index_value = max_index(arr[0:i+1] -> target)`.\n\n### Problem 3: Finding All Indices of a Target Value\n\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, collect all indices of `target` in `arr` into a list.
