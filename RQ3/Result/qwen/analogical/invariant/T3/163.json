The function `insertion_sort` is intended to sort an array using the insertion sort algorithm. However, there are some issues with the provided code:\n\n1. The variable `i` is used without being defined.\n2. The loop invariant should be related to the state of the array after each iteration of the inner while loop.\n\nLet's consider the corrected version of the code and identify the loop invariant for the inner while loop.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Function:** `insertion_sort(arr)`\n**Issue:** The variable `i` is undefined.\n**Corrected Code:**\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for d in range(1, len(arr)):\n        i = d\n        while i > 0 and arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:\n            temp = arr[i]\n            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]\n            arr[i - 1] = temp\n            i -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n**Loop Invariant for the Inner While Loop:**\nThe inner while loop ensures that the subarray `arr[0:i+1]` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Therefore, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n- After the i-th iteration of the inner while loop, `arr[0:i+1]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Function:** `insertion_sort(arr)`\n**Issue:** The loop invariant needs to be formalized in the required format.\n**Corrected Code:**\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for d in range(1, len(arr)):\n        i = d\n        while i > 0 and arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:\n            temp = arr[i]\n            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]\n            arr[i - 1] = temp\n            i -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n**Loop Invariant for the Inner While Loop:**\nAfter the i-th iteration of the inner while loop, `arr[0:i+1]` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Therefore, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n- `arr[0:i+1]_value = sorted(arr[0:i+1])`\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Function:** `insertion_sort(arr)`\n**Issue:** The loop invariant needs to be correctly formatted and relevant to the inner while loop.\n**Corrected Code:**\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for d in range(1, len(arr)):\n        i = d\n        while i > 0 and arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:\n            temp = arr[i]\n            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]\n            arr[i - 1] = temp\n            i -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n**Loop Invariant for the Inner While Loop:**\nAfter the i-th iteration of the inner while loop, the subarray `arr[0:i+1]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
