This helps visualize how elements are being swapped during the sorting process.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef insertion_sort_with_debug(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        z = e\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            print(\"After swap:\", arr)  # Print the array after each swap\n            z -= 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Insertion Sort with Sentinel Value\n\n**Description:** Modify the insertion sort algorithm to include a sentinel value at the beginning of the array. The sentinel value is set to negative infinity to simplify boundary conditions.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef insertion_sort_with_sentinel(arr):\n    arr = [float('-inf')] + arr  # Add a sentinel value at the start\n    e = 1\n    while e < len(arr):\n        z = e\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr[1:]  # Remove the sentinel value before returning\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Insertion Sort with Early Exit\n\n**Description:** Implement insertion sort with an early exit condition. If no swaps were made during a pass through the array, the algorithm can terminate early since the array is already sorted.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef insertion_sort_early_exit(arr):\n    e = 1\n    swapped = False\n    while e < len(arr):\n        z = e\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n            swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break\n        e += 1\n        swapped = False\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Original Problem: Loop Invariant for Insertion Sort\n\nNow, let's address the original problem:\n\n**Problem Statement:** Provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the given insertion sort algorithm to prove its partial correctness.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nThe loop invariant should capture the state of the array up to the i-th element after the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])\n```\n\nThis loop invariant indicates that the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` is sorted at the i-th iteration of the outer loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the given insertion sort algorithm.

Specifically, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[e-1]` is sorted, where `e` is the index of the outer loop.\n\n### Loop Invariant Formulation:\nGiven the above analysis, the loop invariant can be formulated as follows:\n\n- For the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[e-1]` is sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[e-1])\n```\n\nThis loop invariant indicates that the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[e-1]` is sorted at the i-th iteration of the outer loop."}]
