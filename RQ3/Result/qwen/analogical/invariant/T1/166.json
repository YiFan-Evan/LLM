However, the provided code has some logical errors.

Then, we will determine the appropriate loop invariant for the inner loop.\n\n### Corrected Code:\n\nThe original code has a few issues:\n1. The variable `i` is undefined; it should be `g`.\n2. The outer loop condition `g <= len(arr) - 1` is correct, but typically it is written as `g < len(arr)` for simplicity.\n3. The inner loop should start from `z = g` instead of `z = i`.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = 1  # Start from the second element\n    while g < len(arr):\n        key = arr[g]  # Current element to be inserted\n        z = g - 1\n        while z >= 0 and arr[z] > key:\n            arr[z + 1] = arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        arr[z + 1] = key\n        g += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop\n\nThe inner loop is responsible for shifting elements to make space for the `key` element. The loop invariant for the inner loop should reflect that the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[g-1]` is sorted after each iteration of the inner loop.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** \nFor the inner loop `while z >= 0 and arr[z] > key:`:\n- The subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[g-1]` remains sorted after each iteration of the inner loop.\n\nFormally, the loop invariant can be written as:\n- Therefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g-1])`.\n\nThis means that at the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray from the beginning up to the current position `g-1` is already sorted."}]
