[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

If `target` is not found in `arr`, return `-1`.\n\n- **Example Input:** \n  - `arr = [4, 5, 6, 5, 7]`\n  - `target = 5`\n- **Example Output:**\n  - `3`\n\n**Problem 3:**\nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function `give_id` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`.

If the `target` is not found, it returns `-1`. The current implementation has an issue where the variable `id_value` is set to `i` inside the loop, but `i` is never defined within the loop. We need to replace `i` with `l` which is the loop variable.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need a loop invariant. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. Here is the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n```plaintext\nid_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1])\n```\n\nWhere `fun` is a function that returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the subarray `arr[0]->arr[l-1]`, or `-1` if `target` is not found.\n\n### Corrected Code\n\nHere is the corrected version of the code with the appropriate loop invariant:\n\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr):\n        if arr[l] == target:\n            id_value = l\n            break  # Exit the loop once the first occurrence is found\n        l += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```plaintext\nid_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    l = 0\n    while l <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[l] == target:\n            id_value = i\n        l += 1\n    return id_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Problem Description\n\n**Problem 1:**\nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function `give_id` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`.
