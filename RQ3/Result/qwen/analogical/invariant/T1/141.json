The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

The function initializes `sum_value` to 0 and iterates through the array, adding each element to `sum_value`. After the loop, the function returns `sum_value`.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    b = 0\n    while b < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[b]\n        b += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: \nWrite a function `give_sum` that calculates the sum of elements in an array `arr`. The function initializes `sum_value` to 0 and iterates through the array, adding each element to `sum_value`. However, this time, the loop condition is `b <= len(arr)` instead of `b < len(arr)`.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    b = 0\n    while b <= len(arr):\n        if b < len(arr):  # Prevent accessing out-of-bound index\n            sum_value += arr[b]\n        b += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: \nWrite a function `give_sum` that calculates the sum of elements in an array `arr`. The function initializes `sum_value` to 0 and iterates through the array, adding each element to `sum_value`. The loop should iterate over the entire array without going out of bounds.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    b = 0\n    while b < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[b]\n        b += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\nTo prove the partial correctness of the given `give_sum` function, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true at the start of each iteration of the loop. The loop invariant should reflect the relationship between the current state of `sum_value` and the elements of the array processed so far.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sum_value = sum(arr[:b])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    b = 0\n    while b <= len(arr) - 1:\n        sum_value += arr[b]\n        b += 1\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Problem 1:\n**Description**: \nWrite a function `give_sum` that calculates the sum of elements in an array `arr`.
