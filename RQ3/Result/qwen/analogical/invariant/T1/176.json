Write the loop invariant for the outer while loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant would be something like:\n- Before the q-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:q]` is sorted.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant would be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:q])`.\n\n### Problem 2:\nConsider an insertion sort algorithm where the inner loop sorts elements in descending order (i.e., `arr[z - 1] < arr[z]`). Write the loop invariant for the outer while loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant would be something like:\n- Before the q-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:q]` is sorted in descending order.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant would be: `sorted_desc_value = fun(arr[0:q])`.\n\n### Problem 3:\nConsider an insertion sort algorithm where the inner loop sorts elements based on their parity (even numbers before odd numbers). Write the loop invariant for the outer while loop.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant would be something like:\n- Before the q-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:q]` has even numbers before odd numbers and maintains relative order among even and odd numbers.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant would be: `parity_sorted_value = fun(arr[0:q])`.\n\n### Original Problem:\nIdentify the loop invariant for the given insertion sort algorithm where the inner loop starts from `z = q` and sorts elements in ascending order.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for the given insertion sort algorithm is:\n- Before the q-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:q]` is sorted in ascending order.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant would be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:q])`.\n\nSince the correct variable `i` is not defined in the original code, let's assume it should be `q` for the loop invariant.
