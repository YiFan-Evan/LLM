Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n### Problem Description:\nThe function `selection_sort` sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm. It repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted portion.\n\n### Outer Loop Analysis:\n- The outer loop runs from `f = 0` to `f = len(arr) - 1`.\n- After each iteration of the outer loop, the first `f` elements of the array are sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Inner Loop Analysis:\n- The inner loop runs from `z = f + 1` to `z = len(arr) - 1`.\n- During each iteration of the inner loop, the algorithm checks if the current element `arr[z]` is smaller than the element `arr[f]`. If so, it swaps them.\n- By the end of the inner loop, the smallest element among `arr[f]` to `arr[len(arr) - 1]` has been moved to position `f`.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: After the `f`-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `f` elements of the array are sorted in ascending order.\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: At the start of the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop, the first `f` elements of the array are sorted in ascending order, and the smallest element among `arr[f]` to `arr[z-1]` is at position `f`.\n\n### Formulating the Invariants:\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = arr[:f]`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: `min_value = min(arr[f:z])`\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = arr[:f]`\n- For the inner loop: `min_value = min(arr[f:z])`"}]
