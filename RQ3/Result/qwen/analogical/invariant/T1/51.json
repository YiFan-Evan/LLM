The function should return the number of times `value` appears in `arr`.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n```python\ndef count_specific_value(arr, value):\n    count_value = 0\n    for element in arr:\n        if element == value:\n            count_value += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Summing Specific Values in an Array\n**Description:** Write a function `sum_specific_values` that takes an array `arr` and a specific value `value`.
