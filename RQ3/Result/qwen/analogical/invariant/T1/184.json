We will use a loop invariant to prove its correctness.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nAt the start of each iteration of the outer loop (when `e` equals some value), the subarray `arr[0:e]` contains the smallest `e` elements of the array, and these elements are sorted.\n\n**Formal Loop Invariant Statement:**\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: smallest_e_values = fun(arr[0:e])\n```\n\nThis means that after each iteration of the outer loop, the first `e` elements of the array are the smallest `e` elements and are sorted.
