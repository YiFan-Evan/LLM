This variable is supposed to store the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the array `arr`. However, there's an error in the code where `i` is used instead of `p` inside the loop. Correct this code so that it correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the array `arr`.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe correct version of the code would replace `id_value = i` with `id_value = p` inside the loop.\n\n**Problem 2:**  \nConsider a variation of the given code where the loop continues to search for all occurrences of `target` in the array `arr`, storing the indices in a list. Modify the given code accordingly.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe modified code would initialize an empty list `indices` and append `p` to this list whenever `arr[p] == target`.\n\n**Problem 3:**  \nAnother variation of the given code aims to find the last occurrence of `target` in the array `arr`. Modify the given code to achieve this goal.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe modified code would initialize `id_value` to `-1` and update it to `p` only when `arr[p] == target`, ensuring the last occurrence is captured.\n\n### Original Problem Solution\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the given code, we need to determine a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**  \nBefore the loop starts, `id_value` is set to `-1`, indicating no match found yet. During each iteration of the loop, `id_value` is updated only if `arr[p] == target`. Therefore, after the loop ends, `id_value` will either be the index of the first occurrence of `target` or `-1` if no such element exists.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n- `id_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[p-1])` where `fun` is a function that returns `-1` if no match is found up to index `p-1`, or the index of the first match up to index `p-1`.\n\nReplacing `i` with `p` in the original code and considering the loop invariant, we have:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `id_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    p = 0\n    while p <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[p] == target:\n            id_value = i\n        p += 1\n    return id_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Related Problems and Solutions\n\n**Problem 1:**  \nThe given code has a variable `id_value` initialized to `-1`.
