[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

It initializes `member_value` to `-1`. It then iterates through the array using a while loop until `b` (the index) is less than the length of the array. Inside the loop, it checks if `b` is equal to `id`. If true, it assigns the value at index `b` in `arr` to `member_value`. After the loop completes, it returns `member_value`.\n\n**Solution**:\nTo prove the partial correctness of this function, we can use the loop invariant: `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[b-1])`.\n\n### Problem 2: Finding the Value at a Specific Index with Early Exit\n\n**Description**:\nThe function `find_member` takes an array `arr` and an integer `id` as input. It initializes `member_value` to `-1`. It iterates through the array using a while loop until `b` (the index) is less than the length of the array. Inside the loop, it checks if `b` is equal to `id`. If true, it assigns the value at index `b` in `arr` to `member_value` and breaks out of the loop.

It initializes `member_value` to `None`. It iterates through the array using a while loop until `b` (the index) is less than the length of the array.
