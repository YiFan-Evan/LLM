[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

However, it currently does not handle cases where `id` is out of bounds. Modify the function so that it returns `-1` if `id` is out of bounds.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    if id >= len(arr) or id < 0:\n        return -1\n    member_value = -1\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr):\n        if m == id:\n            member_value = arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return member_value\n```\n\n#### Problem 2\n**Description**: \nThe function `give_member` iterates through the array `arr` to find the value at a specific index `id`.

However, it currently does not handle the case where `id` is negative. Modify the function to return `-1` if `id` is negative.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    if id < 0 or id >= len(arr):\n        return -1\n    member_value = -1\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr):\n        if m == id:\n            member_value = arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return member_value\n```\n\n### Original Problem Solution\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the original function `give_member`, we need to find a loop invariant for the `while` loop.\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \nAt the start of each iteration of the loop, `member_value` contains the value of the element at index `id` if `m` has been equal to `id` before, otherwise `member_value` remains `-1`.\n\nFormally, we can write the loop invariant as:\n\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m-1])`\n- `member_value = fun(-1)` if `m` has not yet reached `id`.\n\nSince the loop invariant needs to be expressed in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can rephrase it as:\n\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m-1])`\n- `member_value = fun(-1)` if `m < id`.\n\nHowever, since we need to stick strictly to the required format, we can simplify it to:\n\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m-1])`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m-1])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    m = 0\n    while m <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if m == id:\n            member_value = arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Related Problems\n\n#### Problem 1\n**Description**: \nThe function `give_member` is designed to find the value of an element at a specific index `id` in the array `arr`.
