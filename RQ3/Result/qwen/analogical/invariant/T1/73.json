It searches through the array to find the index of the first occurrence of `target`. If the target is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\narr = [4, 7, 7, 2]\ntarget = 7\n# Expected output: 1\n```\n\n**Solution:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of this function, we can use the loop invariant `id_value = -1 if target not in arr[:n] else min(i for i, x in enumerate(arr[:n]) if x == target)`.\n\n### Problem 2: Finding the Last Occurrence of a Target Value\n\n**Description:**\nThe function `give_id` is modified to find the last occurrence of the target value in the array. If the target is found, it returns the index of the last occurrence; otherwise, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\narr = [4, 7, 7, 2]\ntarget = 7\n# Expected output: 2\n```\n\n**Solution:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of this function, we can use the loop invariant `id_value = -1 if target not in arr[:n] else max(i for i, x in enumerate(arr[:n]) if x == target)`.\n\n### Problem 3: Finding All Indices of a Target Value\n\n**Description:**\nThe function `give_id` is modified to store all indices of the target value in a list. If the target is found, it appends the index to the list; otherwise, it returns an empty list.\n\n**Example:**\n```python\narr = [4, 7, 7, 2]\ntarget = 7\n# Expected output: [1, 2]\n```\n\n**Solution:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of this function, we can use the loop invariant `indices = [] if target not in arr[:n] else [i for i, x in enumerate(arr[:n]) if x == target]`.\n\n### Original Problem: Finding the First Occurrence of a Target Value\n\n**Solution:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of the original function `give_id`, which finds the first occurrence of the target value, we use the loop invariant:\n\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: id_value = -1 if target not in arr[:n] else min(i for i, x in enumerate(arr[:n]) if x == target)\n``` \n\nThis loop invariant states that at the i-th iteration, `id_value` equals `-1` if the target value has not been found in the subarray `arr[:n]`, or it equals the minimum index where the target value appears in the subarray `arr[:n]`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    n = 0\n    while n <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[n] == target:\n            id_value = i\n        n += 1\n    return id_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Related Problems\n\n#### Problem 1: Finding the First Occurrence of a Target Value\n\n**Description:** \nThe function `give_id` takes an array `arr` and a target value `target`.

In this case, the loop invariant should reflect that `id_value` is set to the current index `n` if the target is found at that index, and remains `-1` otherwise.\n\nHowever, there is a mistake in the original code where `id_value` is being set to `i` instead of `n`. To correct this, we should use `n` instead of `i` in the loop invariant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nid_value = -1 if target not in arr[:n] else n\n``` \n\nThis loop invariant states that at the i-th iteration, `id_value` is `-1` if the target value has not been found in the subarray `arr[:n]`, or it is equal to the current index `n` if the target value is found at that index."}]
