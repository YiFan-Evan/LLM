These problems will help us understand the structure and behavior of loops in similar contexts.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding the Index of a Target Value in an Array\n\n**Description**: \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function `find_index` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` does not exist in `arr`, return `-1`.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_index(arr, target):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            return i\n        i += 1\n    return -1\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \nThe loop invariant for this problem would be: `index_value = fun(arr[0:i])`. This means that up to the current index `i`, `index_value` holds the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr[0:i]`.\n\n### Problem 2: Summing Elements in an Array Until a Condition is Met\n\n**Description**: \nGiven an array `arr` and a condition `cond`, write a function `sum_until_cond` that sums elements of `arr` until the sum meets or exceeds `cond`. Return the sum.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef sum_until_cond(arr, cond):\n    s = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr) and s < cond:\n        s += arr[i]\n        i += 1\n    return s\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \nThe loop invariant for this problem would be: `sum_value = fun(arr[0:i])`. This means that up to the current index `i`, `sum_value` holds the sum of elements from `arr[0:i]`.\n\n### Problem 3: Counting Occurrences of a Target Value in an Array\n\n**Description**: \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function `count_target` that counts the number of occurrences of `target` in `arr`.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef count_target(arr, target):\n    count = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            count += 1\n        i += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \nThe loop invariant for this problem would be: `count_value = fun(arr[0:i])`. This means that up to the current index `i`, `count_value` holds the count of occurrences of `target` in `arr[0:i]`.\n\n### Original Problem: Finding the ID of a Target Value in an Array\n\n**Description**: \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function `give_id` that returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` does not exist in `arr`, return `-1`.\n\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    r = 0\n    while r < len(arr):\n        if arr[r] == target:\n            id_value = r  # Note: Here it should be `r` instead of `i`\n        r += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**:\nThe loop invariant for this problem would be: `id_value = fun(arr[0:r])`. This means that up to the current index `r`, `id_value` holds the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr[0:r]`.\n\n**Note**: There is a mistake in the original code where `id_value` is set to `i` instead of `r`.
