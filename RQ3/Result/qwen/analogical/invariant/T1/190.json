These problems will help us understand the underlying logic and how the loop invariant can be formulated.\n\n### Problem 1: Simple Selection Sort\n\n**Description**: \nImplement a simple selection sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The algorithm should find the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for k in range(n):\n        min_index = k\n        for z in range(k+1, n):\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = z\n        arr[k], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[k]\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Selection Sort with Sentinel\n\n**Description**: \nModify the selection sort algorithm to include a sentinel value at the end of the array. The sentinel value should be the maximum integer value possible, ensuring no out-of-bound errors during comparisons.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef selection_sort_with_sentinel(arr):\n    arr.append(float('inf'))  # Sentinel value\n    n = len(arr) - 1  # Exclude the sentinel\n    for k in range(n):\n        min_index = k\n        for z in range(k+1, n+1):\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = z\n        arr[k], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[k]\n    arr.pop()  # Remove the sentinel\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Selection Sort with Tracking Swaps\n\n**Description**: \nImplement a selection sort algorithm that also counts the number of swaps made during the sorting process. The function should return both the sorted array and the total number of swaps.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef selection_sort_with_swaps(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    swaps = 0\n    for k in range(n):\n        min_index = k\n        for z in range(k+1, n):\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = z\n        if min_index != k:\n            arr[k], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[k]\n            swaps += 1\n    return arr, swaps\n```\n\n### Original Problem: Selection Sort Loop Invariant\n\n**Problem Statement**: \nGiven the original selection sort implementation, provide a loop invariant for the `k`-th iteration of the outer loop.\n\n**Answer**:\nThe loop invariant for the `k`-th iteration of the outer loop is that the first `k` elements of the array are sorted and are in their correct positions relative to each other.\n\nFormally, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[:k])\n```\nwhere `fun` is a function that returns the subarray `arr[:k]` which is sorted.\n\nSince the exact form of `fun` isn't specified in the format requested, we need to rephrase this in the required format. Considering the invariant that the first `k` elements are sorted, we can state:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[:k])\n```\nHere, `fun` implicitly represents the fact that the first `k` elements are sorted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    k = 0\n    while k <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = k + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[k]:\n                temp = arr[k]\n                arr[k] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        k += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given selection sort implementation, let's analyze the code step-by-step.\n\n### Problem 1: Simple Selection Sort with Loop Invariant\n\n**Description**: \nImplement a simple selection sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
