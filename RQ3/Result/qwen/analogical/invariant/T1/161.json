Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Problem 1: Outer Loop Invariant\nThe outer loop iterates over the array from index 0 to `len(arr) - 1`. We need to find an invariant that holds true at the beginning of each iteration of this loop.\n\n**Description**: At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `b` elements of the array are sorted and in their correct positions.\n\n**Solution**: \n- At the beginning of the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `b` elements of the array are sorted.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant can be stated as: `sorted_value = arr[:b]`.\n\n### Problem 2: Inner Loop Invariant\nThe inner loop runs while `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`. This loop is responsible for placing the current element in its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.\n\n**Description**: At the start of the j-th iteration of the inner loop, the elements from index `z` to `b` are in their correct positions within the sorted subarray.\n\n**Solution**:\n- At the beginning of the j-th iteration of the inner loop, the elements from index `z` to `b` are in their correct positions within the sorted subarray.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant can be stated as: `sorted_value = arr[z:b+1]`.\n\n### Problem 3: Combined Invariant\nNow, let's combine the invariants to understand the overall behavior of the algorithm.\n\n**Description**: At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `b` elements of the array are sorted, and the inner loop ensures that the current element is placed correctly within this sorted subarray.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Combining the invariants, we get: `sorted_value = arr[:b]`.\n\n### Original Problem: Loop Invariant\nGiven the above analysis, we need to formulate the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\n\n**Answer**:\n- Therefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = arr[:b]`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = 0\n    while b <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        b += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's analyze the provided `insertion_sort` function to determine the loop invariant for the outer loop.\n\n### Problem 1: Outer Loop Invariant\nThe outer loop iterates over the array from index 0 to `len(arr) - 1`.
