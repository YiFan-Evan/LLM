These problems will help us understand the context and the behavior of the loop invariant.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Description:** Define a loop invariant for the `give_sum` function to prove that the sum of the elements processed so far is correct after each iteration of the loop.\n\n**Solution:**\n- **Loop Invariant:** `sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`\n- **Explanation:** At the start of each iteration, `sum_value` holds the sum of the elements from index `0` to `p-1`. When the loop terminates, `sum_value` contains the sum of all elements in the array `arr`.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** Modify the `give_sum` function to compute the sum of elements from a specific starting index `start_index` to the end of the array. Define a loop invariant to prove the correctness of this modified function.\n\n**Solution:**\n- **Function:** \n```python\ndef give_sum_from_start(arr, start_index):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = start_index\n    while p < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n        p += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n- **Loop Invariant:** `sum_value = sum(arr[start_index]->arr[p-1])`\n- **Explanation:** At the start of each iteration, `sum_value` holds the sum of the elements from `start_index` to `p-1`. When the loop terminates, `sum_value` contains the sum of all elements from `start_index` to the end of the array `arr`.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** Define a loop invariant for a function that computes the sum of every second element in an array, starting from a specific index `start_index`. The function should return the sum of these elements.\n\n**Solution:**\n- **Function:**\n```python\ndef give_sum_every_second(arr, start_index):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = start_index\n    while p < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n        p += 2\n    return sum_value\n```\n- **Loop Invariant:** `sum_value = sum(arr[start_index], arr[start_index+2], ..., arr[p-2])`\n- **Explanation:** At the start of each iteration, `sum_value` holds the sum of every second element starting from `start_index` up to `p-2`. When the loop terminates, `sum_value` contains the sum of every second element starting from `start_index`.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Description:** Define a loop invariant for the `give_sum` function to prove that the sum of the elements processed so far is correct after each iteration of the loop.\n\n**Solution:**\n- **Loop Invariant:** `sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`\n- **Explanation:** At the start of each iteration, `sum_value` holds the sum of the elements from index `0` to `p-1`.
