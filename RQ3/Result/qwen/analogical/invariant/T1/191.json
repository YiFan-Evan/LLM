The purpose of this algorithm is to sort an array in ascending order. \n\n**Solution:**\nTo prove the partial correctness of the Selection Sort algorithm using a loop invariant, we can state that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the smallest element among `arr[l]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]` has been placed at position `arr[l]`.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** \n`smallest_value = min(arr[l:len(arr)])`\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** \nConsider a variation where the array is sorted in descending order instead of ascending order.\n\n**Solution:**\nIn this case, the algorithm would still use the same structure but would swap elements if `arr[z] > arr[l]` instead of `arr[z] < arr[l]`.
