This means that after the i-th iteration, the smallest element in the subarray from index i to n-1 is known.\n- For the inner loop, the loop invariant could be `min_index_value = min(arr[i:j+1])`, meaning that after the j-th iteration, the smallest element in the subarray from index i to j is known.\n\n### Related Problem 2:\n**Problem Statement:** Implement a function that sorts an array using bubble sort and determine a loop invariant for the sorting process.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant for Bubble Sort:**\n- For the outer loop, the loop invariant could be `sorted_elements_count = i`. This means that after the i-th iteration, the last i elements are sorted in place.\n- For the inner loop, the loop invariant could be `sorted_until_index = n-i-1`, meaning that after the j-th iteration, the elements up to index n-i-1 are in their correct positions relative to each other.\n\n### Related Problem 3:\n**Problem Statement:** Implement a function that sorts an array using insertion sort and determine a loop invariant for the sorting process.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        z = i - 1\n        while z >= 0 and arr[z] > key:\n            arr[z + 1] = arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        arr[z + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant for Insertion Sort:**\n- For the outer loop, the loop invariant could be `sorted_subarray_length = i`. This means that after the i-th iteration, the first i elements are sorted.\n- For the inner loop, the loop invariant could be `key_position = z + 1`, meaning that after the z-th iteration, the key (arr[i]) is placed at the correct position within the sorted subarray.\n\n### Original Problem:\n**Problem Statement:** Determine the loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm provided.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nThe provided insertion sort algorithm has two nested loops.
