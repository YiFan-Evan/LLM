Each problem involves counting occurrences of a specific value within an array, but they differ slightly in how the counting is done or what additional operations are performed.\n\n### Problem 1: Counting Specific Values Without Using a Function\n\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a loop to count how many times `target` appears in `arr`.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef count_target(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    for element in arr:\n        if element == target:\n            count_value += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nSince this is a different approach using a for-loop, we'll skip it for now as the original problem uses a while-loop.\n\n### Problem 2: Counting Specific Values with a While Loop\n\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a loop using a while loop to count how many times `target` appears in `arr`.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef count_target_while(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        if arr[e] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        e += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nThe loop invariant for this while loop would be `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[:e] if x == target)`.\n\n### Problem 3: Counting Specific Values with Additional Conditions\n\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a loop to count how many times `target` appears in `arr`, but only after a certain condition is met (e.g., `e` must be greater than 2).\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef count_target_with_condition(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        if e > 2 and arr[e] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        e += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nThe loop invariant for this while loop would be `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[3:e] if x == target)`.\n\n### Original Problem: Counting Specific Values with a While Loop\n\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a loop using a while loop to count how many times `target` appears in `arr`.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        if arr[e] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        e += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nThe loop invariant for this while loop can be expressed as:\n\n```plaintext\ncount_value = sum(1 for x in arr[:e] if x == target)\n```\n\nThis means that at any point during the execution of the loop, `count_value` contains the number of elements equal to `target` from the start of the array up to the current index `e`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\ncount_value = sum(1 for x in arr[:e] if x == target)\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) -
