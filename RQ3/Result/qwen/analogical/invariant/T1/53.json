Specifically, it should capture the fact that `count_value` correctly represents the count of `target` up to the current index `n`.\n\nGiven the loop runs until `n` reaches `len(arr)`, we can write the invariant as:\n\n- `count_value = count(arr[0]->arr[n-1], target)`\n\nThis means that at the beginning of each iteration, `count_value` contains the number of times `target` appears in the subarray `arr[0]` through `arr[n-1]`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `count_value = count(arr[0]->arr[n-1], target)`"}]
