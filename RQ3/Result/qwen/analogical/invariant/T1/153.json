To prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true at the beginning of each iteration of the loop.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be stated as:\n\n```plaintext\nsum_value = sum(arr[0] -> arr[i-1])\n```\n\nThis means that at the start of the i-th iteration, `sum_value` contains the sum of the elements from the start of the array up to, but not including, the current index `i`.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- At the start of the loop (`i=0`), `sum_value` is initialized to `0`, which is correct because there are no elements to sum.\n- During each iteration, `sum_value` is incremented by `arr[n]`, where `n` is the current index. This maintains the invariant that `sum_value` contains the sum of the elements processed so far.\n- When the loop terminates, `sum_value` contains the sum of all elements in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nsum_value = sum(arr[0] -> arr[n-1])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    n = 0\n    while n <= len(arr) - 1:\n        sum_value += arr[n]\n        n += 1\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address the given problem, we need to identify a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the function `give_sum`. Let's break down the problem and provide a detailed analysis and solution.\n\n### Problem Description:\nThe function `give_sum` sums all elements of an array `arr` using a `while` loop. The loop condition is `n <= len(arr) - 1`, which ensures that the loop runs until the last element of the array is processed.\n\n### Solution:\nWe need to find a loop invariant that holds true at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. The loop invariant should help us understand how the variable `sum_value` changes with each iteration.\n\n#### Loop Invariant:\nAt the start of the i-th iteration of the loop, `sum_value` is the sum of the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`.\n\nFormally, we can write the loop invariant as:\n```plaintext\nsum_value = sum(arr[0] -> arr[n-1])\n```\n\n#### Explanation:\n- **Initialization:** At the start of the loop (`n = 0`), `sum_value` is initialized to `0`. Since there are no elements processed yet, the invariant holds true because the sum of zero elements is `0`.\n- **Maintenance:** During each iteration, `sum_value` is incremented by `arr[n]`, and `n` is incremented by `1`. This maintains the invariant that `sum_value` contains the sum of the elements processed so far.\n- **Termination:** When the loop terminates (`n > len(arr) - 1`), `sum_value` contains the sum of all elements in the array.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nsum_value = sum(arr[0] -> arr[n-1])\n```"}]
