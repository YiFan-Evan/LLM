First, the variable `i` is not defined; it should be `n`. Second, the loop condition in the outer loop (`n <= len(arr) - 1`) is correct but can be simplified to `n < len(arr)`.\n\nLet's correct these issues and then provide the loop invariant.\n\n### Corrected Code:\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = 0\n    while n < len(arr):\n        z = n\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        n += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant Analysis:\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant:\nWe need to show that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `n` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n**Invariant:** `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-1])`\n\nThis means that after the i-th iteration, the subarray from index 0 to index `n-1` is sorted.\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant:\nWe need to show that during the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the element at index `z` is moved to its correct position within the already sorted part of the array.\n\n**Invariant:** `temp_value = fun(arr[z]->arr[z+1])`\n\nThis means that the value at index `z` is correctly placed relative to the values in the range `[z+1, n-1]`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- **Outer Loop Invariant:** `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-1])`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant:** `temp_value = fun(arr[z]->arr[z+1])`"}]
