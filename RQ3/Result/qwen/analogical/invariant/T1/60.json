The function aims to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` is not found, it returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for this function can be stated as:\n- Loop Invariant: `id_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[a-1])`\n\nThis means that at the start of each iteration, `id_value` holds the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the subarray `arr[0]->arr[a-1]`. Initially, `id_value` is set to `-1`, indicating that no target has been found yet.\n\n#### Problem 2\n**Description:** \nConsider a modified version of the function `give_id` where the function returns the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` instead of the first occurrence. If `target` is not found, it still returns `-1`.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for this function can be stated as:\n- Loop Invariant: `id_value = fun(arr[a+1]->arr[-1])`\n\nThis means that at the start of each iteration, `id_value` holds the index of the last occurrence of `target` in the subarray `arr[a+1]->arr[-1]`. Initially, `id_value` is set to `-1`, indicating that no target has been found yet.\n\n#### Problem 3\n**Description:** \nConsider another version of the function `give_id` where the function returns the total count of occurrences of `target` in `arr`. If `target` does not appear in `arr`, it returns `0`.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for this function can be stated as:\n- Loop Invariant: `count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[a-1])`\n\nThis means that at the start of each iteration, `count_value` holds the number of times `target` has appeared in the subarray `arr[0]->arr[a-1]`. Initially, `count_value` is set to `0`, indicating that no target has been found yet.\n\n### Original Problem Solution\n\nGiven the original function `give_id` which finds the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`:\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for this function can be stated as:\n- Loop Invariant: `id_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[a-1])`\n\nThis means that at the start of each iteration, `id_value` holds the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the subarray `arr[0]->arr[a-1]`.
