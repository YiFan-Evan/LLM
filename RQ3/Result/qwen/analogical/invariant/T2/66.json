If `target` does not exist in `arr`, return `-1`.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    g = 0\n    while g < len(arr):\n        if arr[g] == target:\n            id_value = g  # Corrected from i to g\n            break  # Exit loop once the first occurrence is found\n        g += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Occurrences of Target\n**Description**: Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, find the indices of all occurrences of `target` in `arr`. Return a list of these indices. If `target` does not exist in `arr`, return an empty list.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef find_all_occurrences(arr, target):\n    indices = []\n    g = 0\n    while g < len(arr):\n        if arr[g] == target:\n            indices.append(g)\n        g += 1\n    return indices\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Last Occurrence of Target\n**Description**: Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, find the index of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` does not exist in `arr`, return `-1`.\n\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    g = 0\n    while g < len(arr):\n        if arr[g] == target:\n            id_value = g\n        g += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Original Problem Solution\nNow, let's consider the original problem where we need to find the index of the first occurrence of the target value in the array using a loop invariant.\n\n**Original Problem Description**: Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`.

If `target` does not exist in `arr`, return `-1`.\n\n### Issues in the Provided Code\n1. The variable `i` is not defined within the loop.\n2. The loop condition `g < len(arr) - 1` might cause an off-by-one error.\n3. The variable `g` is initialized to `-1`, which is unconventional and may lead to confusion.\n\n### Corrected Code\nLet's correct the code to ensure it works properly:\n\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    g = 0\n    while g < len(arr):\n        if arr[g] == target:\n            id_value = g\n            break  # Exit loop once the first occurrence is found\n        g += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant\nFor the loop invariant, we need to state that after the i-th iteration of the loop, `id_value` contains the index of the first occurrence of `target` among the elements `arr[0]` through `arr[g]`.\n\n### Loop Invariant Statement\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n```plaintext\nid_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g])\n```\nWhere `fun` is a function that returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` among the elements `arr[0]` through `arr[g]`.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nid_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g])\n```"}]
