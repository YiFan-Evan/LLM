Let's break down the problem into three related but not identical problems.\n\n### Problem 1: Understanding the Selection Sort Algorithm\n**Description:** \nSelection Sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array:\n1. The subarray which is already sorted.\n2. The remaining subarray which is unsorted.\n\n**Solution:**\n- In each iteration of the outer loop, the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array is moved to the end of the sorted part.\n- After `j` iterations, the first `j` elements are sorted and are in their correct positions.\n\n### Problem 2: Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop\n**Description:** \nWe need to define a loop invariant for the outer loop that proves the partial correctness of the Selection Sort algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**\n- A loop invariant for the outer loop can be defined as follows: after the `j`-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `j` elements of the array are the smallest `j` elements in the array, and they are sorted.\n\n### Problem 3: Formalizing the Loop Invariant\n**Description:** \nWe need to formalize the loop invariant in terms of the array elements and their indices.\n\n**Solution:**\n- We can express the loop invariant as: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:j])`, where `fun` represents the property that the first `j` elements are the smallest `j` elements and are sorted.\n\n### Original Problem: Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop of Selection Sort\n**Description:** \nWe need to provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop of the Selection Sort algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Therefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be expressed as:\n  - `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:i])`, where `fun` indicates that the first `i` elements are the smallest `i` elements and are sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:j])`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        j += 1\n        z = j + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[j]:\n                temp = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address the problem, we need to define a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the provided selection sort algorithm.
