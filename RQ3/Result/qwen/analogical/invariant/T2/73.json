Each problem will have a slightly different context or objective, but they will all involve loops and finding some kind of value based on an array.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding the Index of the First Occurrence\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function that returns the index of the first occurrence of the target in the array. If the target is not found, return -1.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n```python\ndef find_first_occurrence(arr, target):\n    index_value = -1\n    n = 0\n    while n < len(arr):\n        if arr[n] == target:\n            index_value = n\n            break\n        n += 1\n    return index_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n```plaintext\nindex_value = -1 if arr[n] != target else n for all n < i\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding the Index of the Last Occurrence\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function that returns the index of the last occurrence of the target in the array. If the target is not found, return -1.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n```python\ndef find_last_occurrence(arr, target):\n    index_value = -1\n    n = 0\n    while n < len(arr):\n        if arr[n] == target:\n            index_value = n\n        n += 1\n    return index_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n```plaintext\nindex_value = -1 if arr[n] != target else n for all n <= i\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding All Indices of the Target\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function that returns a list of indices where the target occurs in the array. If the target is not found, return an empty list.\n\n**Solution Code:**\n```python\ndef find_all_indices(arr, target):\n    indices = []\n    n = 0\n    while n < len(arr):\n        if arr[n] == target:\n            indices.append(n)\n        n += 1\n    return indices\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n```plaintext\nindices = [i for i in range(n) if arr[i] == target] for all n <= i\n```\n\n### Original Problem: Finding the Index of the First Occurrence with Incorrect Code\n**Description:** \nGiven an array `arr` and a target value `target`, write a function that returns the index of the first occurrence of the target in the array.

If the target is not found, it returns `-1`.\n\n### Provided Code:\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        if arr[n] == target:\n            id_value = n\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Analysis:\n- **Initialization**: `id_value` is initialized to `-1`.\n- **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `n < len(arr) - 1`.\n- **Update**: `n` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n- **Condition Check**: If `arr[n]` equals `target`, `id_value` is set to `n`.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\nWe need to ensure that at the start of each iteration, `id_value` correctly represents the index of the first occurrence of the target up to that point. \n\nThe loop invariant should capture that `id_value` holds the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr[0:n+1]` before the next iteration starts.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\n```plaintext\nid_value = -1 if no element in arr[0:n+1] equals target else the index of the first occurrence of target in arr[0:n+1]\n```\n\n### Rewriting the Invariant:\nThis can be expressed more formally as:\n```plaintext\nid_value = -1 if arr[k] != target for all k in range(0, n+1) else the smallest k such that arr[k] == target for k in range(0, n+1)\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: id_value = -1 if arr[k] != target for all k in range(0, n+1) else the smallest k such that arr[k] == target for k in range(0, n+1)\n```"}]
