Provide a loop invariant for the outer while loop (with variable `k`) after the i-th iteration to prove the partial correctness of the program.\n\n**Solution 1:**  \nThe loop invariant for the outer while loop can be stated as:\n- After the i-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:i]` contains the smallest `i` elements from the original array, but they may not be in sorted order yet.\n\n**Problem 2:**  \nNow consider the inner while loop (with variable `z`) in the `selection_sort` function. Provide a loop invariant for the inner while loop after the i-th iteration to prove the partial correctness of the program.\n\n**Solution 2:**  \nThe loop invariant for the inner while loop can be stated as:\n- After the i-th iteration, the element at index `k` is the minimum value among `arr[k+1:len(arr)]`.\n\n**Problem 3:**  \nFinally, let's focus on the entire `selection_sort` function. Provide a loop invariant for the entire while loop (considering both `k` and `z` iterations) to prove the partial correctness of the program.\n\n**Solution 3:**  \nThe loop invariant for the entire while loop can be stated as:\n- After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:k]` contains the smallest `k` elements from the original array, and these `k` elements are in sorted order relative to each other.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:k]->arr[0:k])`\n- `min_value = fun(arr[k+1:len(arr)]->arr[k+1:len(arr)])`\n\nHere, `fun` represents the function that describes the state of the subarrays after the i-th iteration.
