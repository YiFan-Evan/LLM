Your task is to identify a loop invariant for the outer loop (controlled by the variable `t`). This loop invariant should hold true before the first iteration of the outer loop, be maintained throughout the iterations of the loop, and ensure the correctness of the algorithm when the loop terminates.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- Before the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the smallest element among `arr[t]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]` is located at `arr[t]`.\n\nThis loop invariant can be written as:\n- `min_value = min(arr[t:len(arr)]) = arr[t]`\n\n### Problem 2\n**Description:**  \nAnalyze the inner loop of the `selection_sort` function, which is controlled by the variable `z`. Your goal is to find a loop invariant that holds true before the first iteration of the inner loop, remains true after each iteration, and helps to prove the correctness of the sorting algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- Before the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the elements from `arr[t+1]` to `arr[z-1]` are already sorted such that each element is less than or equal to the next element.\n\nThis loop invariant can be written as:\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[t+1:z]) = arr[t+1:z]`\n\n### Problem 3\n**Description:**  \nGiven the `selection_sort` function, identify a loop invariant that can be used to prove the correctness of the sorting process. Specifically, this invariant should hold true before the first iteration of the outer loop, remain true after each iteration of the outer loop, and help to demonstrate the final sorted state of the array.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThe loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- Before the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:t]` is sorted and contains the `t` smallest elements from the original array.\n\nThis loop invariant can be written as:\n- `sorted_subarray_value = sorted(arr[0:t]) = arr[0:t]`\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_subarray_value = sorted(arr[0:t]) = arr[0:t]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    t = -1\n    while t < len(arr) - 1:\n        t += 1\n        z = t + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[t]:\n                temp = arr[t]\n                arr[t] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Problem 1\n**Description:**  \nConsider the modified `selection_sort` function where the outer loop starts with `t = -1` and increments `t` within the loop.
