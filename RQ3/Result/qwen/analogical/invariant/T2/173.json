Each problem will have a different focus, and we'll describe the issue and its solution.\n\n### Problem 1: Correctness of Inner Loop Invariant\n\n**Description:** \nWe want to prove that the inner loop correctly sorts elements up to a certain point. \n\n**Solution:**\nThe inner loop starts from `i` and moves backward until it finds the correct position for `arr[i]`. After each iteration of the inner loop, the elements from `0` to `n-1` are sorted.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** \n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-1])\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Correctness of Outer Loop Invariant\n\n**Description:** \nWe want to prove that after each iteration of the outer loop, the first `n` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe outer loop iterates over the array, and for each element `n`, it uses the inner loop to place the element in its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** \n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-1])\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Correctness of Final Array\n\n**Description:** \nWe want to prove that after the entire loop completes, the array is fully sorted.\n\n**Solution:**\nAfter the outer loop completes all iterations, the array should be completely sorted. This means that the last element `n-1` has been placed in its correct position, and the entire array is sorted.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** \n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[len(arr)-1])\n```\n\n### Answer to Original Problem\n\nGiven the analysis above, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the provided `insertion_sort` function is:\n\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-1])\n```\n\nThis indicates that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `n` elements of the array are sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-1])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address the given problem, let's break it down into three related but not identical problems.
