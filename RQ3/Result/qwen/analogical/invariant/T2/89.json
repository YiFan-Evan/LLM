The program initializes `last_value` with the first element of the array and iterates through the array to update `last_value` to the current element at each step. The loop invariant should capture the fact that `last_value` always holds the most recent value seen so far.\n\n**Function Name:** give_last\n\n**Solution:**  \nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we can use the loop invariant `last_value = arr[j-1]`.

However, since the update happens immediately after incrementing `j`, `last_value` actually holds the value of the element at index `j`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `last_value = arr[j]`."}]
