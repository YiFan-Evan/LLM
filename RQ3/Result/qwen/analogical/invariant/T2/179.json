Hence, after the inner loop completes, `arr[:t+1]` remains sorted.\n- **Termination:** When the outer loop terminates, `t` equals `len(arr) - 1`, meaning `arr[:t+1]` is the entire array `arr`, and it is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\"**sorted_value = fun(arr[:t+1])**\""}]
