Let's start by presenting three related problems and their solutions.\n\n### Problem 1: Simple Insertion Sort Invariant\n**Description:** Identify the loop invariant for the inner while loop of the insertion sort algorithm.\n**Solution:** The loop invariant for the inner while loop can be described as follows:\n- At the start of each iteration of the inner while loop, `z` is greater than 0 and `arr[z-1] > arr[z]`.\n- Therefore, after each swap, the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` are sorted.\n\n### Problem 2: Insertion Sort Invariant with Index Tracking\n**Description:** Identify the loop invariant for the inner while loop of the insertion sort algorithm, focusing on the indices involved.\n**Solution:** The loop invariant can be described as:\n- At the start of each iteration of the inner while loop, `z` is such that `arr[z-1] > arr[z]`.\n- Therefore, after each swap, `arr[z-1] <= arr[z]` holds true for all `z` from `i` down to the current value of `z`.\n\n### Problem 3: Insertion Sort Invariant with Element Swapping\n**Description:** Identify the loop invariant for the inner while loop of the insertion sort algorithm, focusing on the element swapping process.\n**Solution:** The loop invariant can be described as:\n- At the start of each iteration of the inner while loop, `arr[z-1] > arr[z]`.\n- Therefore, after each swap, the elements `arr[z-1]` and `arr[z]` are in the correct order relative to each other.\n\n### Original Problem: Loop Invariant for Insertion Sort\n**Solution:** Combining the insights from the above problems, we can describe the loop invariant for the inner while loop of the insertion sort algorithm as follows:\n- At the start of each iteration of the inner while loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` is sorted.\n- Therefore, after each swap, the elements `arr[z-1]` and `arr[z]` are in the correct order relative to each other.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be written as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:z+1]`\n\nHowever, to match the required format strictly:\n- `arr[0:z]_value = fun(arr[0:z]->arr[0:z])`\n\nThe most appropriate and specific loop invariant in the given format would be:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:z] -> arr[0:z])`\n\nSince the exact function `fun` isn't specified but we need to indicate the sorted portion, we can say:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:z+1]_sorted`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:z+1]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        i += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's consider three related problems before addressing the original one:\n\n### Problem 1: Simple Insertion Sort Invariant\n**Description:** Identify the loop invariant for the inner while loop of the insertion sort algorithm.\n**Solution:** The loop invariant for the inner while loop can be described as follows:\n- At the start of each iteration of the inner while loop, `arr[z-1] > arr[z]`.\n- After each swap, the elements `arr[z-1]` and `arr[z]` are in the correct order.\n\n### Problem 2: Insertion Sort Invariant with Index Tracking\n**Description:** Identify the loop invariant for the inner while loop of the insertion sort algorithm, focusing on the indices involved.\n**Solution:** The loop invariant can be described as:\n- At the start of each iteration of the inner while loop, `z` is such that `arr[z-1] > arr[z]`.\n- After each swap, `arr[z-1] <= arr[z]` holds true for all `z` from `i` down to the current value of `z`.\n\n### Problem 3: Insertion Sort Invariant with Element Swapping\n**Description:** Identify the loop invariant for the inner while loop of the insertion sort algorithm, focusing on the element swapping process.\n**Solution:** The loop invariant can be described as:\n- At the start of each iteration of the inner while loop, `arr[z-1] > arr[z]`.\n- After each swap, the elements `arr[z-1]` and `arr[z]` are in the correct order relative to each other.\n\n### Original Problem: Loop Invariant for Insertion Sort\n**Description:** Identify the loop invariant for the inner while loop of the given insertion sort algorithm.\n**Solution:** Based on the analysis of the previous problems, the loop invariant for the inner while loop can be stated as follows:\n- At the start of each iteration of the inner while loop, the subarray `arr[0:z]` is sorted.\n- After each swap, the elements `arr[z-1]` and `arr[z]` are in the correct order relative to each other.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be written in the required format as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:z]`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:z]`"}]
