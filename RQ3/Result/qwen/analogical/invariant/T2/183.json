Each problem will have its own loop invariant.\n\n### Problem 1: Selection Sort\n\n**Description**: Implement the selection sort algorithm on an array `arr`. After the algorithm completes, the array should be sorted in ascending order.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe key idea behind selection sort is to repeatedly find the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and place it at the beginning of the unsorted part.\n\n**Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (with index `d`), the subarray `arr[0:d]` contains the smallest `d` elements from the original array, in sorted order.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be written as:\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: smallest_d_values = fun(arr[0:d])\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Insertion Sort\n\n**Description**: Implement the insertion sort algorithm on an array `arr`. After the algorithm completes, the array should be sorted in ascending order.\n\n**Solution**:\nInsertion sort works by iterating through the array and inserting each element into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.\n\n**Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (with index `i`), the subarray `arr[0:i]` contains the first `i` elements from the original array, in sorted order.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be written as:\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: sorted_i_values = fun(arr[0:i])\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Bubble Sort\n\n**Description**: Implement the bubble sort algorithm on an array `arr`. After the algorithm completes, the array should be sorted in ascending order.\n\n**Solution**:\nBubble sort works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\n\n**Loop Invariant**: At the start of each pass through the array (with index `p`), the last `p` elements of the array are in their final sorted positions.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be written as:\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: last_p_sorted = fun(arr[-p:])\n```\n\n### Original Problem: Selection Sort Loop Invariant\n\n**Description**: Given the selection sort implementation provided, determine the loop invariant for the outer loop (with index `d`).\n\n**Solution**:\nAs explained earlier, selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and placing it at the beginning of the unsorted part.\n\n**Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (with index `d`), the subarray `arr[0:d]` contains the smallest `d` elements from the original array, in sorted order.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be written as:\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: smallest_d_values = fun(arr[0:d])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    d = -1\n    while d < len(arr) - 1:\n        d += 1\n        z = d + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[d]:\n                temp = arr[d]\n                arr[d] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Given the modified version of the selection sort algorithm where the initialization of `d` is set to `-1` and the condition in the outer loop is adjusted accordingly, let's determine the loop invariant for the outer loop.\n\n### Problem 1: Selection Sort with Adjusted Initialization\n\n**Description**: Implement the selection sort algorithm on an array `arr` with the initialization of `d` set to `-1`.
