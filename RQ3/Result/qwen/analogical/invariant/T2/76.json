If the target is not found, return `-1`.\n**Example**: \n- Input: `arr = [4, 5, 6, 5, 7], target = 5`\n- Output: `1` (since the first occurrence of `5` is at index `1`).\n\n#### Problem 2: Find the Last Occurrence ID of a Target Value\n**Description**: Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, find the index (ID) of the last occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If the target is not found, return `-1`.\n**Example**: \n- Input: `arr = [4, 5, 6, 5, 7], target = 5`\n- Output: `3` (since the last occurrence of `5` is at index `3`).\n\n#### Problem 3: Find All Occurrence IDs of a Target Value\n**Description**: Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, find all indices (IDs) where `target` occurs in `arr`. Return these indices as a list.\n**Example**: \n- Input: `arr = [4, 5, 6, 5, 7], target = 5`\n- Output: `[1, 3]` (since `5` occurs at indices `1` and `3`).\n\n### Original Problem: Find the First Occurrence ID of a Target Value\n\nThe given code snippet is intended to find the first occurrence of a target value in an array. However, there is an error in the code where `id_value` is being assigned the value of `i` instead of `q`. Let's correct this and then determine the loop invariant.\n\n**Corrected Code**:\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    q = 0\n    while q < len(arr):\n        if arr[q] == target:\n            id_value = q\n        q += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant Analysis\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to identify a loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop. \n\n**Loop Invariant**:\nThe loop invariant should capture the state of `id_value` after each iteration. Specifically, it should indicate that up to the current iteration, `id_value` holds the index of the first occurrence of the target value in the array.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\n```plaintext\nid_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])\n```\nWhere `fun` is a function that returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[q-1]`.\n\nSince `id_value` is updated only when `arr[q]` equals `target`, the invariant can be more precisely stated as:\n```plaintext\nid_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])\n```\nwhere `fun` returns `-1` if `target` does not appear in the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[q-1]`, or the smallest index `i` such that `arr[i] == target` otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nid_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    q = -1\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:\n        q += 1\n        if arr[q] == target:\n            id_value = i\n    return id_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Problem Description\n\n#### Problem 1: Find the First Occurrence ID of a Target Value\n**Description**: Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, find the index (ID) of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`.
