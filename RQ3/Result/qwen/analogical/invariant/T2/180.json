The goal is to ensure that after each iteration of the outer loop, the first `a` elements are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n**Solution**:\nA loop invariant for the outer loop could be stated as:\n- After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `a` elements of `arr` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Problem 2: Selection Sort Loop Invariant - Inner Loop\n\n**Description**: \nThe inner loop iterates through each element of the array starting from index `z` (which starts at `a+1`) up to the length of the array minus one. The goal is to find the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array and swap it with the element at index `a`.\n\n**Solution**:\nA loop invariant for the inner loop could be stated as:\n- After the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the smallest element in the subarray `arr[a+1]` to `arr[z]` has been found and is ready to be swapped with `arr[a]`.\n\n### Problem 3: Combining Both Loop Invariants\n\n**Description**: \nCombining both loop invariants helps us understand the overall correctness of the selection sort algorithm. We need to ensure that after the completion of both loops, the entire array is sorted.\n\n**Solution**:\nCombining the invariants, we can state:\n- After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `a` elements of `arr` are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array is correctly positioned at index `a`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[:a+1] -> arr[:a+1])` (indicating that the first `a+1` elements are sorted)\n- `unsorted_min_value = fun(arr[a+1:len(arr)] -> arr[a+1:len(arr)])` (indicating that the minimum element in the unsorted portion is correctly positioned)\n\nSince we need to present the invariant in a single statement format, we focus on the primary invariant which is about the sorted portion:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[:a+1] -> arr[:a+1])`\n\nThus, the final loop invariant in the required format is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[:a+1] -> arr[:a+1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    a = -1\n    while a < len(arr) - 1:\n        a += 1\n        z = a + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[a]:\n                temp = arr[a]\n                arr[a] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address the problem, let's break it down into simpler components and understand the role of each loop within the context of the selection sort algorithm.\n\n### Problem 1: Selection Sort Loop Invariant - Outer Loop\n\n**Description**: \nThe outer loop increments the variable `a` from `-1` to `len(arr) - 2`.

Therefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[:a+1] -> arr[:a+1])`\n\nThis indicates that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `a+1` elements of `arr` are sorted in non-decreasing order. Thus, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[:a+1] -> arr[:a+1])`"}]
