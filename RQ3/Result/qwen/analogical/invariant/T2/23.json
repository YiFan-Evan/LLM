The loop starts with `d = -1` and increments `d` in each iteration until it reaches `len(arr) - 1`. \n\n- **Loop Invariant:** `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[d])`\n\nThis invariant means that at the start of each iteration, `min_value` holds the smallest element seen so far in the subarray from index 0 to `d`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[d])`"}]
