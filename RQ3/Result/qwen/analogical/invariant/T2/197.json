If the current element `arr[z]` is smaller than `arr[r]`, then `arr[r]` and `arr[z]` are swapped.

After each iteration of the outer loop, the first `r` elements of the array are sorted, and the remaining elements are unsorted.\n\nFormally, we can write the loop invariant for the outer loop as:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[:r]`\n\nAgain, to fit the required format:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[:r]`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n- For the inner loop: `arr[r]_value = min(arr[r+1:z+1])`\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = arr[:r]` \n\nHowever, since the question asks specifically for the inner loop invariant, the final answer is:\n\n- Therefore, the final answer is: `arr[r]_value = min(arr[r+1:z+1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        z = r + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[r]:\n                temp = arr[r]\n                arr[r] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Related Problems\n\n**Problem 1:**\n- **Description:** Implement a selection sort algorithm where the smallest element is found in the unsorted portion of the array and swapped with the element at the beginning of the unsorted portion.\n- **Solution:** The given code already implements this correctly.\n\n**Problem 2:**\n- **Description:** Implement a bubble sort algorithm where adjacent elements are compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order until the array is sorted.\n- **Solution:** This is a different sorting algorithm from selection sort and would involve a different approach, typically involving nested loops but comparing adjacent elements rather than finding the minimum.\n\n**Problem 3:**\n- **Description:** Implement an insertion sort algorithm where elements are inserted into their correct position within the sorted portion of the array.\n- **Solution:** This involves shifting elements to make space for the current element being considered and inserting it in the correct position.\n\n### Loop Invariant Analysis\n\nLet's analyze the given `selection_sort` function to determine the loop invariant for the inner loop.\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nThe inner loop starts at index `r+1` and iterates through the array, finding the smallest element in the subarray `arr[r+1:]`.
