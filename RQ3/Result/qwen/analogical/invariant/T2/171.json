It sorts the array up to index `l`. We want to find a loop invariant for the inner loop that proves the correctness of the sorting operation.\n\n**Code Snippet**:\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr):\n        z = i  # Note: This line seems incorrect, it should probably be `z = l`\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- After the `k`-th iteration of the inner loop, the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n- Therefore, we can write the loop invariant as: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[z])`.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: \nConsider the same code snippet but focus on the outer loop. We want to find a loop invariant for the outer loop that proves the correctness of the sorting operation.\n\n**Code Snippet**:\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr):\n        z = l\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \nThe loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- After the `i`-th iteration of the outer loop, the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[l-1]` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n- Therefore, we can write the loop invariant as: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[l-1])`.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: \nConsider the same code snippet but with a slight modification where we fix the initialization of `z` in the inner loop to be `z = l` instead of `z = i`. We want to find a loop invariant for the inner loop that proves the correctness of the sorting operation.\n\n**Code Snippet**:\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr):\n        z = l\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant**: \nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- After the `k`-th iteration of the inner loop, the elements `arr[l-k]` to `arr[l]` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n- Therefore, we can write the loop invariant as: `sorted_value = fun(arr[l-k] -> arr[l])`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nCombining the insights from the previous problems, the correct loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the given code snippet is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[l-1])`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = -1\n    while l < len(arr) - 1:\n        l += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, let's break it down into three related but not identical problems, focusing on different aspects of the insertion sort algorithm.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Description**: \nConsider the given insertion sort algorithm.
