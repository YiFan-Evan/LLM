Here are three related problems with their descriptions and solutions:\n\n### Problem 1: Selection Sort Outer Loop Invariant\n**Description:** Identify the loop invariant for the outer loop of the `selection_sort` function.\n**Solution:** The outer loop iterates over the array, and at each iteration, it finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and places it at the beginning of the unsorted portion.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** \n- After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first i elements of the array are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n**Format:** \n- Therefore, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be expressed as: `sorted_elements = arr[:m]`.\n\n### Problem 2: Selection Sort Inner Loop Invariant\n**Description:** Identify the loop invariant for the inner loop of the `selection_sort` function.\n**Solution:** The inner loop iterates over the unsorted portion of the array to find the minimum element and swap it with the current element being considered by the outer loop.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** \n- After the j-th iteration of the inner loop, the element at index `m` is the smallest element in the subarray `arr[m+1:z]`.\n\n**Format:** \n- Therefore, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be expressed as: `min_element = min(arr[m+1:z+1])`.\n\n### Problem 3: Combined Loop Invariant for Selection Sort\n**Description:** Combine the loop invariants of both loops to describe the state of the array after each iteration.\n**Solution:** Combining the loop invariants, we can describe the state of the array after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\n**Combined Loop Invariant:** \n- After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first i elements of the array are sorted in non-decreasing order, and the remaining elements are unsorted.\n\n**Format:** \n- Therefore, the combined loop invariant can be expressed as: `sorted_elements = arr[:m]` and `unsorted_elements = arr[m:]`.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_elements = arr[:m]` and `min_element = min(arr[m+1:z+1])`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    m = -1\n    while m < len(arr) - 1:\n        m += 1\n        z = m + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[m]:\n                temp = arr[m]\n                arr[m] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we need to identify the loop invariant for the outer loop and the inner loop of the modified `selection_sort` function.
