[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

In each iteration, the current element is compared with `min_value`, and if it is smaller, `min_value` is updated.\n\n**Solution**:\nThe loop invariant for this version could be `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[c-1])`, assuming the loop starts from `c=1`.\n\n### Problem 3\n**Description**: \nAnother variation of `find_min` where the loop iterates from the last element to the first element of the array, and the initial value of `min_value` is set to the last element of the array.
