We need to determine the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\n**Answer**:\nIn the original code, the inner loop ensures that elements from index `0` to `i-1` are sorted in ascending order. Therefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration can be expressed as:\n\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0:i])`\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0:i])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = -1\n    while g < len(arr) - 1:\n        g += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address the problem, we need to first understand the provided code and then determine the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program.\n\n### Problem Description and Analysis\n\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = -1\n    while g < len(arr) - 1:\n        g += 1\n        z = g\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\nThe outer loop runs from `g = -1` to `g = len(arr) - 2`, which means it iterates over each element of the array starting from the second element.
