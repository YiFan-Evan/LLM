Each problem will help us understand different aspects of sorting algorithms.\n\n### Problem 1: Simple Selection Sort\n\n**Description:** \nImplement a simple selection sort algorithm where the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array is selected and moved to the beginning of the unsorted portion.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        min_index = i\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant for Problem 1:**\n```plaintext\nmin_index_value = min(arr[i:n])\n```\nThis invariant means that at the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the minimum value in the subarray from index `i` to `n-1` is stored in `min_index`.\n\n### Problem 2: Insertion Sort\n\n**Description:** \nImplement an insertion sort algorithm where each element is inserted into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant for Problem 2:**\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = sorted(arr[:i])\n```\nThis invariant means that at the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray from index `0` to `i-1` is already sorted.\n\n### Problem 3: Bubble Sort\n\n**Description:** \nImplement a bubble sort algorithm where adjacent elements are swapped if they are in the wrong order, and this process is repeated until the array is sorted.\n\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant for Problem 3:**\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = sorted(arr[n-i:n])\n```\nThis invariant means that at the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the last `i` elements of the array are already sorted.\n\n### Original Problem: Selection Sort with Loop Invariant\n\nNow, let's consider the original `selection_sort` function and provide a loop invariant.\n\n**Original Function:**\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    g = 0\n    while g < len(arr):\n        z = g + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[g]:\n                temp = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        g += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant for the Original Problem:**\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = sorted(arr[:g])\n```\nThis invariant means that at the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray from index `0` to `g-1` is already sorted.\n\n**Explanation:**\nAt the start of each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `g`), the subarray from index `0` to `g-1` contains the smallest `g` elements of the array, sorted in ascending order.
