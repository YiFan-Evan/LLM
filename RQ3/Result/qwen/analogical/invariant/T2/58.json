Prove the partial correctness of the program by providing a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**  \nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:  \n`count_value = sum(arr[-1]->arr[s-1] == target)`  \n\nThis means that at the i-th iteration, `count_value` contains the sum of all occurrences of `target` in the subarray `arr[-1]` to `arr[s-1]`.\n\nHowever, since the loop starts with `s = -1` and increments `s` by 1 in each iteration, the correct loop invariant should reflect the actual state of the array elements checked up to the current iteration. Therefore, the correct loop invariant is:\n\n`count_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[s-1] == target)`  \n\nThis means that at the i-th iteration, `count_value` contains the sum of all occurrences of `target` in the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[s-1]`.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**  \n`count_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[s-1] == target)`"}]
