If the target value is not found, return -1.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef find_first_occurrence(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    d = 0\n    while d < len(arr):\n        if arr[d] == target:\n            id_value = d\n            break\n        d += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for this problem can be stated as:\n- `id_value = -1 if arr[0]->arr[d-1] do not contain target else min(i | arr[i] == target and 0 <= i < d)`\n\n### Problem 2: Counting Occurrences of a Target Value\n\n**Description:** \nThe goal is to count the number of occurrences of a target value in an array.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef count_target_occurrences(arr, target):\n    count = 0\n    d = 0\n    while d < len(arr):\n        if arr[d] == target:\n            count += 1\n        d += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n**Solution:**\nThe loop invariant for this problem can be stated as:\n- `count = sum(1 for i in range(d) if arr[i] == target)`\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Last Occurrence of a Target Value\n\n**Description:** \nThe goal is to find the index of the last occurrence of a target value in an array.

If the target value is not found, return -1. However, the code provided has a few issues:\n1. `d` starts at -1, which is incorrect.\n2. `id_value` is assigned `i` instead of `d` when the target is found.\n\n**Corrected Code:**\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    d = 0\n    while d < len(arr):\n        if arr[d] == target:\n            id_value = d\n            break\n        d += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- `id_value = -1 if arr[0]->arr[d-1] do not contain target else min(i | arr[i] == target and 0 <= i < d)`\n\n**Final Answer:**\nTherefore, the final answer is: `id_value = -1 if arr[0]->arr[d-1] do not contain target else min(i | arr[i] == target and 0 <= i < d)`"}]
