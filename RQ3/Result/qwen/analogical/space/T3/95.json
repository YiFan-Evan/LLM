What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The police van is the 4th element on the path.\n- Moving 6 steps clockwise from the police van, you pass through: hard disk drive (5th), green iguana (6th), Great Dane (7th), spiny lobster (8th), cauliflower (9th), and finally stop at the tricycle (10th).\n\nTherefore, the item you find is the **tricycle**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the police van, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The police van is the 4th element on the path.\n- Moving 4 steps clockwise from the police van, you pass through: hard disk drive (5th), green iguana (6th), Great Dane (7th), and finally stop at the spiny lobster (8th).\n\nTherefore, the item you find is the **spiny lobster**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the police van, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction, and then by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start from the police van (4th element).\n- Move 6 steps clockwise: you end up at the tricycle (10th element).\n- From the tricycle, move 4 steps clockwise: you pass through the rapeseed (1st), gas mask (2nd), palace (3rd), and stop at the police van (4th).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **police van**. \n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the item found after the movements and not the position, let's re-evaluate the final step:\n\n- After moving 6 steps from the police van, you reach the tricycle.\n- Then, moving 4 more steps from the tricycle, you pass through: rapeseed, gas mask, palace, and stop at the police van.\n\nThe item you find after the second movement is the **police van**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **police van**. \n\nSince the question specifically asks for the item and not the position, it appears there might be an error in the interpretation.
