Valley \u2192 English Springer Spaniel (1 step)\n2. English Springer Spaniel \u2192 Harvestman (2 steps)\n3. Harvestman \u2192 Earth Star (3 steps)\n\n**Answer:** Earth Star\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** \nYou start at the dot labeled \"valley\" and move 10 steps counterclockwise.\n- **Starting Position:** Valley\n- **Movement:** 10 steps counterclockwise\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting at the valley and moving 10 steps counterclockwise:\n1. Valley \u2192 Border Terrier (1 step counterclockwise)\n2. Border Terrier \u2192 Ground Beetle (2 steps counterclockwise)\n3. Ground Beetle \u2192 Analog Clock (3 steps counterclockwise)\n4.

English Springer Spaniel \u2192 Valley (10 steps counterclockwise)\n\nSince moving 10 steps counterclockwise from the valley brings you back to the valley itself, the final position is still the valley.\n\n**Answer:** Valley\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** \nYou start at the dot labeled \"valley,\" move 3 steps clockwise, then move 10 steps counterclockwise.\n- **Starting Position:** Valley\n- **Movement:** 3 steps clockwise, then 10 steps counterclockwise\n\n**Solution:**\nFirst, move 3 steps clockwise from the valley:\n1. Valley \u2192 Border Terrier (1 step)\n2. Border Terrier \u2192 Ground Beetle (2 steps)\n3. Ground Beetle \u2192 Analog Clock (3 steps)\n\nNow, move 10 steps counterclockwise from the Analog Clock:\n1. Analog Clock \u2192 Bra (1 step counterclockwise)\n2. Bra \u2192 Australian Silky Terrier (2 steps counterclockwise)\n3. Australian Silky Terrier \u2192 Cassette (3 steps counterclockwise)\n4. Cassette \u2192 Earth Star (4 steps counterclockwise)\n5. Earth Star \u2192 Harvestman (5 steps counterclockwise)\n6. Harvestman \u2192 English Springer Spaniel (6 steps counterclockwise)\n7. English Springer Spaniel \u2192 Valley (7 steps counterclockwise)\n8. Valley \u2192 Border Terrier (8 steps counterclockwise)\n9. Border Terrier \u2192 Ground Beetle (9 steps counterclockwise)\n10.
