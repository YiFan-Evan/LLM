Here are three related problems and their solutions:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the Cairn Terrier, move around the ring by 16 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe sequence starting from the Cairn Terrier (position 2) is as follows:\n- Position 2: Cairn Terrier\n- Position 3: Electric Guitar\n- Position 4: Crate\n- Position 5: Balloon\n- Position 6: Car Wheel\n- Position 7: Dandie Dinmont Terrier\n- Position 8: Collie\n- Position 9: Newfoundland\n- Position 10: Giant Schnauzer\n- Position 11: Whippet\n- Position 12: Volleyball\n- Position 13: Stopwatch\n- Position 14: Joystick\n- Position 15: Wild Boar\n- Position 16: Warthog\n- Position 17: Mobile Phone\n\nAfter moving 16 steps clockwise from the Cairn Terrier, you find a Mobile Phone.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Mobile Phone (position 17), move around the ring by 36 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nSince the path has 20 positions, moving 36 steps is equivalent to moving \\(36 \\mod 20 = 16\\) steps.
