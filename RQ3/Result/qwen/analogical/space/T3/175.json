Let's break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the dot with the rocking chair, move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the rocking chair (position 14), moving 10 steps clockwise lands you on the chain mail (position 4).\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the dot with the chain mail, move around the ring by 24 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the chain mail (position 4), moving 24 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the same position because 24 mod 20 = 4. Therefore, you remain at the chain mail (position 4).\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the dot with the chain mail, move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the chain mail (position 4), moving 10 steps clockwise lands you on the wok (position 14).\n\nNow, continuing from the wok, move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the wok (position 14), moving 6 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the castle (position 8).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: castle"}]
