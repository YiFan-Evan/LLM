You move 11 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: Starting from the European garden spider (position 15), moving 11 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards through the list. The positions are as follows:\n  - 15 \u2192 4 (European garden spider to thimble)\nSo, you end up on the thimble.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: From the new position (thimble), you then move 11 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: Starting from the thimble (position 13), moving 11 steps clockwise means moving forward through the list. The positions are as follows:\n  - 13 \u2192 4 (thimble to spindle)\n  - 4 \u2192 15 (spindle to European garden spider)\n  - 15 \u2192 6 (European garden spider to killer whale)\n  - 6 \u2192 17 (killer whale to shoji)\n  - 17 \u2192 8 (shoji to English Springer Spaniel)\n  - 8 \u2192 19 (English Springer Spaniel to traffic light)\n  - 19 \u2192 10 (traffic light to thimble)\n  - 10 \u2192 21 (thimble to spindle, wrap around)\n  - 21 \u2192 2 (spindle to plectrum, wrap around)\n  - 2 \u2192 13 (plectrum to thimble)\n  - 13 \u2192 20 (thimble to shopping cart)\nSo, you end up on the shopping cart.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: Confirming the final position after the two moves.\n- **Solution**: Combining both moves, starting from the European garden spider and moving 11 steps counter-clockwise to the thimble, then moving 11 steps clockwise from the thimble, results in landing on the shopping cart.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: shopping cart"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
