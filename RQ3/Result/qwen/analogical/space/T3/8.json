What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**: Starting from the warthog, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise means you will pass the trombone (1 step) and end up at the chambered nautilus (2 steps). Therefore, the item you find is the chambered nautilus.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the warthog, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**: Starting from the warthog, moving 3 steps clockwise means you will pass the trombone (1 step), the pizza (2 steps), and the hook (3 steps). Therefore, the item you find is the hook.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the warthog, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction and then by 3 steps in a clockwise direction.

Therefore, the item you find is the warthog.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the warthog, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction and then by 6 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - First, move 4 steps counter-clockwise from the warthog, landing on the chambered nautilus.\n  - Then, move 6 steps clockwise from the chambered nautilus, landing on the warthog.\n\nHowever, since the total movement in the clockwise direction after counter-clockwise movement is effectively equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (because 4 steps counter-clockwise + 6 steps clockwise = 5 steps clockwise, which is equivalent to 0 steps due to the circular nature of the path), you will land back on the warthog.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: warthog"}]
