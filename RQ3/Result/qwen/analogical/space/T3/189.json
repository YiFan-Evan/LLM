Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the breakwater, move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The breakwater is the 7th element.\n- Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise from the 7th element lands us on the 7 - 14 = -7th element, which is equivalent to 20 - 7 = 13th element (since we are on a circular path with 20 elements).\n- The 13th element is the dust jacket.\n\nTherefore, the item found is the **dust jacket**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the breakwater, move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then move around the ring by 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the breakwater (7th element), moving 14 steps counter-clockwise brings us to the dust jacket (13th element).\n- Moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from the dust jacket (13th element) brings us back to the same position because 20 steps on a 20-element path completes a full circle.\n- The 13th element is the dust jacket.\n\nTherefore, the item found is the **dust jacket**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the breakwater, move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 36 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the breakwater (7th element), moving 14 steps counter-clockwise brings us to the dust jacket (13th element).\n- Moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from the dust jacket (13th element) brings us back to the same position (13th element).\n- Moving 36 steps counter-clockwise from the dust jacket (13th element) is equivalent to moving 36 mod 20 = 16 steps counter-clockwise, landing us on the 13 - 16 = -3rd element, which is equivalent to 20 - 3 = 17th element.\n- The 17th element is the minibus.\n\nTherefore, the item found is the **minibus**.\n\n### Final Problem:\nStarting from the breakwater, move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 36 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally by 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the breakwater (7th element), moving 14 steps counter-clockwise brings us to the dust jacket (13th element).\n- Moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from the dust jacket (13th element) brings us back to the same position (13th element).\n- Moving 36 steps counter-clockwise from the dust jacket (13th element) is equivalent to moving 36 mod 20 = 16 steps counter-clockwise, landing us on the 13 - 16 = -3rd element, which is equivalent to 20 - 3 = 17th element (minibus).\n- Moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from the minibus (17th element) brings us to the 17 - 10 = 7th element, which is the breakwater.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **breakwater**."}]
