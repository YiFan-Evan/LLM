What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - The vestment is the 4th element on the list.\n  - Moving 2 steps clockwise: 5th element is a coyote.\n  - Therefore, the final answer is: coyote.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the vestment, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - The vestment is the 4th element on the list.\n  - Moving 5 steps clockwise: 9th element is an Irish Setter.\n  - Therefore, the final answer is: Irish Setter.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the vestment, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - The vestment is the 4th element on the list.\n  - Moving 8 steps clockwise: 12th element (since there are only 10 elements, we loop back) is equivalent to the 2nd element (12 mod 10 = 2), which is a gown.\n  - Therefore, the final answer is: gown.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the vestment, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - The vestment is the 4th element on the list.\n  - Moving 10 steps clockwise: 14th element (since there are only 10 elements, we loop back) is equivalent to the 4th element (14 mod 10 = 4), which is the same vestment.\n  - Therefore, the final answer is: vestment."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
