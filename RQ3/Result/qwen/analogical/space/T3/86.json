Let's consider three related problems and their solutions:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the barn, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nThe barn is the 9th element when moving clockwise from the top (banjo). Moving counter-clockwise by 1 step means moving one position backwards. The element before the barn is the Chesapeake Bay Retriever.\n\n**Answer:** Chesapeake Bay Retriever\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the barn, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nThe barn is the 9th element when moving clockwise from the top (banjo). Moving clockwise by 1 step means moving one position forward. The element after the barn is the worm snake.\n\n**Answer:** Worm Snake\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the barn, you first move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction, then move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the barn (9th element), moving counter-clockwise by 1 step brings you to the Chesapeake Bay Retriever.
