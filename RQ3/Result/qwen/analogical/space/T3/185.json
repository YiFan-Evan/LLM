Since there are only 20 positions, \\(30 \\mod 20 = 10\\).\n- Therefore, you end up at the position of a parachute.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the new position obtained in Problem 1, you then move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From the parachute (position 10), moving 2 steps clockwise: \\(10 + 2 = 12\\).\n- Therefore, you end up at the position of a black-footed ferret.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the new position obtained in Problem 2, you then move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From the black-footed ferret (position 12), moving 7 steps counter-clockwise: \\(12 - 7 = 5\\).\n- Therefore, you end up at the position of a tiger cat.\n\n### Final Movement:\nFrom the new position obtained in Problem 3, you then move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From the tiger cat (position 5), moving 14 steps counter-clockwise: \\(5 - 14 = -9\\). Since this is negative, we add 20: \\(-9 + 20 = 11\\).\n- Therefore, you end up at the position of a green iguana.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: green iguana"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
