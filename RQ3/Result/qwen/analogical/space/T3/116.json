You move 1 step counter-clockwise. Which item do you find?\n\nSolution:\n- The items clockwise from the boa constrictor are: gown, wolf spider, saxophone, shopping cart, mud turtle, chime, beer bottle, electric fan, Shih Tzu.\n- Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the gown means moving to the boa constrictor.\n\nTherefore, the item you find is: boa constrictor.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nYou start at the boa constrictor. You move 8 steps clockwise. Which item do you find?\n\nSolution:\n- Starting from the boa constrictor and moving 8 steps clockwise, you will pass through all the items until you reach the electric fan (since 8 steps from the boa constrictor lands you on the electric fan).\n\nTherefore, the item you find is: electric fan.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nYou start at the boa constrictor. You move 8 steps clockwise and then 7 steps clockwise. Which item do you find?\n\nSolution:\n- From the boa constrictor, moving 8 steps clockwise lands you on the electric fan.\n- From the electric fan, moving 7 steps clockwise means you pass through the Shih Tzu, the fan, and land on the gown.\n\nTherefore, the item you find is: gown.\n\nNow, solving the original problem:\n\nStarting from the boa constrictor, you move:\n- 1 step counter-clockwise, landing on the gown.\n- 8 steps clockwise from the gown, landing on the electric fan.\n- 7 steps clockwise from the electric fan, landing on the Shih Tzu.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Shih Tzu."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
