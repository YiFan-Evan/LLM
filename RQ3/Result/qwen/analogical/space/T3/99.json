Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the pretzel, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The sequence starting from the pretzel is: pretzel -> mosquito net.\n- Therefore, moving 1 step clockwise from the pretzel, you will find a mosquito net.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the pretzel, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The sequence starting from the pretzel is: pretzel -> mosquito net -> balance beam.\n- Therefore, moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the pretzel, you will find a balance beam.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the pretzel, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction, then move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- First, moving 1 step clockwise from the pretzel lands you on the mosquito net.\n- Then, moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the mosquito net lands you back on the pretzel.\n- Therefore, after these two moves, you will find a pretzel.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the pretzel, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction, and then you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- First, moving 1 step clockwise from the pretzel lands you on the mosquito net.\n- Then, moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the mosquito net lands you back on the pretzel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: pretzel"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
