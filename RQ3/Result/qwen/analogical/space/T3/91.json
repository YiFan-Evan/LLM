This is because 14 steps clockwise is equivalent to 4 steps clockwise (since the path has 10 elements and 14 mod 10 = 4).\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the cucumber, move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: Starting from the cucumber, which is the 2nd element, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the loupe (the 8th element).\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: loupe"}]
