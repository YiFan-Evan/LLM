Let's break down the problem into three related but not identical scenarios:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the flamingo, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. \n\n- **Solution**: Starting from the flamingo, if we move 8 steps clockwise, we land on the space bar.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the flamingo, you move around the ring by 12 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution**: Starting from the flamingo, if we move 12 steps clockwise, we land on the pirate ship.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the flamingo, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction and then by another 4 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution**: First, moving 8 steps from the flamingo lands us on the space bar. Then, moving an additional 4 steps from the space bar lands us on the confectionery store.\n\nNow, combining both movements from the original problem:\n\n- **First Movement**: Move 8 steps from the flamingo, landing on the space bar.\n- **Second Movement**: Move 12 steps from the space bar. Since there are 20 positions in total, moving 12 steps is equivalent to moving 12 - (20 - 8) = 0 steps from the space bar, which means we stay on the space bar.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: space bar"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
