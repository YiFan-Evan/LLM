Let's define three similar problems with slight variations to understand the process better.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the African rock python, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 1 step in a clockwise direction, and finally by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\n1. Starting position: African rock python.\n2. Move 18 steps clockwise: Starting from the African rock python, moving 18 steps clockwise lands you on the Malinois (since 18 steps clockwise from the African rock python brings you past 17 other items and ends at the Malinois).\n3. Move 1 step clockwise: From the Malinois, moving 1 step clockwise lands you on the sarong.\n4. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: From the sarong, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the Malinois again.\n\nFinal position: Malinois.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the African rock python, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 1 step in a clockwise direction, and finally by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\n1. Starting position: African rock python.\n2. Move 18 steps clockwise: Starting from the African rock python, moving 18 steps clockwise lands you on the Malinois.\n3. Move 1 step clockwise: From the Malinois, moving 1 step clockwise lands you on the sarong.\n4. Move 1 step counter-clockwise: From the sarong, moving 1 step counter-clockwise lands you on the Malinois again.\n\nFinal position: Malinois.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the African rock python, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 1 step in a clockwise direction, and finally by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\n1. Starting position: African rock python.\n2. Move 18 steps clockwise: Starting from the African rock python, moving 18 steps clockwise lands you on the Malinois.\n3. Move 1 step clockwise: From the Malinois, moving 1 step clockwise lands you on the sarong.\n4. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: From the sarong, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the Malinois.\n\nFinal position: Malinois.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nNow, applying the same logic to the original problem:\n\n1. Starting position: African rock python.\n2. Move 18 steps clockwise: Starting from the African rock python, moving 18 steps clockwise lands you on the Malinois.\n3. Move 1 step clockwise: From the Malinois, moving 1 step clockwise lands you on the sarong.\n4. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: From the sarong, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the Malinois.\n5. Move 1 step counter-clockwise: From the Malinois, moving 1 step counter-clockwise lands you on the sarong.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: sarong."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
