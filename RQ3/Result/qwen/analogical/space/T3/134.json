What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The common redshank is the 7th element in the list.\n- Moving 16 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards 16 positions.\n- Since there are 20 elements, moving 16 steps back is equivalent to moving 4 steps forward (20 - 16 = 4).\n- Counting 4 steps forward from the common redshank, you reach the acorn squash.\n\n**Answer:** Acorn squash\n\n### Problem 2:\nAfter reaching the acorn squash, you move around the ring by 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Moving 20 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving all the way around the circle, which brings you back to the starting point.\n- Therefore, you will be back at the common redshank.\n\n**Answer:** Common redshank\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the common redshank, you move around the ring by 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.
