Here are three related problems to illustrate the concept:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the golf ball, move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The elements in order (clockwise from the golf ball): golf ball -> upright piano -> chambered nautilus -> bagel.\n- Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the golf ball lands you on the bagel.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the bagel, move 5 steps clockwise.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The elements in order (clockwise from the bagel): bagel -> golf ball -> upright piano -> chambered nautilus -> Border Collie.\n- Moving 5 steps clockwise from the bagel means moving through all the elements and landing back on the bagel again (since the path is circular).\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the golf ball, move 3 steps counter-clockwise, then move 5 steps clockwise.\n\n**Solution:**\n- First, move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the golf ball, which lands you on the bagel.\n- Then, move 5 steps clockwise from the bagel. Since moving 4 steps lands you back at the golf ball, moving 5 steps lands you on the next element, which is the upright piano.\n\nGiven the original problem:\nStarting from the golf ball, move 3 steps counter-clockwise, and then move 5 steps clockwise.\n\nThe final position after these movements is the upright piano.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: upright piano."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
