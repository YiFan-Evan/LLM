This means you will pass through the beaver, dowitcher, swimming cap, hockey puck, grocery store, and finally land on the candle.\n\n### Sub-Problem 3:\n**Description**: After landing on the candle, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: From the candle, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise, you will effectively move 0 steps counter-clockwise (since 10 modulo 10 is 0). This means you will stay on the candle.\n\nNow, combining all these movements together:\n- Start at the Kuvasz.\n- Move 8 steps clockwise to the scabbard.\n- Move 16 steps counter-clockwise (which is equivalent to 6 steps counter-clockwise) to the candle.\n- Move 10 steps counter-clockwise (which is equivalent to 0 steps counter-clockwise) and stay on the candle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: candle"}]
