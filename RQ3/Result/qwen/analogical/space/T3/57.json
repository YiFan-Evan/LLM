Let's create three related but not identical problems to illustrate different scenarios and solutions.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the paper towel, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: Paper towel.\n- Move 7 steps clockwise: Paper towel -> (1) Crossword -> (2) Sundial -> (3) Crate -> (4) Shoe store -> (5) Snowplow -> (6) Sidewinder -> (7) Monastery.\n- Therefore, the item found is Monastery.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the paper towel, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: Paper towel.\n- Move 10 steps clockwise: Paper towel -> (1) Crossword -> (2) Sundial -> (3) Crate -> (4) Shoe store -> (5) Snowplow -> (6) Sidewinder -> (7) Monastery -> (8) Vault -> (9) Grasshopper -> (10) Paper towel.\n- Therefore, the item found is Paper towel.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the paper towel, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction, then move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.
