Here are three related problems and their solutions:\n\n**Problem 1:** Starting from the academic gown, you move 3 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n- **Solution:** Starting from the academic gown, moving 3 steps clockwise means you will end up at the half-track. Therefore, the item found is the half-track.\n\n**Problem 2:** Starting from the promontory, you move 5 steps counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n- **Solution:** Starting from the promontory, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise means you will end up at the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier. Therefore, the item found is the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\n\n**Problem 3:** Starting from the soccer ball, you move 7 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n- **Solution:** Starting from the soccer ball, moving 7 steps clockwise means you will end up at the knee pad. Therefore, the item found is the knee pad.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the original problem:\n\nStarting from the soccer ball, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction, then 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 4 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n1. **First Movement (Clockwise by 6 steps):**\n   - Soccer ball -> Knee pad -> Banjo -> Jeans -> Promontory -> Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier -> Half-track\n\n   After 6 steps, you are at the half-track.\n\n2. **Second Movement (Counter-Clockwise by 9 steps):**\n   - From the half-track, moving counter-clockwise by 9 steps:\n     - Half-track -> Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier -> Promontory -> Jeans -> Banjo -> Knee pad -> Soccer ball -> Academic gown -> Carousel\n\n   After 9 steps, you are at the carousel.\n\n3. **Third Movement (Clockwise by 4 steps):**\n   - From the carousel, moving clockwise by 4 steps:\n     - Carousel -> Academic gown -> Half-track -> Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier -> Rhinoceros beetle\n\n   After 4 steps, you are at the rhinoceros beetle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: rhinoceros beetle"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
