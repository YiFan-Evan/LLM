So, moving 24 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 4 steps clockwise.\n- **24 steps counter-clockwise:** \\(24 \\mod 20 = 4\\). So, moving 24 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 4 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n### Detailed Steps:\n\n1. **Initial Position:** Monitor.\n2. **Move 4 steps clockwise from the monitor:**\n   - Monitor -> Airship -> Lorikeet -> Mobile Home -> Italian Greyhound.\n   - After 4 steps clockwise, you land on the Italian Greyhound.\n3. **Move 4 steps counter-clockwise from the Italian Greyhound:**\n   - Italian Greyhound -> Mobile Home -> Airship -> Lorikeet -> Monitor.\n   - After 4 steps counter-clockwise, you land back on the Monitor.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: monitor"}]
