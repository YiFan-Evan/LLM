So, the sequence is Ocarina -> Guillotine -> Cucumber -> Swimming Cap -> Measuring Cup -> Broom -> Scabbard -> Trifle -> Indri -> Ocarina -> Ocarina.\n- Therefore, the final position after moving 10 steps clockwise is the Ocarina.\n\nNow, combining these movements:\n- First, move 2 steps counter-clockwise from the Indri to the Scabbard.\n- Then, move 3 steps clockwise from the Scabbard to the Ocarina.\n- Finally, move 10 steps clockwise from the Ocarina, which brings you back to the Ocarina.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Ocarina**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
