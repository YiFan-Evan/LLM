Moving counter-clockwise by 2 steps means moving 8 steps clockwise (since 10 - 2 = 8). The 8th element in the clockwise order is a lionfish.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the lionfish, move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nMoving counter-clockwise by 3 steps from the lionfish means moving 7 steps clockwise (since 8 - 3 = 5, and then 10 - 5 = 5, so the 5th element is the stinkhorn mushroom).\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the stinkhorn mushroom, move around the ring by 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nMoving counter-clockwise by 9 steps from the stinkhorn mushroom means moving 1 step clockwise (since 5 - 9 = -4, and then 10 - 4 = 6, so the 6th element is the Gila monster).\n\nNow, combining all these movements together:\n\n- Start from the academic gown.\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise to reach the lionfish.\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the lionfish to reach the stinkhorn mushroom.\n- Move 9 steps counter-clockwise from the stinkhorn mushroom to reach the Gila monster.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Gila monster."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
