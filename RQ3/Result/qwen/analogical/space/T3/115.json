Here are three related problems:\n\n**Problem 1:** Starting from the mantis, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- Solution: The mantis is the starting point. Moving 6 steps clockwise lands you on the parking meter (since the sequence goes mantis -> pomegranate -> threshing machine -> screw -> loupe -> microphone -> parking meter).\n\n**Problem 2:** Starting from the mantis, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- Solution: The mantis is the starting point. Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise means moving 2 steps forward in the clockwise direction (because the path is circular with 10 dots, and 10 - 8 = 2). This places you on the threshing machine (mantis -> pomegranate -> threshing machine).\n\n**Problem 3:** Starting from the mantis, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- Solution: The mantis is the starting point. Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise means moving 4 steps forward in the clockwise direction (since 10 - 6 = 4). This places you on the loupe (mantis -> pomegranate -> threshing machine -> screw -> loupe).\n\nNow, applying the movements described in the original problem:\n- Starting from the mantis, moving 6 steps clockwise lands you on the parking meter.\n- From the parking meter, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise (since 10 - 8 = 2), landing you on the microphone.\n- From the microphone, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 4 steps clockwise (since 10 - 6 = 4), landing you on the kit fox.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: kit fox"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
