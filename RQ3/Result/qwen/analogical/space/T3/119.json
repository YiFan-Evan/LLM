Here are three related but not identical problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Description**: Starting from the parking meter, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: \n  - Starting position: Parking meter (10th dot).\n  - Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: 10 - 3 = 7 (7th dot, which is a flagpole).\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: Starting from the flagpole, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: \n  - Starting position: Flagpole (7th dot).\n  - Move 9 steps clockwise: 7 + 9 = 16. Since there are only 10 dots, 16 mod 10 = 6 (6th dot, which is a clothes iron).\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: Starting from the clothes iron, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: \n  - Starting position: Clothes iron (6th dot).\n  - Move 1 step clockwise: 6 + 1 = 7 (7th dot, which is a flagpole).\n\nNow, combining all these movements together:\n- Start at the parking meter (10th dot).\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: 10 - 3 = 7 (flagpole).\n- Move 9 steps clockwise from the flagpole: 7 + 9 = 16 mod 10 = 6 (clothes iron).\n- Move 1 step clockwise from the clothes iron: 6 + 1 = 7 (flagpole).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: flagpole"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
