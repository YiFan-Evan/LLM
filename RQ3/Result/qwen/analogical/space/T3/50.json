What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The pencil case is the 6th element clockwise from the top.\n- Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means moving 3 steps backwards from the pencil case.\n- Counting backwards, we have:\n  - 5th element: reflex camera\n  - 4th element: broccoli\n  - 3rd element: waffle iron\n\nSo, after moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the pencil case, you find a **waffle iron**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou are positioned at the reflex camera (the 5th element clockwise from the top) and move 10 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the reflex camera, moving 10 steps clockwise means completing one full circle (10 steps) plus an additional step.\n- After 10 steps, you end up at the same position as moving 1 step forward from the reflex camera.\n- The next element is the broccoli.\n\nSo, after moving 10 steps clockwise from the reflex camera, you find a **broccoli**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou are positioned at the pencil case and move 10 steps clockwise.

Move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the pencil case:\n   - You land on the **waffle iron** (as calculated in Problem 1).\n\n2. From the waffle iron, move 10 steps clockwise:\n   - Completing a full circle brings you back to the waffle iron, and another step takes you to the washing machine.\n\nSo, after moving 3 steps counter-clockwise and then 10 steps clockwise from the pencil case, you find a **washing machine**.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: washing machine.**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
