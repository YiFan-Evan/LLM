What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Wild boar.\n- Moving 3 steps clockwise: Wild boar -> Trombone -> Hot dog -> Necklace.\n- Therefore, the final position after 3 steps is the necklace.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the wild boar, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Wild boar.\n- Moving 5 steps clockwise: Wild boar -> Trombone -> Hot dog -> Necklace -> Bell pepper -> Hot dog.\n- Since the path is circular, moving 5 steps is equivalent to moving 0 steps (or staying at the same position due to the circular nature), which brings you back to the hot dog.\n- Therefore, the final position after 5 steps is the hot dog.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the wild boar, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- First movement: From wild boar to hot dog (as calculated in Problem 1).\n- Second movement: From hot dog to bell pepper (since moving 5 steps from hot dog brings you back to hot dog, and another step takes you to bell pepper).\n- Therefore, the final position after both movements is the bell pepper.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: bell pepper."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.

What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Wild boar.\n- Moving 6 steps clockwise: Wild boar -> Trombone -> Hot dog -> Necklace -> Bell pepper -> Wild boar -> Trombone.\n- Since the path is circular, moving 6 steps is equivalent to moving 1 step (6 mod 5 = 1), which brings you to the trombone.\n- Therefore, the final position after 6 steps is the trombone.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the wild boar, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.
