Here are three related problems:\n\n1. **Problem**: You are positioned on the dot where a stretcher is located at the start. Moving in a clockwise direction, the next element is a hartebeest. If you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction starting from the stretcher, what will you find?\n   - **Solution**: Starting from the stretcher (top), moving 4 steps clockwise, you will pass through the hartebeest, Saluki, and necklace before reaching the gong. Therefore, the item found is the gong.\n\n2. **Problem**: You are positioned on the dot where the Saluki is located. Moving in a clockwise direction, the next element is a necklace. If you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction starting from the Saluki, what will you find?\n   - **Solution**: Starting from the Saluki, moving 3 steps clockwise, you will pass through the necklace and gong before reaching the stretcher. Therefore, the item found is the stretcher.\n\n3. **Problem**: You are positioned on the dot where the necklace is located. Moving in a counterclockwise direction, the previous element is a hartebeest.

What will you find?\n- **Solution**: Starting from the Saluki, moving 10 steps clockwise, you will pass through the necklace and gong, complete one full circle, and then pass through the stretcher and hartebeest. This brings you back to the necklace. Therefore, the item found is the necklace.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: necklace"}]
