We'll break down the problem into simpler parts and then combine them to get the final answer.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the shoe store, you move around the ring by 19 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The circular path has 20 dots.\n- Moving 19 steps counter-clockwise from the shoe store (which is the 13th dot) means you move to the opposite side of the circle.\n- 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (since 20 - 19 = 1).\n- Therefore, you end up on the dot immediately clockwise from the shoe store, which is the water buffalo (the 14th dot).\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the water buffalo, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the water buffalo (14th dot), moving 10 steps clockwise means you move past the next 10 dots.\n- 14 + 10 = 24, but since the path is circular and has only 20 dots, we take the remainder when divided by 20.\n- 24 % 20 = 4.\n- Therefore, you end up on the 4th dot, which is a goose.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the goose, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the goose (4th dot), moving 9 steps clockwise means you move past the next 9 dots.\n- 4 + 9 = 13.\n- Therefore, you end up on the 13th dot, which is a shoe store.\n\n### Combining All Movements:\n- From the shoe store, you moved 19 steps counter-clockwise to reach the water buffalo.\n- Then, from the water buffalo, you moved 10 steps clockwise to reach the goose.\n- Finally, from the goose, you moved 9 steps clockwise to reach the shoe store.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: shoe store"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
