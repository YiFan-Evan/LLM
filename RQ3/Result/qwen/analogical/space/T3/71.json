We'll break it down into several steps and provide examples for clarity.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Description:** You start at the dog sled and move 9 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** The circular path has 10 positions. Moving 9 steps counter-clockwise from the dog sled (starting point), you end up at the barn. Therefore, the item found is the barn.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** From the barn, you move 2 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the barn lands you at the red-breasted merganser. Therefore, the item found is the red-breasted merganser.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** From the red-breasted merganser, you move 2 steps clockwise.\n- **Solution:** Moving 2 steps clockwise from the red-breasted merganser brings you to the promontory. Therefore, the item found is the promontory.\n\nNow, combining all the movements described in the original problem:\n\n1. Starting at the dog sled, move 9 steps counter-clockwise (landed on the barn).\n2. From the barn, move 2 steps counter-clockwise (landed on the red-breasted merganser).\n3. From the red-breasted merganser, move 2 steps clockwise (landed on the promontory).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: promontory"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.

Starting from the dog sled, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise lands you at the Asian elephant. Therefore, the item found is the Asian elephant.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** From the Asian elephant, you move 4 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the Asian elephant lands you at the spotted salamander. Therefore, the item found is the spotted salamander.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** From the spotted salamander, you move 4 steps clockwise.\n- **Solution:** Moving 4 steps clockwise from the spotted salamander brings you to the church. Therefore, the item found is the church.\n\nCombining all the movements described in the original problem:\n\n1.
