Here are three related but not identical problems:\n\n1. **Problem 1**: Starting from the Arctic fox, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n   - **Solution**: Starting from the Arctic fox and moving 5 steps clockwise, the sequence of items encountered would be Arctic fox \u2192 Cairn Terrier \u2192 envelope \u2192 red king crab \u2192 dung beetle. Therefore, after 5 steps, you will find a dung beetle.\n\n2. **Problem 2**: Starting from the Arctic fox, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n   - **Solution**: Starting from the Arctic fox and moving 15 steps clockwise, the sequence of items encountered would be Arctic fox \u2192 Arctic fox (after 20 steps, it loops back to Arctic fox) \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 barn. Since 15 steps take you past the Arctic fox but before the barn, you will find a barn.\n\n3. **Problem 3**: Starting from the Arctic fox, you move around the ring by 30 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n   - **Solution**: Starting from the Arctic fox and moving 30 steps clockwise, the sequence of items encountered would loop twice around the ring. Since 30 steps is equivalent to 10 steps within one full circle (30 mod 20 = 10), you will end up 10 steps past the Arctic fox. The sequence is Arctic fox \u2192 \u2026 \u2192 recreational vehicle. Therefore, after 30 steps, you will find a recreational vehicle.\n\nNow, solving the original problem:\n- Starting from the Arctic fox and moving 20 steps clockwise, you will end up exactly one full circle later, back at the Arctic fox.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: Arctic fox**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
