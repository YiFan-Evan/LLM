Grey whale\n2. Lens cap\n3. Bikini\n4. Solar thermal collector\n5. Overskirt\n6. Notebook computer\n7. Paddle\n8. Horse-drawn vehicle\n9. Ladle\n10. Collie\n\nMoving 1 step clockwise from the grey whale lands you on the lens cap.\n\n**Answer:** Lens cap\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the grey whale, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the grey whale, moving 3 steps clockwise, the sequence is:\n1. Grey whale\n2. Lens cap\n3. Bikini\n4.
