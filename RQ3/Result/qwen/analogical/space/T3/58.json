Move 4 steps clockwise:\n   - From position 9 to position 1 (Ptarmigan).\n\n2. Move 10 steps clockwise:\n   - Since the path has 10 dots, moving 10 steps is equivalent to completing one full circle, so we return to the starting point at position 1 (Ptarmigan).\n\n3. Move 12 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Moving 12 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise (since 12 mod 10 = 2).\n   - From position 1 to position 3 (Green Iguana).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Green Iguana"}]
