What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the altar (position 4), moving 2 steps clockwise, you reach position 6.\n- The element at position 6 is a badger.\n- Therefore, the item found after moving 2 steps clockwise from the altar is a badger.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the badger (position 6), you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction and then by 2 steps in a clockwise direction.
