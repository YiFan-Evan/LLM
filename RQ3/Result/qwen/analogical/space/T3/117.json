Then, you move 2 steps counter-clockwise, and finally, you move 4 steps clockwise.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Reflex camera.\n- Move 12 steps clockwise: Since the path has 10 dots, moving 12 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise (because 12 mod 10 = 2), so you reach the ice cream.\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: You go back to the reflex camera.\n- Move 4 steps clockwise: You reach the vacuum cleaner.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: vacuum cleaner.\n\n### Problem 2\n**Description:** \nYou start at the reflex camera and move 10 steps clockwise.
