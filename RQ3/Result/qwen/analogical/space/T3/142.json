Let's break down each step:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the trimaran, you move around the ring by 16 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The trimaran is at position 15.\n- Moving 16 steps counter-clockwise from position 15, we get to position \\(15 - 16 = -1\\). \n- Since the path is circular with 20 positions, we need to take \\(-1 \\mod 20 = 19\\).\n- The item at position 19 is a paper knife.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the new position (paper knife), you move around the ring by 24 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from position 19, moving 24 steps clockwise means moving \\(19 + 24 = 43\\).\n- Since the path is circular with 20 positions, we need to take \\(43 \\mod 20 = 3\\).\n- The item at position 3 is an Australian Kelpie.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the new position (Australian Kelpie), you move around the ring by 34 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from position 3, moving 34 steps clockwise means moving \\(3 + 34 = 37\\).\n- Since the path is circular with 20 positions, we need to take \\(37 \\mod 20 = 17\\).\n- The item at position 17 is a cougar.\n\n### Final Problem:\nFrom the new position (cougar), you move around the ring by 26 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from position 17, moving 26 steps counter-clockwise means moving \\(17 - 26 = -9\\).\n- Since the path is circular with 20 positions, we need to take \\(-9 \\mod 20 = 11\\).\n- The item at position 11 is a mashed potato.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: mashed potato"}]
