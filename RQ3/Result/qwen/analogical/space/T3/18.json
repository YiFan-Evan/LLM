Here are three such problems:\n\n1. **Problem 1:** You start at the pickup truck and move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n   - **Solution:** If you start at the pickup truck and move 1 step clockwise, you will reach the bathtub.\n\n2. **Problem 2:** You start at the pickup truck and move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction.
