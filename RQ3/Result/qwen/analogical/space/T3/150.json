What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. The lion is the 13th element (counting from the top).\n2. Moving 17 steps counter-clockwise means moving 17 steps backwards.\n3. Since there are only 20 dots, moving 17 steps backwards is equivalent to moving 3 steps forward (20 - 17 = 3).\n4. Starting from the 13th dot and moving 3 steps forward lands us on the 16th dot.\n5. The 16th dot contains a barometer.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the lion, move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Then move 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Starting from the lion (13th dot), move 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n2. This is equivalent to moving 12 steps forward (20 - 8 = 12).\n3. Starting from the 13th dot and moving 12 steps forward lands us on the 5th dot.\n4. From the 5th dot, move 8 steps clockwise.\n5.
