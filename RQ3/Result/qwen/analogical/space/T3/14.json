What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The path consists of 5 elements: notebook computer, holster, cricket, cocktail shaker, and garbage truck.\n- Moving 5 steps clockwise means you will complete one full circle and end up back at the notebook computer.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: notebook computer\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the holster, which is the second element in the clockwise direction, you move 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the holster, moving 3 steps clockwise would take you past the cricket and the cocktail shaker, landing you on the garbage truck.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: garbage truck\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the notebook computer, you move 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the notebook computer and moving 2 steps counter-clockwise, you would pass the garbage truck and land on the cocktail shaker.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: cocktail shaker\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the holster, you move 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The path is circular, so moving 5 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 0 steps (since 5 steps counter-clockwise is a full circle).\n- Starting from the holster and moving 5 steps counter-clockwise lands you back at the holster.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: holster"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
