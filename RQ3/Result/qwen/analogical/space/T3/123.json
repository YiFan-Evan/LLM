Which item do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The snail is at position 18 (assuming positions are numbered from 0 to 19 starting from the top).\n- Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from position 18 lands you at position 13.\n- Position 13 contains a newt.\n  \nSo, the item found is a newt.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting again at the snail, you move 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction and then 11 more steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Which item do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- From the snail (position 18), moving 5 steps counter-clockwise lands you at position 13 (newt).\n- Moving 11 more steps counter-clockwise from position 13 lands you at position 6.\n- Position 6 contains a cauliflower.\n\nSo, the item found is a cauliflower.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting again at the snail, you move 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 11 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 4 more steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Which item do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- From the snail (position 18), moving 5 steps counter-clockwise lands you at position 13 (newt).\n- Moving 11 more steps counter-clockwise from position 13 lands you at position 6 (cauliflower).\n- Moving 4 more steps counter-clockwise from position 6 lands you at position 2.\n- Position 2 contains a Ladle.\n\nSo, the item found is a ladle.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: ladle."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
