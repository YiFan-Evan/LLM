Where do you end up?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The vase is at position 6 (if we number the positions starting from 0 at the church).\n- Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from position 6 lands you at position 5.\n- Position 5 corresponds to the junco.\n\nTherefore, after moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the vase, you find a junco.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the vase, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Where do you end up?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The vase is at position 6.\n- Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from position 6 lands you at position 2.\n- Position 2 corresponds to the black-and-white colobus.\n\nTherefore, after moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the vase, you find a black-and-white colobus.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the vase, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Where do you end up?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The vase is at position 6.\n- Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from position 6 lands you at position 1.\n- Position 1 corresponds to the payphone.\n\nTherefore, after moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the vase, you find a payphone.\n\nNow, combining all the movements:\n\n- First, you move 1 step counter-clockwise from the vase, landing at the junco.\n- Then, you move 4 steps counter-clockwise from the junco, landing at the black-and-white colobus.\n- Finally, you move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the black-and-white colobus, landing at the payphone.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: payphone."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
