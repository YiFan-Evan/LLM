Therefore, after moving 9 steps counter-clockwise from the snow leopard, you will find a leafhopper.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the leafhopper, move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: The sequence of elements starting from the leafhopper (moving clockwise) would be: orange, Standard Poodle, gibbon. Therefore, after moving 3 steps clockwise from the leafhopper, you will find a gibbon.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the gibbon, move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: The sequence of elements starting from the gibbon (moving counter-clockwise) would be: waste container, chiton, hornbill, siamang, website, soup bowl, great grey owl. Therefore, after moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from the gibbon, you will find a great grey owl.\n\nNow, we combine all these movements:\n\n1. Move 9 steps counter-clockwise from the snow leopard: you land on the leafhopper.\n2. Move 3 steps clockwise from the leafhopper: you land on the gibbon.\n3. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise from the gibbon: you land on the great grey owl.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: great grey owl."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
