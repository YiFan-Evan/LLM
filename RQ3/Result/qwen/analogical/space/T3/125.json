What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the house finch (top), moving 8 steps clockwise lands you on the manhole cover.\n\n**Answer:** manhole cover\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the manhole cover, you move 15 steps counterclockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom the manhole cover, moving 15 steps counterclockwise brings you back to the house finch.\n\n**Answer:** house finch\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the house finch, you move 6 steps counterclockwise, then 3 more steps counterclockwise.
