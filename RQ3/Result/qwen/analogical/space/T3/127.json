Here are three related problems to illustrate different aspects of the movement:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the traffic light, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The traffic light is the last element on the list.\n- Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards through the list.\n- Starting from the traffic light (20th element), moving 7 steps back lands us on the 13th element, which is a black-and-white colobus.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the black-and-white colobus, you move around the ring by 16 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the black-and-white colobus (13th element), moving 16 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards through the list.\n- Moving 16 steps back from the 13th element lands us on the 11th element (since 13 - 16 = -3, and -3 mod 20 = 17, so we land on the 17th element).\n- The 17th element is a quilt.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the quilt, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 6 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the quilt (17th element), moving 1 step counter-clockwise lands us on the 16th element (a ping-pong ball).\n- Then, moving 6 steps clockwise from the 16th element lands us on the 10th element (since 16 + 6 = 22, and 22 mod 20 = 2, so we land on the 10th element).\n- The 10th element is a diaper.\n\nNow, combining all the movements:\n\n1. Start at the traffic light (20th element).\n2. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise: 20 - 7 = 13 (black-and-white colobus).\n3. Move 16 steps counter-clockwise: 13 - 16 = -3, which is equivalent to 17 (quilt).\n4. Move 1 step counter-clockwise: 17 - 1 = 16 (ping-pong ball).\n5. Move 6 steps clockwise: 16 + 6 = 22, which is equivalent to 2 (bolo tie).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: bolo tie."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Start at the traffic light (20th element).\n2. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise: 20 - 14 = 6 (Sealyham Terrier).\n3. Move 32 steps counter-clockwise: 6 - 32 = -26, which is equivalent to 14 (spiny lobster).\n4. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: 14 - 2 = 12 (stupa).\n5. Move 12 steps clockwise: 12 + 12 = 24, which is equivalent to 4 (spiny lobster).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: spiny lobster."}]
