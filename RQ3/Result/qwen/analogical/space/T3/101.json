So, you remain at the neck brace.\n\n**Solution:** Neck brace\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the neck brace, move 8 steps clockwise.\n\n- Moving 8 steps clockwise from the neck brace means moving past wool, quail, alligator lizard, hippopotamus, analog clock, front curtain, and Band-Aid, landing on the ballpoint pen.\n\n**Solution:** Ballpoint pen\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the ballpoint pen, move 12 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n- Moving 12 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps counter-clockwise (since 12 mod 10 = 2). Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the ballpoint pen lands you on the Band-Aid.\n\n**Solution:** Band-Aid\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the neck brace, move 10 steps counter-clockwise, then 8 steps clockwise, and finally 12 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n1.
