Here are three related problems:\n\n**Problem 1:**  \n- **Description:** Starting from the Saluki, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** After moving 9 steps clockwise from the Saluki (which is at position 1), you end up at the position of the \"bollard\" (since the positions are counted as 1-based, the 10th element is a bollard). But since the provided sequence does not contain a bollard, let's correct it to the actual element at position 10, which is a \"toilet paper\". Therefore, the final answer for Problem 1 is: toilet paper.\n\n**Problem 2:**  \n- **Description:** Starting from the Saluki, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** First, moving 9 steps from the Saluki lands you at the toilet paper (position 10). Then, moving 10 more steps from there brings you to the position of the \"bittern\" (position 20). Therefore, the final answer for Problem 2 is: bittern.\n\n**Problem 3:**  \n- **Description:** Starting from the Saluki, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 11 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** First, moving 9 steps from the Saluki lands you at the toilet paper (position 10). Then, moving 10 more steps from there brings you to the bittern (position 20). Finally, moving 11 more steps from the bittern brings you back to the position of the \"chain\" (position 17). Therefore, the final answer for Problem 3 is: chain.\n\nNow, applying the same logic to the original problem:\n\nStarting from the Saluki, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 11 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally by 2 steps in a clockwise direction. \n\nFirst, moving 9 steps from the Saluki lands you at the toilet paper (position 10).
