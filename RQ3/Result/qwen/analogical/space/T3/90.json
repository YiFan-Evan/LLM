Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and create related problems.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the sunscreen, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the sunscreen (dot 10).\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: You move to dot 8 (sulphur butterfly).\n- Then move 5 steps clockwise: You move to dot 3 (lipstick).\n\nSo, the item found is the lipstick.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the lipstick, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the lipstick (dot 3).\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: You move to dot 1 (paddle wheel).\n- Then move 5 steps clockwise: You move to dot 6 (crayfish).\n\nSo, the item found is the crayfish.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the crayfish, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the crayfish (dot 6).\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: You move to dot 4 (convertible).\n- Then move 5 steps clockwise: You move to dot 9 (sunscreen).\n\nSo, the item found is the sunscreen.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nNow, let's solve the original problem step-by-step:\n\n- Starting from the sunscreen (dot 10).\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: You move to dot 8 (sulphur butterfly).\n- Then move 5 steps clockwise: You move to dot 3 (lipstick).\n- Then move 2 steps clockwise: You move to dot 5 (trolleybus).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: trolleybus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
