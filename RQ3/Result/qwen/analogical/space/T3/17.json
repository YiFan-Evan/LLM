What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The sequence starting from the square academic cap (starting point) moving clockwise: \n  - Step 1: Remote control.\n  - Step 2: Ocean liner.\n\nSo, after moving 2 steps, you will find an **ocean liner**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the square academic cap, move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The sequence starting from the square academic cap (starting point) moving clockwise:\n  - Step 1: Remote control.\n  - Step 2: Ocean liner.\n  - Step 3: Fox squirrel.\n\nSo, after moving 3 steps, you will find a **fox squirrel**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the square academic cap, move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The sequence starting from the square academic cap (starting point) moving clockwise:\n  - Step 1: Remote control.\n  - Step 2: Ocean liner.\n  - Step 3: Fox squirrel.\n  - Step 4: Bassinet.\n\nSo, after moving 4 steps, you will find a **bassinet**.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the square academic cap, move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Since there are only 5 positions in total and we are moving 5 steps, it means we complete one full cycle and end up back at the starting point.\n- Therefore, after moving 5 steps, you will find the item at the starting point, which is a **square academic cap**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **square academic cap**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
