Start from the apiary (16th dot).\n2. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise: 16th dot - 6 steps = 10th dot (snail).\n3. Move 10 steps clockwise: 10th dot + 10 steps = 20th dot (jackfruit).\n4. Move 9 steps counter-clockwise: 20th dot - 9 steps = 11th dot (amphibious vehicle).\n5. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise: 11th dot - 7 steps = 4th dot (spaghetti squash).\n\n**Final Solution:** Therefore, the final answer is: Spaghetti squash"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
