You move 3 steps counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n- **Solution**: Starting from the library (top), moving 3 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the scorpion.\n- **Answer**: Scorpion\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: You are now at the scorpion. From there, you move 5 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n- **Solution**: Starting from the scorpion, moving 5 steps clockwise involves completing one full circle (5 steps) and landing back at the scorpion.\n- **Answer**: Scorpion\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: You are at the library (top). You move 3 steps counter-clockwise and then 5 steps clockwise. Where do you end up?\n- **Solution**: Starting from the library, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the scorpion. Then, moving 5 steps clockwise from the scorpion completes one full circle and lands you back at the scorpion.\n- **Answer**: Scorpion\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the scorpion, you move 3 steps counter-clockwise, landing you at the gas pump.
