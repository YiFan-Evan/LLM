Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: The bow (16th dot from the top).\n\n2. **First Movement**: Move 30 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Since the path has 20 dots, moving 30 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(30 \\mod 20 = 10\\) steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Starting at the 16th dot, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise places you at the 6th dot (scorpion).\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 32 steps clockwise.\n   - Moving 32 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(32 \\mod 20 = 12\\) steps clockwise.\n   - Starting at the 6th dot, moving 12 steps clockwise places you at the 18th dot (American bullfrog).\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 18 steps clockwise.\n   - Moving 18 steps clockwise places you at the \\(18 + 18 = 36\\)th dot.\n   - Since there are 20 dots, \\(36 \\mod 20 = 16\\). Thus, you end up at the 16th dot (bow).\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Move 12 steps clockwise.\n   - Moving 12 steps clockwise from the 16th dot places you at the \\(16 + 12 = 28\\)th dot.\n   - Since there are 20 dots, \\(28 \\mod 20 = 8\\).
