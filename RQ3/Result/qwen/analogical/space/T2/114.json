Therefore, after moving 3 steps clockwise from the oystercatcher, you would find a purse.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the oystercatcher, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: The oystercatcher is preceded by a station wagon (1 step), a syringe (2 steps), a Papillon (3 steps), a pencil case (4 steps), a purse (5 steps), a Clumber Spaniel (6 steps), a half-track (7 steps), and finally a shower curtain (8 steps). Therefore, after moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the oystercatcher, you would find a shower curtain.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the oystercatcher, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, and then by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: First, moving 3 steps clockwise from the oystercatcher brings you to the purse. Then, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the purse, you go through the Clumber Spaniel (1 step), the half-track (2 steps), the shower curtain (3 steps), the syringe (4 steps), the Papillon (5 steps), the pencil case (6 steps), the station wagon (7 steps), and back to the oystercatcher (8 steps).
