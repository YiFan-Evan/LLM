What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- From the tiger beetle (position 13), moving 17 steps clockwise:\n  - Tiger beetle (13) -> Overskirt (14) -> Parachute (15) -> Dowitcher (16) -> Black-footed Ferret (17) -> Tiger Beetle (18) -> Beagle (19) -> Killer Whale (20) -> Granny Smith (1) -> Bedlington Terrier (2) -> Stick Insect (3) -> Green Iguana (4) -> Samoyed (5) -> Partridge (6) -> Black and Tan Coonhound (7) -> Tank (8) -> Windsor Tie (9).\n  \n- Therefore, after 17 steps, you find a **Windsor Tie**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the tiger beetle, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- From the tiger beetle (position 13), moving 2 steps clockwise:\n  - Tiger beetle (13) -> Beagle (14) -> Killer Whale (15).\n  \n- Therefore, after 2 steps, you find a **Killer Whale**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the tiger beetle, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- From the tiger beetle (position 13), moving 7 steps counter-clockwise:\n  - Tiger beetle (13) -> Green Iguana (12) -> Stick Insect (11) -> Samoyed (10) -> Granny Smith (9) -> Bedlington Terrier (8) -> Stick Insect (7) -> Tiger Beetle (6).\n\n- Therefore, after 7 steps, you find a **Tiger Beetle**.\n\n### Final Calculation:\nNow we combine all movements:\n\n1. Move 17 steps clockwise: Find a **Windsor Tie**.\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise: From the Windsor Tie, moving 2 steps clockwise lands on a **Parade Uniform** (since the path wraps around, the next step after Samoyed is Partridge, then Black and Tan Coonhound, then Tank, then Windsor Tie, then Parade Uniform).\n3. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise: From the Parade Uniform, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise lands on a **Gas Mask**.\n4. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise: From the Gas Mask, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise lands on a **Dowitcher**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Dowitcher**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
