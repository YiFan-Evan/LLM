Where do you end up?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting at the conch, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise, you pass through the cabbage, the odometer, the dog sled, the worm snake, and the kit fox before reaching the hot pot. Therefore, after moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the conch, you end up at the hot pot.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the hot pot, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction. Where do you end up?\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom the hot pot, moving 1 step clockwise, you reach the Asian elephant. Therefore, after moving 1 step clockwise from the hot pot, you end up at the Asian elephant.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the Asian elephant, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction. Where do you end up?\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom the Asian elephant, moving 2 steps clockwise, you pass through the hot pot and reach the kit fox. Therefore, after moving 2 steps clockwise from the Asian elephant, you end up at the kit fox.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the conch, you first move 6 steps counter-clockwise to the hot pot, then 1 step clockwise to the Asian elephant, and finally 2 steps clockwise to the kit fox.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **kit fox**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
