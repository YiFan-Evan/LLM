What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Breakwater is the 7th element.\n- Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from the breakwater means moving back 7 positions.\n- The 7th element from the end (or 14th element from the start) is a tray.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: tray\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the breakwater, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Breakwater is the 7th element.\n- Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from the breakwater brings you to the tray.\n- Moving 10 more steps counter-clockwise from the tray means moving back 10 positions.\n- The 10th element from the end (or 11th element from the start) is a dust jacket.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: dust jacket\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the breakwater, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Breakwater is the 7th element.\n- Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from the breakwater brings you to the tray.\n- Moving 10 more steps counter-clockwise from the tray brings you to the dust jacket.\n- Moving 18 more steps counter-clockwise from the dust jacket means moving back 18 positions.\n- The 18th element from the end (or 3rd element from the start) is a spindle.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: spindle\n\nNow, let's combine all the movements in the original problem:\n\n- Starting from the breakwater (7th element).\n- Move 7 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the tray (3rd element).\n- Move 10 steps counter-clockwise from the tray: you reach the dust jacket (11th element).\n- Move 18 steps counter-clockwise from the dust jacket: you reach the spindle (3rd element).\n- Move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the spindle: you reach the carton (2nd element).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: carton"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
