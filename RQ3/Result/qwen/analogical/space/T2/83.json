Let's consider three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the gown, move 3 steps clockwise.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The items starting from the gown and moving clockwise are: orange, table lamp, suspension bridge.\n- After 3 steps clockwise from the gown, you will be at the suspension bridge.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the gown, move 5 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The items starting from the gown and moving counter-clockwise are: traffic light, computer mouse, cliff dwelling, green mamba, television.\n- After 5 steps counter-clockwise from the gown, you will be at the television.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the gown, move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The items starting from the gown and moving counter-clockwise are: traffic light, computer mouse, cliff dwelling.\n- After 3 steps counter-clockwise from the gown, you will be at the cliff dwelling.\n\nNow, combining all the movements:\n1. Move 3 steps clockwise from the gown: Suspension bridge.\n2. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the suspension bridge: Table lamp (since moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the suspension bridge brings you back to the table lamp).\n3. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the table lamp: Cliff dwelling.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: cliff dwelling."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
