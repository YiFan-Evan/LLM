Here are three related but not identical problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Description:** Starting from the academic gown, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n**Solution:** The academic gown is the 10th element in the list. Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards by 2 positions. So, starting from the academic gown (10th), moving 2 steps back, you land on the Gila monster (8th).\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** From the Gila monster, you then move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n**Solution:** The Gila monster is the 7th element in the list. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards by 3 positions. So, starting from the Gila monster (7th), moving 3 steps back, you land on the lionfish (5th).\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** From the lionfish, you then move around the ring by 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n**Solution:** The lionfish is the 6th element in the list. Moving 9 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards by 9 positions. Since the path is circular with 10 elements, moving 9 steps back is equivalent to moving 1 step forward (because 10 - 9 = 1). So, starting from the lionfish (6th), moving 9 steps back, you land on the torch (4th).\n\nNow, let's put all these movements together:\n- Start at the academic gown (10th).\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: land on the Gila monster (8th).\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: land on the lionfish (6th).\n- Move 9 steps counter-clockwise: land on the torch (4th).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: torch"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
