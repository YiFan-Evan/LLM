Therefore, after moving two steps clockwise from the paintbrush, you will find a mongoose.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the new position after the first movement (mongoose), you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution:** Starting from the mongoose and moving seven steps counter-clockwise, the sequence is mongoose -> paintbrush -> Labrador Retriever -> waffle iron -> jeep -> ice pop -> ear -> Border Collie. Thus, after moving seven steps counter-clockwise from the mongoose, you will find a Border Collie.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the new position after the second movement (Border Collie), you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution:** Starting from the Border Collie and moving five steps counter-clockwise, the sequence is Border Collie -> ear -> mongoose -> paintbrush -> screw -> Border Collie. Therefore, after moving five steps counter-clockwise from the Border Collie, you will find a screw.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: screw"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
