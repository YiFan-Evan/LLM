Let's create three related but not identical problems to illustrate the process:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the maze, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Maze (bottom of the circular path)\n- Movement: 1 step clockwise\n- Path sequence (clockwise): Yorkshire Terrier \u2192 Gong \u2192 Shovel \u2192 Paddle \u2192 Maze\n- After moving 1 step clockwise from the maze, you reach the Yorkshire Terrier.\n\n**Answer:** Yorkshire Terrier\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Yorkshire Terrier, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Yorkshire Terrier (top of the circular path)\n- Movement: 2 steps counter-clockwise\n- Path sequence (counter-clockwise): Maze \u2192 Paddle \u2192 Shovel \u2192 Gong \u2192 Yorkshire Terrier\n- After moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the Yorkshire Terrier, you reach the Shovel.\n\n**Answer:** Shovel\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the maze, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction, then by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Maze (bottom of the circular path)\n- First Movement: 1 step clockwise\n  - From the maze, moving 1 step clockwise lands you on the Yorkshire Terrier.\n- Second Movement: 2 steps counter-clockwise\n  - From the Yorkshire Terrier, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the Shovel.\n\n**Answer:** Shovel\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: Shovel"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
