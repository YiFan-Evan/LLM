Therefore, after moving 10 steps clockwise from the ox, you find an ox.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the paper towel, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - First, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the paper towel lands you on the ox.\n  - Next, moving 10 steps clockwise from the ox lands you back on the ox.\n\nSo, after these movements, you find an ox.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: ox"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
