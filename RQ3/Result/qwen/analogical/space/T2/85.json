Counting clockwise from the jack-o'-lantern, we get:\n1. Jack-o'-lantern\n2. Cuirass\n3. Hook\n4. Ostrich\n5. Southern black widow\n6. Chimpanzee\n7.

Jack-o'-lantern\n2. Cuirass\n\nSo, after moving 2 steps clockwise from the jack-o'-lantern, you will find a **cuirass**.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nNow, combining all the movements specified in the original problem (7 steps, then 9 steps, then 2 steps):\n\n1.
