Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the traffic light, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The traffic light is the 20th element.\n- Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from the traffic light, you reach the 13th element (20 - 7 = 13).\n- The 13th element is a black-and-white colobus.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the black-and-white colobus, you move around the ring by 16 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The black-and-white colobus is the 13th element.\n- Moving 16 steps counter-clockwise from the black-and-white colobus, you reach the 11th element (13 - 16 = -3, and since it's a circular path, -3 + 20 = 17).\n- The 17th element is a quilt.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the quilt, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The quilt is the 17th element.\n- Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the quilt, you reach the 16th element (17 - 1 = 16).\n- The 16th element is a ping-pong ball.\n\nNow, combining all these movements together:\n\n- Starting from the traffic light (20th element), moving 7 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the black-and-white colobus (13th element).\n- From the black-and-white colobus (13th element), moving 16 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the quilt (17th element).\n- From the quilt (17th element), moving 1 step counter-clockwise lands you on the ping-pong ball (16th element).\n- Finally, moving 6 steps clockwise from the ping-pong ball (16th element) lands you on the dog sled (10th element).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: dog sled."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
