What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nThe King Charles Spaniel is the 12th element on the list. Moving 15 steps clockwise means moving past 15 elements. Since there are 20 elements in total, we can calculate the new position using modulo arithmetic:\n\\[ 12 + 15 \\equiv 27 \\pmod{20} \\]\n\\[ 27 - 20 = 7 \\]\nSo, after moving 15 steps clockwise from the King Charles Spaniel, you land on the 7th element, which is a gazelle.\n\n### Problem 2:\nNow, starting from the gazelle (which is the 7th element), you move around the ring by 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nMoving 15 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards through the list. Using modulo arithmetic again:\n\\[ 7 - 15 \\equiv -8 \\pmod{20} \\]\nSince positions are positive, we convert \\(-8\\) to a positive index:\n\\[ -8 + 20 = 12 \\]\nSo, after moving 15 steps counter-clockwise from the gazelle, you land on the 12th element, which is the King Charles Spaniel.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFinally, starting from the King Charles Spaniel, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction and then by 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom the King Charles Spaniel (12th element), moving 15 steps clockwise lands you on the gazelle (7th element). From the gazelle (7th element), moving 15 steps counter-clockwise brings you back to the King Charles Spaniel (12th element).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: King Charles Spaniel"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
