Let's consider three related problems to illustrate the process.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the padlock, move 13 steps clockwise.\n- The padlock is the 20th element.\n- Moving 13 steps clockwise from the padlock lands us on the 6th element (since 20 - 13 = 7, and moving one more step brings us to the 6th element).\n- The 6th element is the bubble.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the bubble, move 19 steps counterclockwise.\n- The bubble is the 6th element.\n- Moving 19 steps counterclockwise from the bubble lands us on the 7th element (since 6 + 19 = 25, and 25 mod 20 = 5, so we land on the 7th element).\n- The 7th element is the Nile crocodile.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the Nile crocodile, move 7 steps clockwise.\n- The Nile crocodile is the 7th element.\n- Moving 7 steps clockwise from the Nile crocodile lands us on the 14th element (since 7 + 7 = 14).\n- The 14th element is the gorilla.\n\nNow, let's combine all the movements together:\n\n1. Start from the padlock.\n2. Move 13 steps clockwise: This lands us on the bubble.\n3. Move 19 steps counterclockwise: This lands us on the Nile crocodile.\n4. Move 7 steps clockwise: This lands us on the gorilla.\n5.
