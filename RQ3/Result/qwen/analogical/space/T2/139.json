Let's break down the problem into simpler steps and create related problems for clarity.\n\n### Problem 1:\nYou start at the African bush elephant and move 6 steps counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The African bush elephant is at position 8 (assuming positions are numbered from 0 to 19, starting from the hard disk drive).\n- Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from position 8 lands you at position \\(8 - 6 = 2\\).\n- Position 2 contains a tricycle.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 1 is: tricycle.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the African bush elephant, you move 14 steps counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The African bush elephant is at position 8.\n- Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise from position 8 lands you at position \\(8 - 14 = -6\\).\n- Since the path is circular, we need to convert -6 to a positive position by adding 20 (the total number of positions): \\(-6 + 20 = 14\\).\n- Position 14 contains a radiator.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 2 is: radiator.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the African bush elephant, you move 6 steps counter-clockwise and then 14 steps counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- First, move 6 steps counter-clockwise from position 8 to position 2 (tricycle).\n- From position 2, move another 14 steps counter-clockwise. \n- Position \\(2 - 14 = -12\\).\n- Converting -12 to a positive position by adding 20: \\(-12 + 20 = 8\\).\n- Position 8 contains the African bush elephant.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 3 is: African bush elephant.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the African bush elephant, you move 6 steps counter-clockwise and then 14 steps counter-clockwise. \n\n**Solution:**\n- First, move 6 steps counter-clockwise from position 8 to position 2 (tricycle).\n- From position 2, move another 14 steps counter-clockwise.\n- Position \\(2 - 14 = -12\\).\n- Converting -12 to a positive position by adding 20: \\(-12 + 20 = 8\\).\n- Position 8 contains the African bush elephant.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: African bush elephant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
