Move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the European green lizard: Position = Cucumber.\n2. Move 1 step clockwise from the Cucumber: Position = Wool.\n3. Move 8 steps clockwise from the Wool: Position = European Green Lizard.\n\nSince the final position is the same as the initial position (European Green Lizard), the item you find is the European Green Lizard.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: European Green Lizard."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
