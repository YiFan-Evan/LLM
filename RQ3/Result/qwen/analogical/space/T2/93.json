What do you find?\n- **Solution:** Starting from the apiary and moving 2 steps counter-clockwise, you pass the butternut squash and the bucket. Therefore, you end up at the cocktail shaker.\n  \n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** From the position after moving 2 steps counter-clockwise, you then move 2 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n- **Solution:** After moving 2 steps counter-clockwise and landing on the cocktail shaker, moving 2 steps clockwise from the cocktail shaker, you pass the apiary and the broccoli. Therefore, you end up at the magnetic compass.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** If you start at the apiary and make two moves totaling 4 steps (regardless of direction), what do you find?\n- **Solution:** Whether you move 2 steps counter-clockwise followed by 2 steps clockwise or vice versa, the net effect is that you end up at the magnetic compass.\n\nGiven these solutions, we can now determine the final answer for the original problem.\n\nStarting from the apiary and moving 2 steps counter-clockwise, you reach the cocktail shaker.
