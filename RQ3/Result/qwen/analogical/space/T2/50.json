So, moving 10 steps clockwise from the waffle iron brings you back to the waffle iron.\n\n### Problem 3:\nGiven the above movements, what is the final item you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- After moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the pencil case, you land on the waffle iron.\n- Then, moving 10 steps clockwise from the waffle iron still leaves you on the waffle iron.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: waffle iron"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
