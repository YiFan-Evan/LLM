Let's consider three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the apiary, move 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- Initial position: apiary\n- Movement: 6 steps counter-clockwise\n- Calculation: The path has 20 dots. Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise means moving 14 steps clockwise (20 - 6 = 14).\n- Final position: Starting from the apiary, moving 14 steps clockwise lands us on the Cocker Spaniels.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the new position (Cocker Spaniels), move 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- Initial position: Cocker Spaniels\n- Movement: 10 steps clockwise\n- Calculation: Starting from Cocker Spaniels and moving 10 steps clockwise lands us on the snail.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the new position (snail), move 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- Initial position: snail\n- Movement: 9 steps counter-clockwise\n- Calculation: Moving 9 steps counter-clockwise means moving 11 steps clockwise (20 - 9 = 11). Starting from the snail and moving 11 steps clockwise lands us on the mink.\n\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\n\n- Initial position: apiary\n- Movements: \n  1. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise: lands on Cocker Spaniels.\n  2. Move 10 steps clockwise: lands on snail.\n  3. Move 9 steps counter-clockwise: lands on mink.\n  4. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise: lands on Cocker Spaniels again (since 9 + 7 = 16, and moving 16 steps counter-clockwise from snail is equivalent to moving 4 steps clockwise from snail, which lands us back on Cocker Spaniels).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Cocker Spaniels"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
