Let's create three related but not identical problems to illustrate different scenarios.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the umbrella, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** The umbrella is the 6th element in the list (starting from the top). Moving 18 steps counter-clockwise means moving 2 steps forward since \\( 20 - 18 = 2 \\). Therefore, starting from the umbrella, moving 2 steps forward lands you on the megalith.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the umbrella, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then move another 2 steps in the same direction.\n- **Solution:** First, move 18 steps counter-clockwise from the umbrella, which lands you on the megalith. Then, moving another 2 steps counter-clockwise from the megalith lands you on the police van.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the umbrella, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then move another 2 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** First, move 18 steps counter-clockwise from the umbrella, which lands you on the megalith.
