Here are three related problems and their solutions:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the oboe, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**: The items in counter-clockwise order from the oboe are a moving van, a swimming cap, a Pekingese, a toilet paper, a brass, a Whippet, a barrel, a Geoffroy's spider monkey, a plate, a Norwegian Elkhound, a yellow garden spider, a pitcher, an overskirt, a hatchet, a syringe, and a wolf spider. Moving one step counter-clockwise from the oboe lands you on the moving van.\n- **Answer**: Moving van\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the oboe, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**: Moving six steps counter-clockwise from the oboe lands you on the Geoffroy's spider monkey.\n- **Answer**: Geoffroy's spider monkey\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the oboe, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction and then by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**: First, moving five steps clockwise from the oboe lands you on the Geoffroy's spider monkey. Then, moving four more steps clockwise from the Geoffroy's spider monkey lands you on the Norwegian Elkhound.\n- **Answer**: Norwegian Elkhound\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the oboe, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally by 4 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Step-by-step Movement**:\n  - Move 1 step counter-clockwise: From the oboe to the moving van.\n  - Move 6 steps counter-clockwise: From the moving van to the Geoffroy's spider monkey.\n  - Move 5 steps clockwise: From the Geoffroy's spider monkey to the Norwegian Elkhound.\n  - Move 4 steps clockwise: From the Norwegian Elkhound to the yellow garden spider.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: yellow garden spider"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
