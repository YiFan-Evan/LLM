What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The tent is the third dot clockwise from the face powder.\n- Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the tent brings you to the dot containing the Angora rabbit.\n\n**Answer:** Angora rabbit\n\n### Problem 2\nStarting from the tent, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the tent (third dot clockwise from the face powder), moving 5 steps clockwise lands you on the bolete.\n\n**Answer:** Bolete\n\n### Problem 3\nStarting from the tent, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the tent (third dot clockwise from the face powder), moving 9 steps clockwise lands you on the tiger.\n\n**Answer:** Tiger\n\n### Original Problem Solution\nNow we will solve the original problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:** Tent (third dot clockwise from the face powder).\n2. **Move Counter-Clockwise by 2 Steps:** \n   - From the tent (Angora rabbit), moving 2 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the face powder.\n3. **Move Clockwise by 5 Steps:** \n   - From the face powder, moving 5 steps clockwise lands you on the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\n4. **Move Clockwise by 9 Steps:** \n   - From the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, moving 9 steps clockwise lands you on the black-and-white colobus.\n5. **Move Counter-Clockwise by 8 Steps:** \n   - From the black-and-white colobus, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the mountain bike.\n\n**Answer:** Therefore, the final answer is: mountain bike"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
