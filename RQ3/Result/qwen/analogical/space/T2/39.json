If you move 5 steps clockwise, how many full rotations around the circle will you make, and what will be your final position?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Since the path consists of 5 dots, moving 5 steps clockwise means you complete exactly one full rotation around the circle.\n- After completing one full rotation, you end up back at the starting point, which has the stretcher.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Saluki, if you move 3 steps clockwise, what item will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- From the Saluki, moving 3 steps clockwise would lead you to the necklace.\n- Therefore, you will find the necklace.\n\n### Problem 3:\nIf you start at the hartebeest and move 4 steps clockwise, what will be your final position?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting at the hartebeest, moving 4 steps clockwise would bring you to the necklace.\n- Thus, you will find the necklace.\n\nNow, solving the original problem:\n\n- You start at the Saluki.\n- Moving 5 steps clockwise means you complete one full rotation around the circle.\n- Therefore, you end up back at the starting point, which has the Saluki.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: Saluki.**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
