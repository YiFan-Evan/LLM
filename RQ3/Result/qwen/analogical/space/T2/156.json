What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the drilling rig, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise, you pass through the prayer rug, Keeshond, vending machine, crane, moped, pajamas, and land on the coho salmon.\n\n**Answer:** Coho salmon\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the coho salmon, you move 2 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the coho salmon, moving 2 steps clockwise, you pass through the ring-necked snake and land on the centipede.\n\n**Answer:** Centipede\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the centipede, you move 3 steps counter-clockwise.
