Here are three related problems:\n\n**Problem 1:** \nStarting from the common redshank, move 16 steps counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n- **Solution:** Since the path has 20 dots, moving 16 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank means you move backwards (counter-clockwise) 16 steps. Counting backwards from the common redshank, the sequence would be:\n  - Common redshank -> switch -> bath towel -> bookstore -> mud turtle -> chest -> golf ball -> crate -> Lhasa Apso -> patas monkey -> prison -> analog clock -> trolleybus -> car mirror -> eel -> screw.\n  Therefore, after 16 steps counter-clockwise, you find a screw.\n\n**Problem 2:** \nStarting from the screw, move 20 steps counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n- **Solution:** Moving 20 steps counter-clockwise on a circular path of 20 dots brings you back to the starting point. So, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from the screw brings you back to the screw.\n\n**Problem 3:** \nStarting from the common redshank, move 16 steps counter-clockwise and then 20 steps counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n- **Solution:** From Problem 1, moving 16 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank lands you on the screw. Now, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from the screw brings you back to the screw (as explained in Problem 2).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: screw"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
