Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the badger, move 2 steps counter-clockwise.\n- Initial Position: Badger\n- Movement: 2 steps counter-clockwise\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the badger, you reach the plunger.\n2. Moving another step counter-clockwise from the plunger, you reach the fox squirrel.\n\nSo, after moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the badger, you are at the fox squirrel.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the fox squirrel, move 2 steps clockwise.\n- Initial Position: Fox Squirrel\n- Movement: 2 steps clockwise\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Moving 1 step clockwise from the fox squirrel, you reach the schooner.\n2. Moving another step clockwise from the schooner, you reach the frilled-necked lizard.\n\nSo, after moving 2 steps clockwise from the fox squirrel, you are at the frilled-necked lizard.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the badger, move 2 steps counter-clockwise and then 2 steps clockwise.\n- Initial Position: Badger\n- Movement: 2 steps counter-clockwise followed by 2 steps clockwise\n\n**Solution:**\n1. From the badger, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise lands you at the fox squirrel (as solved in Problem 1).\n2. From the fox squirrel, moving 2 steps clockwise lands you at the frilled-necked lizard (as solved in Problem 2).\n\nSo, after moving 2 steps counter-clockwise and then 2 steps clockwise from the badger, you are at the frilled-necked lizard.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: frilled-necked lizard"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
