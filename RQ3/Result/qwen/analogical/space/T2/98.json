Let's define the positions of the dots as follows:\n\n- Top (starting point): Bald Eagle\n- Clockwise from Bald Eagle: American Dipper, Pedestal, Gondola, Ladle, Black-and-White Colobus, Patio, Manhole Cover, Rose Hip, Albatross\n\nStarting position: Patio (7th dot).\n\n1. Move 2 steps clockwise:\n   - From Patio (7th dot), moving 2 steps clockwise lands you on the Manhole Cover (8th dot).\n\n2. Move 8 steps counterclockwise:\n   - From Manhole Cover (8th dot), moving 8 steps counterclockwise lands you back at the Bald Eagle (1st dot). \n     (Since there are 10 dots, moving 8 steps counterclockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise.)\n\n3.
