Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Description**: Starting from the goldfinch, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: The goldfinch is the 8th element in the list. Moving 15 steps counter-clockwise means moving 5 steps forward (since 20 - 15 = 5). Counting 5 steps forward from the goldfinch, you land on the American black bear.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: From the American black bear, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: The American black bear is the 9th element in the list. Moving 15 steps clockwise means moving 5 steps backward (since 20 - 15 = 5). Counting 5 steps backward from the American black bear, you land on the binoculars.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: Starting from the goldfinch, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction and then by 15 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: First, move 15 steps counter-clockwise from the goldfinch to reach the American black bear. Then, move 15 steps clockwise from the American black bear to reach the binoculars.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: binoculars."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
