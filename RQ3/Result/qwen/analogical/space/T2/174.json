What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start from the crate.\n2. Move 16 steps clockwise: You will be on the Alpine ibex.\n3. Move 19 steps counter-clockwise: Since there are only 20 dots, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (since 20 - 19 = 1). So, you will be on the white stork.\n4. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 15 steps clockwise (since 20 - 5 = 15). So, you will be on the cauldron.\n\nThus, the final answer for Problem 1 is: **cauldron**\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the crate, you move around the ring by 16 steps in a clockwise direction, then 19 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 13 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start from the crate.\n2. Move 16 steps clockwise: You will be on the Alpine ibex.\n3. Move 19 steps counter-clockwise: Since there are only 20 dots, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (since 20 - 19 = 1). So, you will be on the white stork.\n4. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 7 steps clockwise (since 20 - 13 = 7). So, you will be on the hen-of-the-woods.\n\nThus, the final answer for Problem 2 is: **hen-of-the-woods**\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the crate, you move around the ring by 16 steps in a clockwise direction, then 19 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 5 steps in a clockwise direction.
