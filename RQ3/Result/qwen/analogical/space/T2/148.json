Here are three related problems:\n\n**Problem 1:** \nStarting from the scooter, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n- Solution: Starting from the scooter, moving 5 steps clockwise lands you on the scarf. Therefore, the final answer is: scarf.\n\n**Problem 2:** \nStarting from the Pickelhaube, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n- Solution: Starting from the Pickelhaube, moving 15 steps clockwise brings you to the Maltese. Therefore, the final answer is: Maltese.\n\n**Problem 3:** \nStarting from the kimono, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n- Solution: Starting from the kimono, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the French Bulldog. Therefore, the final answer is: French Bulldog.\n\nNow, solving the original problem:\n- Starting from the Pickelhaube, you move around the ring by 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- The circular path has 20 dots, so moving 20 steps counter-clockwise means you end up exactly where you started. Thus, you find the Pickelhaube again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Pickelhaube."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
