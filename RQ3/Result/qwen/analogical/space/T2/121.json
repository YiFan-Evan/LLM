What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: snoek.\n- Move 13 steps clockwise: The sequence of items from the snoek would be lionfish, peacock, Schipperke, sidewinder, plunger, coho salmon, taxicab, brain coral, mailbox, dome, Pyrenean Mountain Dog, ox, and finally, an Otterhound.\n- Therefore, after moving 13 steps clockwise from the snoek, you will find an Otterhound.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the snoek, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. Then you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction again. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: snoek.\n- Move 3 steps clockwise: The sequence of items from the snoek would be a lionfish, peacock, and Schipperke.\n- Move another 3 steps clockwise: The next item is a sidewinder.\n- Therefore, after moving 6 steps clockwise from the snoek, you will find a sidewinder.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the snoek, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. Then you move around the ring by 12 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: snoek.\n- Move 3 steps clockwise: The sequence of items from the snoek would be a lionfish, peacock, and Schipperke.\n- Move 12 steps counter-clockwise: From the Schipperke, moving 12 steps counter-clockwise would bring you back to the snoek (since moving 12 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 8 steps clockwise, which lands you back at the snoek).\n- Therefore, after moving 3 steps clockwise and then 12 steps counter-clockwise from the snoek, you will find a snoek.\n\n### Final Problem:\nStarting from the snoek, you move around the ring by 13 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally by 12 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: snoek.\n- Move 13 steps clockwise: You land on an Otterhound.\n- Move 3 steps clockwise: You land on a wallaby.\n- Move another 3 steps clockwise: You land on a tow truck.\n- Move 12 steps counter-clockwise: From the tow truck, moving 12 steps counter-clockwise lands you at a Chihuahua (since moving 12 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 8 steps clockwise, which brings you from the tow truck to a Chihuahua).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Chihuahua**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
