The elements are arranged in a clockwise sequence starting from the cloak. Therefore, moving 18 steps counter-clockwise means moving 2 steps clockwise (since 20 - 18 = 2). So, you end up at the wok.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at cloak.\n- Move 18 steps counter-clockwise: equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise.\n- Final position: wok.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the orangutan, you move 18 steps counter-clockwise. The orangutan is the 17th element in the list (counting from 1 at the cloak). Moving 18 steps counter-clockwise means moving 2 steps clockwise (since 20 - 18 = 2). So, you end up at the wok.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at orangutan.\n- Move 18 steps counter-clockwise: equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise.\n- Final position: wok.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the orangutan, you move 13 steps counter-clockwise. The orangutan is the 17th element in the list (counting from 1 at the cloak). Moving 13 steps counter-clockwise means moving 7 steps clockwise (since 20 - 13 = 7).
