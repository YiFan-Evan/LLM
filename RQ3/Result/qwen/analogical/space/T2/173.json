Let's start by defining the initial positions and movements more clearly.\n\n### Problem 1:\nYou start at the dot labeled \"shower curtain\" and move 6 steps counter-clockwise. Where do you end up?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The path has 20 dots.\n- Starting at \"shower curtain,\" moving 6 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 6 from the starting position.\n- Since the path is circular, we need to use modulo arithmetic.\n- Position = (Starting position - 6) % 20\n\nThe starting position is the 18th dot (since \"shower curtain\" is the 18th dot in the list). So:\n\nPosition = (18 - 6) % 20 = 12 % 20 = 12\n\nYou end up at the 12th dot, which is a \"ski.\"\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the \"ski,\" you then move 2 steps clockwise. Where do you end up?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position is the 12th dot (\"ski\").\n- Moving 2 steps clockwise means adding 2 to the starting position.\n- Position = (Starting position + 2) % 20\n\nPosition = (12 + 2) % 20 = 14 % 20 = 14\n\nYou end up at the 14th dot, which is an \"Alaskan Malamute.\"\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the \"Alaskan Malamute,\" you then move 5 steps counter-clockwise. Where do you end up?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position is the 14th dot (\"Alaskan Malamute\").\n- Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 5 from the starting position.\n- Position = (Starting position - 5) % 20\n\nPosition = (14 - 5) % 20 = 9 % 20 = 9\n\nYou end up at the 9th dot, which is a \"filing cabinet.\"\n\n### Final Movement:\nFrom the \"filing cabinet,\" you then move 10 steps counter-clockwise. Where do you end up?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position is the 9th dot (\"filing cabinet\").\n- Moving 10 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 10 from the starting position.\n- Position = (Starting position - 10) % 20\n\nPosition = (9 - 10) % 20 = -1 % 20 = 19\n\nYou end up at the 19th dot, which is a \"sea lion.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: sea lion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
