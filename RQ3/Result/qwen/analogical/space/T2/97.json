Let's break down the problem into simpler steps:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the dragonfly, move 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n- The dragonfly is the second element in the clockwise sequence starting from the espresso machine.\n- Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise means moving 3 steps clockwise (since 10 - 7 = 3).\n- Moving 3 steps clockwise from the dragonfly brings us to the leatherback sea turtle.\n\n**Solution for Problem 1:** Leatherback sea turtle\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the leatherback sea turtle, move 9 steps clockwise.\n\n- Moving 9 steps clockwise means moving 1 step counter-clockwise (since 10 - 9 = 1).\n- Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the leatherback sea turtle brings us back to the dragonfly.\n\n**Solution for Problem 2:** Dragonfly\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the dragonfly, move 2 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n- Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise means moving 8 steps clockwise (since 10 - 2 = 8).\n- Moving 8 steps clockwise from the dragonfly brings us to the home theater.\n\n**Solution for Problem 3:** Home theater\n\nNow, let's summarize the complete movement:\n\n1.
