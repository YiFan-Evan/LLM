Moving in a clockwise direction, the elements on the path are a tiger, a velvet, a switch, and a stopwatch. Starting from the Welsh Springer Spaniel, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the Welsh Springer Spaniel, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise means you move past the stopwatch and the switch, landing on the velvet.\n\n**Answer:** velvet\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou are initially positioned on the dot where there is a Welsh Springer Spaniel. Moving in a clockwise direction, the elements on the path are a tiger, a velvet, a switch, and a stopwatch.
