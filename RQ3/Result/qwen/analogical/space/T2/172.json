Let's break it down into three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the Arctic fox, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: Arctic fox.\n- Moving 5 steps clockwise: Arctic fox -> Cairn Terrier -> envelope -> red king crab -> thimble -> dung beetle.\n- Therefore, the item after moving 5 steps is the dung beetle.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Arctic fox, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: Arctic fox.\n- Moving 10 steps clockwise: Arctic fox -> Cairn Terrier -> envelope -> red king crab -> thimble -> dung beetle -> newt -> Dutch oven -> warthog -> recreational vehicle -> scoreboard.\n- Therefore, the item after moving 10 steps is the scoreboard.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the Arctic fox, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: Arctic fox.\n- Moving 15 steps clockwise: Arctic fox -> Cairn Terrier -> envelope -> red king crab -> thimble -> dung beetle -> newt -> Dutch oven -> warthog -> recreational vehicle -> scoreboard -> prayer rug -> barn -> indigo bunting -> football helmet.\n- Therefore, the item after moving 15 steps is the football helmet.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the Arctic fox, you move around the ring by 20 steps in a clockwise direction.
