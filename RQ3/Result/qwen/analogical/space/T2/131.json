Let's define the problem more clearly and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the ice cream, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- **Initial Position**: Ice cream.\n- **Movement**: Counter-clockwise by 2 steps.\n- **Calculation**: \n  - Ice cream is at position 13 (assuming positions are numbered from 0 to 19).\n  - Moving counter-clockwise by 2 steps: \\(13 - 2 = 11\\). If the result is negative, we add 20 (since the path is circular).\n\nThe position is now at 11, which corresponds to a water snake.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the new position (water snake), you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- **Initial Position**: Water snake (position 11).\n- **Movement**: Counter-clockwise by 7 steps.\n- **Calculation**:\n  - Position 11 minus 7 steps: \\(11 - 7 = 4\\).\n\nThe position is now at 4, which corresponds to a harp.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the new position (harp), you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Initial Position**: Harp (position 4).\n- **Movement**: Clockwise by 9 steps.\n- **Calculation**:\n  - Position 4 plus 9 steps: \\(4 + 9 = 13\\).\n\nThe position is now at 13, which corresponds to an ice cream.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nCombining all movements:\n1. Start at ice cream (position 13).\n2. Move counter-clockwise by 2 steps: \\(13 - 2 = 11\\) (water snake).\n3. Move counter-clockwise by 7 steps: \\(11 - 7 = 4\\) (harp).\n4. Move clockwise by 9 steps: \\(4 + 9 = 13\\) (ice cream).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ice cream"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
