What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the Scottish Terrier, moving 3 steps clockwise, you will land on the Tench.\n\n**Answer:** Tench\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou start at the Parking Meter and move 9 steps counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the Parking Meter, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise, you will land on the Dunlin.\n\n**Answer:** Dunlin\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou start at the Leaf Beetle and move 5 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the Leaf Beetle, moving 5 steps clockwise, you will land on the Clothes Iron.\n\n**Answer:** Clothes Iron\n\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\n\n### Original Problem:\nStarting from the Parking Meter, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 9 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 1 step in a clockwise direction.
