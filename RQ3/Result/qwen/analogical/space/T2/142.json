Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and consider similar scenarios for clarity.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting at the trimaran, move 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution**: The trimaran is at position 15 (clockwise from the top). Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise lands us at the position of the half-track (position 2).\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the new position (half-track), move 12 steps clockwise.\n- **Solution**: Starting from the half-track (position 2), moving 12 steps clockwise brings us to the position of the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (position 14).\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the new position (eastern diamondback rattlesnake), move 17 steps clockwise.\n- **Solution**: Starting from the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (position 14), moving 17 steps clockwise brings us to the position of the balloon (position 11).\n\n### Original Problem:\nNow, starting from the trimaran (position 15), perform all movements in sequence: \n- Move 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n- Then move 12 steps clockwise.\n- Then move 17 steps clockwise.\n- Then move 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nLet's calculate the final position step-by-step:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: Trimaran (position 15).\n2. **Move 8 Steps Counter-Clockwise**:\n   - From position 15, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise lands us at position 7 (Australian Kelpie).\n3. **Move 12 Steps Clockwise**:\n   - From position 7, moving 12 steps clockwise lands us at position 19 (throne).\n4. **Move 17 Steps Clockwise**:\n   - From position 19, moving 17 steps clockwise lands us at position 16 (paper knife).\n5. **Move 13 Steps Counter-Clockwise**:\n   - From position 16, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise lands us at position 3 (drilling rig).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: drilling rig"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
