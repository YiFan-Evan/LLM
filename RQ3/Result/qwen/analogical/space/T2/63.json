The 1st element is a church.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the church (the result from Problem 2), you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the church (the 1st element), moving 5 steps clockwise places you at the 6th element, which is the vase.\n\nNow, combining all the movements:\n\n- Starting from the vase, you move 1 step clockwise to reach the junco.\n- From the junco, you move 4 steps clockwise to reach the church.\n- From the church, you move 5 steps clockwise to reach the vase.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: vase"}]
