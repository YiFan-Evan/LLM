Let's first describe three related but not identical problems and their solutions.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the dog sled, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**:\n  - The path consists of 10 dots.\n  - Moving 9 steps counter-clockwise from the dog sled (top dot), you effectively move 1 step clockwise (since 10 - 9 = 1).\n  - Therefore, you end up at the barn.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the barn, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**:\n  - Starting from the barn, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise means you move past the red-breasted merganser and stop at the promontory.\n  - Therefore, you end up at the promontory.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the promontory, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**:\n  - Starting from the promontory, moving 2 steps clockwise means you move past the Asian elephant and stop at the spotted salamander.\n  - Therefore, you end up at the spotted salamander.\n\nNow, let's combine these movements to solve the original problem:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Dog sled.\n2. **First Movement**: Move 9 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - From the dog sled, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise lands you at the barn.\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 2 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - From the barn, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise lands you at the promontory.\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 2 steps clockwise.\n   - From the promontory, moving 2 steps clockwise lands you at the spotted salamander.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: spotted salamander"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
