What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**: \n  - Starting position: Black swan.\n  - Moving 2 steps clockwise: Black swan -> Bagel -> Football Helmet.\n  - Therefore, the final answer is: Football Helmet.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the black swan, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - Starting position: Black swan.\n  - Moving 3 steps clockwise: Black swan -> Bagel -> Football Helmet -> Chainsaw.\n  - Therefore, the final answer is: Chainsaw.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the black swan, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - Starting position: Black swan.\n  - Moving 4 steps clockwise: Black swan -> Bagel -> Football Helmet -> Chainsaw -> Weimaraner.\n  - Therefore, the final answer is: Weimaraner.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the black swan, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - Starting position: Black swan.\n  - Moving 5 steps clockwise: Black swan -> Bagel -> Football Helmet -> Chainsaw -> Weimaraner -> Black swan.\n  - Since the path is circular, moving 5 steps brings you back to the starting point, which is the black swan.\n  - Therefore, the final answer is: Black swan."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
