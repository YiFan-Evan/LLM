You move 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Which item do you encounter?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the Border Collie, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the golf ball because:\n- 1 step counter-clockwise lands you on the upright piano.\n- 2 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the golf ball.\n- 3 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the golf ball.\n\nTherefore, the item you find is the golf ball.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou start at the golf ball. You then move 5 steps in a clockwise direction. Which item do you encounter?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the golf ball, moving 5 steps clockwise means:\n- 1 step clockwise lands you on the chambered nautilus.\n- 2 steps clockwise lands you on the Border Collie.\n- 3 steps clockwise lands you on the Border Collie again (since the path is circular).\n- 4 steps clockwise lands you on the Border Collie.\n- 5 steps clockwise lands you on the upright piano.\n\nTherefore, the item you find is the upright piano.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou start at the golf ball. You move 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then 5 steps in a clockwise direction. Which item do you encounter?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the golf ball:\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise to reach the golf ball (already there).\n- Then move 5 steps clockwise:\n  - 1 step clockwise lands you on the chambered nautilus.\n  - 2 steps clockwise lands you on the Border Collie.\n  - 3 steps clockwise lands you on the Border Collie.\n  - 4 steps clockwise lands you on the Border Collie.\n  - 5 steps clockwise lands you on the upright piano.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: upright piano."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
