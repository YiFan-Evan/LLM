Golden Retriever\n2. Plate\n3. Tram\n4. Lab Coat\n5. Airliner\n6. Projector\n7. Rifle\n8. Water Tower\n9. Soup Bowl\n\nSo, after moving 9 steps clockwise from the Golden Retriever, you find a **Soup Bowl**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Soup Bowl (from Problem 1), you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe sequence of elements starting from the Soup Bowl moving 7 steps clockwise:\n1. Soup Bowl\n2. Water Tower\n3. Rifle\n4. Projector\n5. Airliner\n6. Lab Coat\n7. Tram\n8. Plate\n\nSo, after moving 7 steps clockwise from the Soup Bowl, you find a **Plate**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the Plate (from Problem 2), you move around the ring by 13 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe sequence of elements starting from the Plate moving 13 steps counter-clockwise:\n1. Plate\n2. Tram\n3. Lab Coat\n4. Airliner\n5. Projector\n6. Rifle\n7. Water Tower\n8. Soup Bowl\n9. Water Tower\n10. Soup Bowl\n11. Water Tower\n12. Soup Bowl\n13.

Start from the Golden Retriever.\n2. Move 9 steps clockwise: You end up at the Soup Bowl.\n3. Move 7 steps clockwise from the Soup Bowl: You end up at the Plate.\n4. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise from the Plate: You end up at the Water Tower.\n5. Move 18 steps counter-clockwise from the Water Tower: \n\nThe sequence of elements starting from the Water Tower moving 18 steps counter-clockwise:\n1. Water Tower\n2. Soup Bowl\n3. Plate\n4.
