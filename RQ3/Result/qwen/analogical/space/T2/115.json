Let's break down the problem into simpler steps and create three related problems for clarity.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the mantis, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Mantis.\n- Moving 6 steps clockwise: Mantis -> Pomegranate -> Threshing Machine -> Screw -> Loupe -> Microphone -> Parking Meter.\n- Therefore, the final position after 6 steps clockwise is the Parking Meter.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the mantis, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Mantis.\n- Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise: Mantis -> Kit Fox -> Paddle Wheel -> Parking Meter -> Microphone -> Loupe -> Screw -> Threshing Machine -> Pomegranate.\n- Therefore, the final position after 8 steps counter-clockwise is the Pomegranate.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the mantis, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Mantis.\n- Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise: Mantis -> Kit Fox -> Paddle Wheel -> Parking Meter -> Microphone -> Loupe -> Screw.\n- Therefore, the final position after 6 steps counter-clockwise is the Screw.\n\nNow, combining these movements:\n- First movement: Move 6 steps clockwise from Mantis to Parking Meter.\n- Second movement: Move 8 steps counter-clockwise from Parking Meter to Pomegranate.\n- Third movement: Move 6 steps counter-clockwise from Pomegranate to Screw.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Screw"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
