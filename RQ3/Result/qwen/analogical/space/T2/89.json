Counting 6 steps counter-clockwise means moving past the four-poster bed, the cliff, the monastery, the alligator, and the lionfish, landing on the eastern hog-nosed snake.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** From the eastern hog-nosed snake, move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** The eastern hog-nosed snake is the seventh dot in the clockwise order. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means moving past the conch and the stone wall, landing on the pizza.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** From the pizza, move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** The pizza is the tenth dot in the clockwise order. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means moving past the four-poster bed, the cliff, and the badger, landing on the monastery.\n\nNow, combining all the movements:\n- Start from the badger.\n- Move 6 steps counter-clockwise: land on the eastern hog-nosed snake.\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: land on the pizza.\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: land on the monastery.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: monastery"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
