Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nYou start at the photocopier and move 14 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting at the photocopier, moving 14 steps clockwise:\n1. Photocopier -> Military cap (1 step)\n2. Military cap -> White-headed capuchin (2 steps)\n3. White-headed capuchin -> Eastern diamondback rattlesnake (3 steps)\n4. Eastern diamondback rattlesnake -> Jackfruit (4 steps)\n5. Jackfruit -> Monarch butterfly (5 steps)\n6. Monarch butterfly -> Cowboy hat (6 steps)\n7. Cowboy hat -> Jaguar (7 steps)\n8. Jaguar -> Vase (8 steps)\n9. Vase -> Bookcase (9 steps)\n10. Bookcase -> Gong (10 steps)\n11. Gong -> Abacus (11 steps)\n12. Abacus -> Plow (12 steps)\n13. Plow -> Sunscreen (13 steps)\n14. Sunscreen -> Ballpoint pen (14 steps)\n\nSo, after 14 steps, you find a **ballpoint pen**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou start at the ballpoint pen and move 6 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting at the ballpoint pen, moving 6 steps clockwise:\n1. Ballpoint pen -> Sports car (1 step)\n2. Sports car -> Cleaver (2 steps)\n3. Cleaver -> Honeycomb (3 steps)\n4. Honeycomb -> Horizontal bar (4 steps)\n5. Horizontal bar -> Baboon (5 steps)\n6. Baboon -> Photocopier (6 steps)\n\nSo, after 6 steps, you find a **photocopier**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou start at the photocopier and move 14 steps clockwise, then move another 6 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nFirst, you move 14 steps clockwise from the photocopier:\n1. Photocopier -> Military cap (1 step)\n2. Military cap -> White-headed capuchin (2 steps)\n3. White-headed capuchin -> Eastern diamondback rattlesnake (3 steps)\n4. Eastern diamondback rattlesnake -> Jackfruit (4 steps)\n5. Jackfruit -> Monarch butterfly (5 steps)\n6. Monarch butterfly -> Cowboy hat (6 steps)\n7. Cowboy hat -> Jaguar (7 steps)\n8. Jaguar -> Vase (8 steps)\n9. Vase -> Bookcase (9 steps)\n10. Bookcase -> Gong (10 steps)\n11. Gong -> Abacus (11 steps)\n12. Abacus -> Plow (12 steps)\n13. Plow -> Sunscreen (13 steps)\n14. Sunscreen -> Ballpoint pen (14 steps)\n\nNow, starting from the ballpoint pen, you move 6 more steps clockwise:\n1. Ballpoint pen -> Sports car (1 step)\n2. Sports car -> Cleaver (2 steps)\n3. Cleaver -> Honeycomb (3 steps)\n4. Honeycomb -> Horizontal bar (4 steps)\n5. Horizontal bar -> Baboon (5 steps)\n6. Baboon -> Photocopier (6 steps)\n\nSo, after moving 14 steps and then 6 more steps, you find a **photocopier**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: **photocopier**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
