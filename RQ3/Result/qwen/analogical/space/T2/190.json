Moving 13 steps counter-clockwise from position 8 lands you at position \\(8 - 13 = -5\\). Since the path is circular and has 20 positions, we adjust by adding 20: \\(-5 + 20 = 15\\). So, you land on the black-footed ferret.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: From the black-footed ferret, move around the ring by 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: The black-footed ferret is at position 18. Moving 15 steps counter-clockwise from position 18 lands you at position \\(18 - 15 = 3\\). So, you land on the hot dog.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: From the hot dog, move around the ring by 13 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: The hot dog is at position 3. Moving 13 steps counter-clockwise from position 3 lands you at position \\(3 - 13 = -10\\). Adjusting for the circular path: \\(-10 + 20 = 10\\). So, you land on the Afghan Hound.\n\n### Problem 4:\n**Description**: From the Afghan Hound, move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: The Afghan Hound is at position 8. Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from position 8 lands you at position \\(8 - 8 = 0\\).
