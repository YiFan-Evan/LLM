Let's define the problem clearly and solve it step-by-step.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the indri, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The indri is the 3rd dot in the clockwise order.\n- Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the indri means moving 2 steps backwards from the 3rd dot.\n- This brings you to the trifle (the 1st dot).\n\nTherefore, the item found is: **trifle**\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the trifle (which was the result of the previous movement), you then move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The trifle is the 1st dot.\n- Moving 3 steps clockwise from the trifle brings you to the broom (4th dot).\n\nTherefore, the item found is: **broom**\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the broom (which was the result of the previous movement), you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The broom is the 4th dot.\n- Moving 10 steps clockwise from the broom means completing one full circle (since there are 10 dots in total), so you end up back at the broom (4th dot).\n\nTherefore, the item found is: **broom**\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nCombining all the movements together:\n\n1. Start at the indri (3rd dot).\n2. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: You reach the trifle (1st dot).\n3. Move 3 steps clockwise from the trifle: You reach the broom (4th dot).\n4. Move 10 steps clockwise from the broom: You complete a full circle and return to the broom (4th dot).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **broom**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
