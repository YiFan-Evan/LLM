Each problem will help us understand the movement and positioning better.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the bee, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The bee is at the starting point.\n- Moving 1 step clockwise from the bee, you reach the goose.\n- Moving another step clockwise from the goose, you reach the match.\nTherefore, the item you find is a **match**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the pretzel, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the pretzel, moving one step counter-clockwise leads you to the balance beam.\n- Moving another step counter-clockwise from the balance beam leads you to the coffee mug.\n- Moving another step counter-clockwise from the coffee mug leads you to the prairie grouse.\nTherefore, the item you find is a **prairie grouse**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the mosquito net, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the mosquito net, moving one step clockwise leads you to the pretzel.\n- Moving another step clockwise from the pretzel leads you to the balance beam.\n- Moving another step clockwise from the balance beam leads you to the coffee mug.\n- Moving another step clockwise from the coffee mug leads you to the brain coral.\nTherefore, the item you find is a **brain coral**.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the pretzel, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction, and then you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Step-by-step Solution:**\n- Starting from the pretzel, moving 1 step clockwise leads you to the balance beam.\n- From the balance beam, moving 1 step counter-clockwise leads you back to the pretzel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **pretzel**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
