Therefore, after moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the chambered nautilus, you will find a **Basenji**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the chambered nautilus, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nIf we move 8 steps counter-clockwise from the chambered nautilus, we can count backwards:\n- 1 step: Basenji\n- 2 steps: half-track\n- 3 steps: turnstile\n- 4 steps: wine bottle\n- 5 steps: hot pot\n- 6 steps: trilobite\n- 7 steps: acorn\n- 8 steps: Weimaraner\n\nSo, after moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the chambered nautilus, you will find a **Weimaraner**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the chambered nautilus, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction twice.\n\n**Solution:**\nFirst movement of 8 steps: Weimaraner (as calculated in Problem 2).\nSecond movement of 8 steps: Since you are already at the Weimaraner, moving another 8 steps counter-clockwise brings you back to the same spot. So, you will find a **Weimaraner** again.\n\nNow, combining all the movements given in the original problem:\n- First, move 1 step counter-clockwise from the chambered nautilus: Basenji.\n- Second, move 8 steps counter-clockwise from Basenji: Weimaraner.\n- Third, move 8 steps counter-clockwise from Weimaraner: Chambered nautilus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Chambered nautilus**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
