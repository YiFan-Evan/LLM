What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the sulphur-crested cockatoo (top), moving 3 steps clockwise means moving to the husky, then the jigsaw puzzle, and finally landing on the tusker.\n\n**Answer:** tusker\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou start at the sulphur-crested cockatoo and move 7 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the sulphur-crested cockatoo (top), moving 7 steps clockwise means moving past the tusker, leaf beetle, and husky, and landing back at the tusker (since the path is circular).\n\n**Answer:** tusker\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou start at the sulphur-crested cockatoo and move 2 steps counter-clockwise.
