What will you find?\n- Solution: Starting at the grey fox, moving 5 steps clockwise lands you on the doormat.\n\n**Problem 2:** You start at the grey fox and move 7 steps counter-clockwise. What will you find?\n- Solution: Starting at the grey fox, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the dung beetle.\n\n**Problem 3:** You start at the grey wolf and move 6 steps clockwise.
