What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at the Cairn Terrier.\n- Move 8 steps clockwise: From the Cairn Terrier to a car wheel.\n- Move 18 steps clockwise: From the car wheel, moving 18 steps is equivalent to moving 18 - 20 = -2 steps (or 2 steps counterclockwise), landing back on the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.\n- Move 1 step clockwise: From the Dandie Dinmont Terrier to a collie.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 1 is: **collie**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Cairn Terrier, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 18 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally by 10 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at the Cairn Terrier.\n- Move 8 steps clockwise: From the Cairn Terrier to a car wheel.\n- Move 18 steps clockwise: From the car wheel, moving 18 steps is equivalent to moving 18 - 20 = -2 steps (or 2 steps counterclockwise), landing back on the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.\n- Move 10 steps clockwise: From the Dandie Dinmont Terrier to a wild boar.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 2 is: **wild boar**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the Cairn Terrier, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 18 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally by 1 step in a clockwise direction, and then by 10 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at the Cairn Terrier.\n- Move 8 steps clockwise: From the Cairn Terrier to a car wheel.\n- Move 18 steps clockwise: From the car wheel, moving 18 steps is equivalent to moving 18 - 20 = -2 steps (or 2 steps counterclockwise), landing back on the Dandie Dinmont Terrier.\n- Move 1 step clockwise: From the Dandie Dinmont Terrier to a collie.\n- Move 10 steps clockwise: From the collie to a wild boar.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 3 is: **wild boar**.\n\n### Original Problem:\nStarting from the Cairn Terrier, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 18 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 1 step in a clockwise direction, and finally by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.
