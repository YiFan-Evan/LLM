Each move will be accounted for in the sequence provided.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Appenzeller Sennenhund\n2. **Move 8 Steps Counter-Clockwise**: \n   - The path is circular, so moving counter-clockwise means we subtract 8 steps from the current position.\n   - Counting backwards from Appenzeller Sennenhund (position 14 if we number them starting from 0), we get: \n     - 14 - 8 = 6 (mod 20)\n   - Position: Small White\n\n3. **Move 6 Steps Clockwise**:\n   - From Small White (position 6), we add 6 steps.\n   - 6 + 6 = 12 (mod 20)\n   - Position: Limousine\n\n4. **Move 17 Steps Counter-Clockwise**:\n   - From Limousine (position 12), we subtract 17 steps.\n   - 12 - 17 = -5 (mod 20)\n   - -5 + 20 = 15 (mod 20)\n   - Position: Beer Bottle\n\n5. **Move 7 Steps Clockwise**:\n   - From Beer Bottle (position 15), we add 7 steps.\n   - 15 + 7 = 22 (mod 20)\n   - 22 - 20 = 2 (mod 20)\n   - Position: Oxygen Mask\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Oxygen Mask."}]
