Moving 1 step counter-clockwise would place you on the previous element, which is the match (the 6th element).\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the match, you then move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution**: The match is the 6th element in the list. Moving 6 steps clockwise from the 6th element would place you on the horizontal bar (the 18th element).\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the horizontal bar, you move around the ring by 19 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution**: The horizontal bar is the 18th element in the list. Moving 19 steps clockwise from the 18th element means moving 19 - 20 = -1 step, which is equivalent to moving 1 step counter-clockwise. This places you on the Airedale Terrier (the 17th element).\n\n### Final Movement:\nFrom the Airedale Terrier, you move around the ring by 17 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution**: The Airedale Terrier is the 17th element in the list. Moving 17 steps clockwise from the 17th element would place you on the Gila monster (the 20th element).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Gila monster"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
