Let's define the circular path with 20 dots and start from the knee pad.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the knee pad, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. \n\n**Solution:**\n- Knee pad is the starting point (position 3).\n- Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise means moving to the left.\n- The positions are numbered from 0 to 19, so moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from position 3 lands you at position 1.\n- The item at position 1 is an English Springer Spaniel.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: English Springer Spaniel.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the knee pad, you move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Knee pad is the starting point (position 3).\n- Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise means moving to the left.\n- Starting from position 3, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise lands you at position 3 + 14 = 17 (since 3 + 14 = 17).\n- The item at position 17 is a triceratops.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: triceratops.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the knee pad, you move around the ring by 17 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Knee pad is the starting point (position 3).\n- Moving 17 steps clockwise means moving to the right.\n- Starting from position 3, moving 17 steps clockwise lands you at position 3 + 17 = 20, which wraps around to position 0 (since 20 % 20 = 0).\n- The item at position 0 is a Samoyed.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: Samoyed.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nNow let's combine all the movements:\n\n1. Starting from the knee pad (position 3), move 2 steps counter-clockwise: position 1 (English Springer Spaniel).\n2. From position 1, move 14 steps counter-clockwise: position 1 + 14 = 15 (stretcher).\n3. From position 15, move 17 steps clockwise: position 15 + 17 = 32, which wraps around to position 12 (beer bottle).\n4. From position 12, move 5 steps clockwise: position 12 + 5 = 17 (triceratops).\n\nCombining these movements, the final position is 17, and the item at position 17 is a triceratops.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: triceratops."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Starting from the power drill (position 8), move 2 steps clockwise: position 10 (mortar).\n2. From position 10, move 14 steps clockwise: position 10 + 14 = 24, which wraps around to position 4 (digital clock).\n3. From position 4, move 17 steps counter-clockwise: position 4 - 17 = -13, which wraps around to position 7 (power drill).\n4. From position 7, move 5 steps counter-clockwise: position 7 - 5 = 2, which wraps around to position 2 (knee pad).\n\nCombining these movements, the final position is 2, and the item at position 2 is a knee pad.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: knee pad."}]
