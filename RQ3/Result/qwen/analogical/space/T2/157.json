Since the path has 20 dots, we convert \\(-4\\) to a positive index by adding 20: \\(-4 + 20 = 16\\).\n- Final position: Traffic light (dot 16)\n\n**Solution**: Traffic light\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: From the traffic light, move 3 steps clockwise.\n- Initial position: Traffic light (dot 16)\n- Movement: 3 steps clockwise\n- Calculation: \\(16 + 3 = 19\\).\n- Final position: Bolete (dot 19)\n\n**Solution**: Bolete\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: From the bolete, move 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n- Initial position: Bolete (dot 19)\n- Movement: 7 steps counter-clockwise\n- Calculation: \\(19 - 7 = 12\\).\n- Final position: Disc brake (dot 12)\n\n**Solution**: Disc brake\n\n### Problem 4:\n**Description**: From the disc brake, move 6 steps clockwise.\n- Initial position: Disc brake (dot 12)\n- Movement: 6 steps clockwise\n- Calculation: \\(12 + 6 = 18\\).\n- Final position: Waste container (dot 18)\n\n**Solution**: Waste container\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Waste container"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
