What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The home theater is the 19th item (counting from 1).\n- Moving 18 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards 18 positions.\n- 19 - 18 = 1, so you end up at the 1st position, which is a radio telescope.\n- Therefore, the item found is: radio telescope.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the home theater, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then move 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- After moving 18 steps counter-clockwise from the home theater, you are at the radio telescope (Problem 1).\n- Moving 10 more steps counter-clockwise from the radio telescope:\n- 1 - 10 = -9, since the path is circular and has 20 dots, -9 + 20 = 11.\n- So you end up at the 11th position, which is a cheetah.\n- Therefore, the item found is: cheetah.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the home theater, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- From Problem 2, after the first two moves, you are at the cheetah (position 11).\n- Moving 6 more steps counter-clockwise:\n- 11 - 6 = 5.\n- So you end up at the 5th position, which is a pot.\n- Therefore, the item found is: pot.\n\n### Final Problem Solution:\nStarting from the home theater, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then 19 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- From Problem 3, after the first three moves, you are at the pot (position 5).\n- Moving 19 more steps counter-clockwise:\n- 5 - 19 = -14, since the path is circular and has 20 dots, -14 + 20 = 6.\n- So you end up at the 6th position, which is an oil filter.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: oil filter."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The oil filter is the 4th item (counting from 1).\n- Moving 18 steps clockwise means moving forward 18 positions.\n- 4 + 18 = 22, and since the path is circular with 20 dots, 22 % 20 = 2.\n- So you end up at the 2nd position, which is a pole.\n- Therefore, the item found is: pole.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the oil filter, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a clockwise direction, then move 10 steps in a clockwise direction.
