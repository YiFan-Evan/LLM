Let's break down the problem into three related scenarios for clarity.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the balloon (top dot), move 3 steps clockwise.\n- **Solution:** Starting at the balloon, moving 3 steps clockwise lands you on the American robin.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the balloon (top dot), move 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** Starting at the balloon, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the tiger.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the odometer, move 9 steps clockwise.\n- **Solution:** Starting at the odometer and moving 9 steps clockwise, you will pass through the following positions: dowitcher, bucket, American robin, Lhasa Apso, balloon, grille, tiger, and duck. The next step (the 9th step) will land you on the power drill.\n\nNow, applying the given movements to the original problem:\n\n1. Start at the odometer.\n2. Move 9 steps clockwise: This places you on the power drill (as per Problem 3).\n3.
