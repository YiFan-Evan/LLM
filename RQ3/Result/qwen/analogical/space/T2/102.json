What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\nThe grey whale is followed by a lens cap. Therefore, moving 1 step clockwise from the grey whale lands you on the lens cap.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the grey whale, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\nStarting from the grey whale and moving 3 steps clockwise involves moving past the lens cap (1 step), the bikini (2 steps), and landing on the solar thermal collector (3 steps).\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the grey whale, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\nStarting from the grey whale and moving 8 steps clockwise involves moving past the lens cap (1 step), the bikini (2 steps), the solar thermal collector (3 steps), the overskirt (4 steps), the notebook computer (5 steps), the paddle (6 steps), and the horse-drawn vehicle (7 steps). The 8th step will land you back on the ladle.\n\n### Combining Movements:\nNow, we combine the movements described in the original problem:\n- Move 1 step clockwise from the grey whale: You land on the lens cap.\n- Move 3 steps clockwise from the lens cap: You land on the solar thermal collector.\n- Move 8 steps clockwise from the solar thermal collector: You land back on the ladle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ladle"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
