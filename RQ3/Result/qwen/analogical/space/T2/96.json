Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the wall clock, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: Wall clock.\n- Moving 3 steps clockwise: Wall clock -> Howler monkey -> Marmot -> King penguin.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: King penguin.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Afghan Hound, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: Afghan Hound.\n- Moving 7 steps clockwise: Afghan Hound -> Chainsaw -> Split-rail fence -> Crash helmet -> Monitor -> Wall clock -> Howler monkey -> Marmot.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Marmot.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the king penguin, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: King penguin.\n- Moving 6 steps clockwise: King penguin -> Afghan Hound -> Chainsaw -> Split-rail fence -> Crash helmet -> Monitor -> Wall clock.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Wall clock.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the Afghan Hound, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: Afghan Hound.\n- Moving 10 steps clockwise: Afghan Hound -> Chainsaw -> Split-rail fence -> Crash helmet -> Monitor -> Wall clock -> Howler monkey -> Marmot -> King penguin -> Afghan Hound -> Chainsaw.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Chainsaw."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
