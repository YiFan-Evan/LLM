At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a notebook computer. Moving in a clockwise direction from the notebook computer, the elements on the path are a holster, a cricket, a cocktail shaker, and a garbage truck. Starting from the holster, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Problem 1:\nYou are positioned on the dot located at the top of the circular path, where there is a notebook computer. Moving in a clockwise direction from the notebook computer, the elements on the path are a holster, a cricket, a cocktail shaker, and a garbage truck. Starting from the notebook computer, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the notebook computer, moving 3 steps clockwise, you will pass through the holster, cricket, and land on the cocktail shaker.\n\n**Answer:** cocktail shaker\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou are positioned on the dot located at the top of the circular path, where there is a notebook computer. Moving in a clockwise direction from the notebook computer, the elements on the path are a holster, a cricket, a cocktail shaker, and a garbage truck. Starting from the notebook computer, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counterclockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nSince the path has only 5 dots, moving 7 steps counterclockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps counterclockwise (7 mod 5 = 2). Starting from the notebook computer and moving 2 steps counterclockwise, you will pass through the garbage truck and end up at the cricket.\n\n**Answer:** cricket\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou are positioned on the dot located at the top of the circular path, where there is a notebook computer. Moving in a clockwise direction from the notebook computer, the elements on the path are a holster, a cricket, a cocktail shaker, and a garbage truck. Starting from the notebook computer, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction.
