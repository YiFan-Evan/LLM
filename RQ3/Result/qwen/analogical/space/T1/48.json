Move 2 steps clockwise: You land on a **Screwdriver**.\n2. From Screwdriver, move 9 steps clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise, so you land on a **Chow Chow**.\n3. From Chow Chow, move 7 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 3 steps clockwise, so you land on a **Pan Flute**.\n\n**Final Answer:** Therefore, the final answer is: **Pan Flute**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
