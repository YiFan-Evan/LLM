What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: Square academic cap.\n- Moving 2 steps clockwise:\n  - 1st step: Remote control.\n  - 2nd step: Ocean liner.\n\nTherefore, the item you find is the **ocean liner**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the square academic cap, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting point: Square academic cap.\n- Moving 3 steps clockwise:\n  - 1st step: Remote control.\n  - 2nd step: Ocean liner.\n  - 3rd step: Fox squirrel.\n\nTherefore, the item you find is the **fox squirrel**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the square academic cap, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction.
