Then, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Starting at the black grouse (top dot).\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise: \n   - Step 1: Soap Dispenser.\n   - Step 2: Conch.\n3. Move 1 step counter-clockwise from the conch:\n   - Counter-clockwise from the conch: Black Grouse.\n   \nTherefore, the final answer is: **Black Grouse**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the black grouse, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction. Then, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Starting at the black grouse (top dot).\n2.
