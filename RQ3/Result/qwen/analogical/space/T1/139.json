Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we can add 20 to -6 to get a positive position within the range: -6 + 20 = Position 14.\n- **Solution:** The item at position 14 is a tiger beetle.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the African bush elephant, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction and then by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- **Description:** The African bush elephant is at position 8.\n- **First Movement:** Move 6 steps counter-clockwise: Position 8 - 6 = Position 2.\n- **Second Movement:** From position 2, move 14 steps counter-clockwise: Position 2 - 14 = Position -12. Adding 20 to -12 gives Position 8.\n- **Solution:** The item at position 8 is the African bush elephant.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the African bush elephant, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- **First Movement:** Position 8 - 6 = Position 2.\n- **Second Movement:** Position 2 - 14 = Position -12.
