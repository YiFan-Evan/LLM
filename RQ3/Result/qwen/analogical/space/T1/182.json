Let's first define the problem clearly and then solve it.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the knee pad, move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The knee pad is the second element on the circular path.\n- Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise means moving to the previous elements.\n- The sequence before the knee pad is: English Springer Spaniel, Samoyed.\n- Therefore, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the knee pad brings you to the Samoyed.\n\n**Answer:** Samoyed\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the knee pad, move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The knee pad is the second element on the circular path.\n- Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise means moving to the elements before the knee pad.\n- Since there are 20 elements in total, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(20 - 14 = 6\\) steps clockwise.\n- Moving 6 steps clockwise from the knee pad brings you to the stinkhorn mushroom (since the knee pad is the 2nd element, moving 6 steps clockwise lands you at the 8th element).\n\n**Answer:** Stinkhorn mushroom\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the knee pad, move around the ring by 17 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The knee pad is the second element on the circular path.\n- Moving 17 steps clockwise means moving forward 17 elements.\n- Moving 17 steps clockwise from the knee pad lands you at the cheetah (since the knee pad is the 2nd element, moving 17 steps clockwise lands you at the 19th element).\n\n**Answer:** Cheetah\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nNow, let's combine all the movements:\n1. Start at the knee pad.\n2. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: Samoyed.\n3. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise: Stinkhorn mushroom.\n4. Move 17 steps clockwise: Cheetah.\n5. Move 5 steps clockwise: Triceratops.\n\n**Answer:** Triceratops\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Triceratops"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
