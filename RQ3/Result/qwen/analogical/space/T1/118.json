We will break down the problem into simpler steps:\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Description:** \nStarting from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Initial position: Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\n- Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: \n  - 1 step: Hummingbird\n  - 2 steps: Fountain\n  - 3 steps: Confectionery store\n  - 4 steps: Loupe\n  - 5 steps: Fountain pen\n\n**Answer for Problem 1:** Fountain pen\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** \nStarting from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Initial position: Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\n- Move 7 steps counter-clockwise:\n  - 1 step: Hummingbird\n  - 2 steps: Fountain\n  - 3 steps: Confectionery store\n  - 4 steps: Loupe\n  - 5 steps: Fountain pen\n  - 6 steps: Magpie\n  - 7 steps: Chime\n\n**Answer for Problem 2:** Chime\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** \nStarting from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Initial position: Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise:\n  - 1 step: Hummingbird\n  - 2 steps: Fountain\n  - 3 steps: Confectionery store\n\n**Answer for Problem 3:** Confectionery store\n\n### Final Problem Solution:\nNow, we need to combine all the movements together:\n- First, move 5 steps counter-clockwise (Fountain pen).\n- Then, move 7 steps counter-clockwise (Chime).\n- Finally, move 3 steps counter-clockwise (Confectionery store).\n\nSince we are moving counter-clockwise, we need to determine the net effect of these movements:\n- Total movement = 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 steps counter-clockwise.\n- Since the path has 10 dots, every 10 steps bring us back to the starting point. Therefore, 15 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to 5 steps counter-clockwise (since 15 mod 10 = 5).\n\nFrom our earlier calculation, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier lands us on the Fountain pen.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: Fountain pen.**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
