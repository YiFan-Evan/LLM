Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise means you go through all 10 elements and end up back at the obelisk. Therefore, the item you find is the obelisk.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the obelisk, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: The obelisk is the 5th element. Moving 1 step counter-clockwise takes you to the 4th element, which is the alligator lizard. Therefore, the item you find is the alligator lizard.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the obelisk, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: The obelisk is the 5th element. Moving 10 steps clockwise means you go through all 10 elements and end up back at the obelisk. Therefore, the item you find is the obelisk.\n\nNow, combining all these movements:\n\n1. Starting from the obelisk (5th element), moving 5 steps counter-clockwise lands you back at the obelisk.\n2. From the obelisk, moving 1 step counter-clockwise lands you at the alligator lizard (4th element).\n3. From the alligator lizard, moving 10 steps clockwise means you go through all 10 elements and end up back at the alligator lizard.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: alligator lizard."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
