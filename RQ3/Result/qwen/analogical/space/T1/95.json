What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The police van is the 4th element.\n- Moving 6 steps clockwise from the police van means moving past the spiny lobster, the cauliflower, the tricycle, the rapeseed, and the gas mask, landing on the palace.\n\n**Answer:** palace\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the police van, move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The police van is the 4th element.\n- Moving 4 steps clockwise from the police van means moving past the spiny lobster, the cauliflower, and the tricycle, landing on the rapeseed.\n\n**Answer:** rapeseed\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the police van, move around the ring by 6 steps and then by 4 steps in a clockwise direction.
