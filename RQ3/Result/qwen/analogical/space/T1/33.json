Let's define the positions clearly:\n\n1. **Top dot (starting point)** - Schooner\n2. **Clockwise from top**:\n   - 1st dot - Night Snake\n   - 2nd dot - Trombone\n   - 3rd dot - Cradle\n   - 4th dot - Garter Snake\n\nWe start at the Cradle (3rd dot). The next part of the problem involves two movements:\n- First, moving 2 steps clockwise.\n- Then, moving an additional 3 steps clockwise.\n\n### Problem 1: First Movement\nStarting from the Cradle (3rd dot), moving 2 steps clockwise:\n- Current Position: Cradle (3rd dot)\n- Move 1 step: Trombone (2nd dot)\n- Move 2 steps: Night Snake (1st dot)\n\nSo, after the first movement, you are at the Night Snake.\n\n### Problem 2: Second Movement\nNow, starting from the Night Snake (1st dot), moving 3 steps clockwise:\n- Current Position: Night Snake (1st dot)\n- Move 1 step: Trombone (2nd dot)\n- Move 2 steps: Cradle (3rd dot)\n- Move 3 steps: Garter Snake (4th dot)\n\nSo, after the second movement, you are at the Garter Snake.\n\n### Problem 3: Combined Movements\nCombining both movements into one sequence:\n- Starting from the Cradle (3rd dot):\n  - Move 2 steps: Night Snake (1st dot)\n  - From Night Snake (1st dot), move 3 steps: Garter Snake (4th dot)\n\nSo, after both movements combined, you are at the Garter Snake.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is: Garter Snake"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
