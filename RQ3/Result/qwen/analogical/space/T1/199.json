What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The oboe is at position 3.\n- Moving 1 step counter-clockwise means moving to position 2 (since we are moving backwards in the list).\n- The item at position 2 is a moving van.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 1 is: moving van.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the oboe, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction and then by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the oboe at position 3, moving 1 step counter-clockwise puts you at position 2 (moving van).\n- From the moving van, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise means moving back 6 positions from position 2.\n- Counting backward: position 2 -> 1 -> 20 -> 19 -> 18 -> 17 -> 16 -> 15.\n- The item at position 15 is a Geoffroy's spider monkey.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 2 is: Geoffroy's spider monkey.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the oboe, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the oboe at position 3, moving 1 step counter-clockwise puts you at position 2 (moving van).\n- From the moving van, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise puts you at position 15 (Geoffroy's spider monkey).\n- From the Geoffroy's spider monkey, moving 5 steps clockwise means moving forward 5 positions from position 15.\n- Counting forward: position 15 -> 16 -> 17 -> 18 -> 19 -> 20.\n- The item at position 20 is a barrel.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 3 is: barrel.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nNow let's apply the same logic to the original problem:\n\nStarting from the oboe, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally by 4 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from the oboe at position 3, moving 1 step counter-clockwise puts you at position 2 (moving van).\n- From the moving van, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise puts you at position 15 (Geoffroy's spider monkey).\n- From the Geoffroy's spider monkey, moving 5 steps clockwise puts you at position 20 (barrel).\n- From the barrel, moving 4 steps clockwise puts you at position 4.\n- Counting forward: position 20 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.\n- The item at position 4 is a swimming cap.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: swimming cap."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
