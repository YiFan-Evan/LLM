The sequence of dots moving counter-clockwise from the European green lizard is: Polar bear, Wool, Ice cream. Therefore, after moving 3 steps counter-clockwise, you will be at the Ice cream.\n\n### Solution 1:\nAfter moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the European green lizard, you will find an **Ice cream**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Ice cream (the position after the first movement), you then move 1 step clockwise. The sequence of dots moving clockwise from the Ice cream is: Spindle, Binoculars, Cliff dwelling, Submarine, Cockroach, Polar bear, Wool, Cucumber. Therefore, after moving 1 step clockwise, you will be at the Spindle.\n\n### Solution 2:\nAfter moving 1 step clockwise from the Ice cream, you will find a **Spindle**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the Spindle, you then move 8 steps clockwise. The sequence of dots moving clockwise from the Spindle is: Binoculars, Cliff dwelling, Submarine, Cockroach, Polar bear, Wool, Cucumber, European green lizard, Ice cream. Therefore, after moving 8 steps clockwise, you will be at the European green lizard.\n\n### Solution 3:\nAfter moving 8 steps clockwise from the Spindle, you will find a **European green lizard**.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nCombining all the movements:\n1. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the European green lizard to reach the Ice cream.\n2. Move 1 step clockwise from the Ice cream to reach the Spindle.\n3. Move 8 steps clockwise from the Spindle to reach the European green lizard.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **European green lizard**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
