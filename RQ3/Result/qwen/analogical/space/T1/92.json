Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the paper towel, you pass through the harvester, horse chestnut seed, snowmobile, race car, and stop at the remote control. Therefore, the item found is the remote control.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** Starting from the remote control, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** The remote control is the 4th element in the clockwise sequence starting from the Mexican hairless dog (top). Moving 10 steps clockwise from the remote control, you pass through the race car, snowmobile, paper towel, harvester, horse chestnut seed, boathouse, ox, and stop at the Mexican hairless dog. Therefore, the item found is the Mexican hairless dog.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** Starting from the paper towel, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** First, you move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the paper towel, landing on the remote control. Next, you move 10 steps clockwise from the remote control, landing on the Mexican hairless dog. Therefore, the item found is the Mexican hairless dog.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: Mexican hairless dog."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
