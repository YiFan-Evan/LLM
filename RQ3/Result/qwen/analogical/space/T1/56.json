Here are three related but not identical problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the upright piano, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\n1. Start at the upright piano.\n2. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Piano -> Goldfish -> Quail -> Old English Sheepdog -> Bluetick Coonhound -> Boxer -> Dust Jacket (since there are 10 positions and moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the piano lands you at the dust jacket).\n\nTherefore, the final answer for Problem 1 is: **Dust Jacket**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the upright piano, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\n1. Start at the upright piano.\n2. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Piano -> Goldfish -> Quail -> Bluetick Coonhound (since there are 10 positions and moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the piano lands you at the Bluetick Coonhound).\n\nTherefore, the final answer for Problem 2 is: **Bluetick Coonhound**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the upright piano, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\n1. Start at the upright piano.\n2. Move 4 steps clockwise.\n   - Piano -> Goldfish -> Quail -> Old English Sheepdog -> Boxer (since there are 10 positions and moving 4 steps clockwise from the piano lands you at the Boxer).\n\nTherefore, the final answer for Problem 3 is: **Boxer**.\n\n### Original Problem:\nStarting from the upright piano, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\n1. Start at the upright piano.\n2. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Piano -> Goldfish -> Quail -> Old English Sheepdog -> Bluetick Coonhound -> Boxer -> Dust Jacket.\n3. From the dust jacket, move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Dust Jacket -> Boxer -> Bluetick Coonhound -> Goldfish.\n4.
