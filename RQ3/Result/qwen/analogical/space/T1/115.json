Here are three related problems to illustrate the process:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the mantis, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Initial Position:** Mantis\n- **Movement:** 6 steps clockwise\n- **Path Elements:** Mantis, Pomegranate, Threshing Machine, Screw, Loupe, Microphone\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the mantis and moving 6 steps clockwise, the sequence is:\n1. Mantid (current)\n2. Pomegranate\n3. Threshing Machine\n4. Screw\n5. Loupe\n6. Microphone\n\nSo, after 6 steps, you land on the Microphone.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the microphone, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- **Initial Position:** Microphone\n- **Movement:** 8 steps counter-clockwise\n- **Path Elements:** Microphone, Parking Meter, Kit Fox, Paddle Wheel, Ear, Mantis, Pomegranate, Threshing Machine, Screw, Loupe\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the microphone and moving 8 steps counter-clockwise, the sequence is:\n1. Microphone (current)\n2. Parking Meter\n3. Kit Fox\n4. Paddle Wheel\n5. Ear\n6. Mantis\n7. Pomegranate\n8. Threshing Machine\n\nSo, after 8 steps, you land on the Threshing Machine.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the threshing machine, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- **Initial Position:** Threshing Machine\n- **Movement:** 6 steps counter-clockwise\n- **Path Elements:** Threshing Machine, Screw, Loupe, Microphone, Parking Meter, Kit Fox, Paddle Wheel, Ear, Mantis, Pomegranate\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the threshing machine and moving 6 steps counter-clockwise, the sequence is:\n1. Threshing Machine (current)\n2. Screw\n3. Loupe\n4. Microphone\n5. Parking Meter\n6. Kit Fox\n\nSo, after 6 steps, you land on the Kit Fox.\n\nNow, combining all the movements:\n1. From the mantis, move 6 steps clockwise to the microphone.\n2. From the microphone, move 8 steps counter-clockwise to the threshing machine.\n3. From the threshing machine, move 6 steps counter-clockwise to the kit fox.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Kit Fox"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
