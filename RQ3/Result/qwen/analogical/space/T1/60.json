Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the dhole lands you on the African rock python.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the new position (African rock python), you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: Moving 1 step clockwise from the African rock python brings you to the dome.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the dome, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the dome brings you to the Griffon Bruxellois.\n\nNow, let's summarize the entire sequence of movements:\n1. Start at the dhole.\n2. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise to the African rock python.\n3. Move 1 step clockwise to the dome.\n4.
