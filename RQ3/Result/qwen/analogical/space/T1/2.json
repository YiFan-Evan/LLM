Moving 3 steps clockwise from the Airedale Terrier lands you on the prairie grouse.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Airedale Terrier, move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: Since there are only 5 positions on the ring, moving 5 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving all the way around the circle back to the starting point. Therefore, you end up back at the Airedale Terrier.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the Airedale Terrier, move around the ring by 3 steps clockwise and then by 5 steps clockwise.\n- **Solution**: First, move 3 steps clockwise from the Airedale Terrier to reach the prairie grouse. Then, from the prairie grouse, move 5 steps clockwise. This is equivalent to moving all the way around the ring back to the prairie grouse (since 5 steps is a full circle).\n\nGiven these solutions, we can determine the final position after both movements:\n- Starting from the Airedale Terrier, moving 3 steps clockwise places you on the prairie grouse.\n- From the prairie grouse, moving 5 steps clockwise brings you back to the prairie grouse.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: prairie grouse"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
