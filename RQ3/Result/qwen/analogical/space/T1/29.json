What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nThe circular path consists of the following elements in order (starting from the top): \n1. Gossamer-winged butterfly\n2. Goblet\n3. Volcano\n4. Tiger\n5. Weasel\n\nMoving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger:\n- Step 1: Weasel\n- Step 2: Volcano\n- Step 3: Goblet\n- Step 4: Gossamer-winged butterfly\n\nSo, after moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger, you find the **gossamer-winged butterfly**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nNow, starting again from the tiger, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the tiger and moving 3 steps counter-clockwise:\n- Step 1: Weasel\n- Step 2: Volcano\n- Step 3: Goblet\n\nSo, after moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger, you find the **goblet**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFinally, consider starting from the tiger, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nFirst, move 4 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger:\n- Step 1: Weasel\n- Step 2: Volcano\n- Step 3: Goblet\n- Step 4: Gossamer-winged butterfly\n\nNow, starting from the gossamer-winged butterfly, move 3 steps counter-clockwise:\n- Step 1: Tiger\n- Step 2: Weasel\n- Step 3: Volcano\n\nSo, after moving 4 steps and then 3 more steps counter-clockwise from the tiger, you find the **volcano**.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the tiger, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.
