Moving 10 steps counterclockwise from the basketball means moving 10 steps counterclockwise from the basketball.\n    - Counting backwards from the basketball, the sequence is: lighthouse (9), hartebeest (8), Model T (7), miniskirt (6), pencil case (5), conch (4), pedestal (3), basketball (2), Sealyham Terrier (1), and finally the starting point (pencil case).\n  - Therefore, after moving 10 steps counterclockwise from the basketball, you would find yourself at the pencil case again.\n\n### Problem 3:\n- **Description**: Starting from the pencil case, you move 6 steps clockwise and then 10 steps counterclockwise. \n- **Solution**:\n  - As determined in Problems 1 and 2, moving 6 steps clockwise from the pencil case lands you on the basketball.\n  - Then, moving 10 steps counterclockwise from the basketball returns you to the pencil case.\n  \nTherefore, the final answer is: pencil case."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
