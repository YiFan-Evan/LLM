Starting from the dung beetle (6th element).\n2. Move 4 steps counter-clockwise: 6 - 4 = 2 (water buffalo).\n3. Move 4 steps counter-clockwise again: 2 - 4 = -2 (since we're on a circular path, -2 means moving 8 steps forward from the end): 10 - 2 = 8 (sidewinder).\n4. Move 10 steps clockwise: 8 + 10 = 18, which is equivalent to 18 mod 10 = 8 (sidewinder).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: sidewinder."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
