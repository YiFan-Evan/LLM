Moving clockwise, the items are a hair spray, a chickadee, a trilobite, and a French horn. Starting from the chickadee, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at the chickadee.\n- Move 1 step counter-clockwise: you reach the trilobite.\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the hair spray.\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the lynx.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: lynx.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou start at the top dot where there is a lynx. Moving clockwise, the items are a hair spray, a chickadee, a trilobite, and a French horn. Starting from the chickadee, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at the chickadee.\n- Move 1 step counter-clockwise: you reach the trilobite.\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the hair spray.\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the lynx.\n- Move 4 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the French horn.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: French horn.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou start at the top dot where there is a lynx. Moving clockwise, the items are a hair spray, a chickadee, a trilobite, and a French horn. Starting from the chickadee, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at the chickadee.\n- Move 1 step counter-clockwise: you reach the trilobite.\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the hair spray.\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the lynx.\n- Move 4 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the French horn.\n- Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the trilobite again (since 5 steps lands you back at the trilobite).\n- Move 6 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the hair spray again (since 6 steps lands you back at the hair spray).\n- Therefore, the final answer is: hair spray.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the chickadee, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise:\n\n- Move 1 step counter-clockwise: you reach the trilobite.\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the hair spray.\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the lynx.\n- Move 4 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the French horn.\n- Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: you reach the chickadee again (since 5 steps lands you back at the chickadee).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: chickadee."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
