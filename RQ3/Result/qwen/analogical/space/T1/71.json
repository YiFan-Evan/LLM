Starting from the dog sled (top), moving 1 step clockwise lands you on the barn. Therefore, the item you find is the barn.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the dog sled, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction again.\n\n- **Solution**: Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the dog sled lands you on the red-breasted merganser. Moving another 2 steps counter-clockwise from the red-breasted merganser lands you on the promontory. Therefore, the item you find is the promontory.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the dog sled, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 2 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution**: Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the dog sled lands you on the red-breasted merganser. Moving 2 steps clockwise from the red-breasted merganser lands you on the Asian elephant. Therefore, the item you find is the Asian elephant.\n\n### Original Problem:\nStarting from the dog sled, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally by 2 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n- **Solution**: \n  - Moving 9 steps counter-clockwise from the dog sled is the same as moving 1 step clockwise, which lands you on the barn.\n  - Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the barn lands you on the red-breasted merganser.\n  - Moving 2 steps clockwise from the red-breasted merganser lands you on the Asian elephant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Asian elephant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
