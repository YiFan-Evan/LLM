What do you find?\n\n- **Solution**: \n  - Starting position: Afghan Hound.\n  - Moving 1 step clockwise: Chainsaw.\n  - Moving 2 steps clockwise: Split-rail Fence.\n  - Moving 3 steps clockwise: Crash Helmet.\n  \n  Therefore, the item found is a Crash Helmet.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Afghan Hound, move 7 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - Starting position: Afghan Hound.\n  - Moving 1 step clockwise: Chainsaw.\n  - Moving 2 steps clockwise: Split-rail Fence.\n  - Moving 3 steps clockwise: Crash Helmet.\n  - Moving 4 steps clockwise: Monitor.\n  - Moving 5 steps clockwise: Wall Clock.\n  - Moving 6 steps clockwise: Howler Monkey.\n  - Moving 7 steps clockwise: Marmot.\n  \n  Therefore, the item found is a Marmot.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the Afghan Hound, move 10 steps clockwise.
