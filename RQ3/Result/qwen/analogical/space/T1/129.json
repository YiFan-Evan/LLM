The circular path consists of 20 dots, so every 20 steps will bring us back to the starting point.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the padlock, you move around the ring by 13 steps in a clockwise direction. \n\n**Solution:**\n- Padlock is the 20th dot.\n- Moving 13 steps clockwise from the 20th dot lands you on the 13th dot (since 20 - 13 = 7, and moving forward 13 steps from 20 is equivalent to moving 7 steps backward from 1, which brings you to the 13th dot).\n- The 13th dot contains a soccer ball.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the soccer ball, you move around the ring by 19 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The soccer ball is the 13th dot.\n- Moving 19 steps counter-clockwise from the 13th dot is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (since 19 steps counter-clockwise is the same as 1 step clockwise on a 20-dot circle).\n- Moving 1 step clockwise from the 13th dot brings you to the 14th dot.\n- The 14th dot contains a gorilla.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the gorilla, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The gorilla is the 14th dot.\n- Moving 7 steps clockwise from the 14th dot lands you on the 1st dot (since 14 + 7 = 21, and 21 modulo 20 is 1).\n- The 1st dot contains an abacus.\n\n### Final Movement:\nFrom the abacus, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The abacus is the 1st dot.\n- Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the 1st dot is equivalent to moving 14 steps clockwise (since 6 steps counter-clockwise is the same as 14 steps clockwise on a 20-dot circle).\n- Moving 14 steps clockwise from the 1st dot brings you to the 15th dot (since 1 + 14 = 15).\n- The 15th dot contains an eel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: eel"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
