Start at the beaver.\n2. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise, which lands you on the Great Dane.\n3. Move 5 steps clockwise from the Great Dane, which lands you on the rotary dial telephone.\n4. Move 1 step clockwise from the rotary dial telephone, which lands you on the Mexican hairless dog.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Mexican hairless dog"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
