Moving 3 steps clockwise from the platypus would place you at the sea lion.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the sea lion (after moving 3 steps from the platypus), you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** From the sea lion, moving 1 step clockwise places you at the golf cart.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the golf cart (after moving 1 step clockwise from the sea lion), you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** From the golf cart, moving 1 step counter-clockwise places you back at the sea lion.\n\nNow, combining these movements:\n- Start at the platypus.\n- Move 3 steps clockwise to reach the sea lion.\n- Move 1 step clockwise to reach the golf cart.\n- Move 1 step counter-clockwise to return to the sea lion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: sea lion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
