What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Black Swan.\n- Movement: 2 steps clockwise.\n- Path sequence: Black Swan -> Bagel -> Weimaraner.\n- Therefore, after moving 2 steps clockwise from the black swan, you find the Weimaraner.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the black swan, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Black Swan.\n- Movement: 3 steps clockwise.\n- Path sequence: Black Swan -> Bagel -> Weimaraner -> Football Helmet.\n- Therefore, after moving 3 steps clockwise from the black swan, you find the Football Helmet.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the black swan, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Black Swan.\n- Movement: 4 steps clockwise.\n- Path sequence: Black Swan -> Bagel -> Weimaraner -> Football Helmet -> Chainsaw.\n- Therefore, after moving 4 steps clockwise from the black swan, you find the Chainsaw.\n\n### Original Problem:\nStarting from the black swan, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Black Swan.\n- Movement: 5 steps clockwise.\n- Path sequence: Black Swan -> Bagel -> Weimaraner -> Football Helmet -> Chainsaw -> Weimaraner.\n- Since moving 5 steps from the black swan lands you exactly back at the starting point of the circle (as there are only 5 points), you end up at the Weimaraner again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Weimaraner."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
