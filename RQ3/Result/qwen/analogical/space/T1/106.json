Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the stick insect, you move 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Stick insect.\n- Move 2 steps clockwise: Stick insect -> Weimaraner -> Acorn.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: Acorn.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the chambered nautilus, you move 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Chambered nautilus.\n- Move 3 steps clockwise: Chambered nautilus -> Turnstile -> Wine bottle -> Hot pot.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: Hot pot.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the trilobite, you move 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Trilobite.\n- Move 4 steps counter-clockwise: Trilobite -> Hot pot -> Wine bottle -> Turnstile -> Chambered nautilus.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: Chambered nautilus.\n\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\n\nStarting from the chambered nautilus, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. \n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Chambered nautilus.\n- First movement (1 step counter-clockwise): Chambered nautilus -> Basenji.\n- Second movement (8 steps counter-clockwise): Basenji -> Turnstile (since moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from Basenji brings you back to the same position as moving 2 steps clockwise from Basenji).\n- Third movement (8 steps counter-clockwise): Turnstile -> Basenji (since moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from Turnstile brings you back to the same position as moving 2 steps clockwise from Turnstile).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Basenji."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
