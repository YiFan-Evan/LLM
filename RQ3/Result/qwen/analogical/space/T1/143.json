What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Dugong is at position 14 (assuming positions are numbered from 0 to 19).\n- Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from dugong: \\(14 - 8 = 6\\). \n- The item at position 6 is a hot pot.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 1 is: hot pot.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the dugong, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start from dugong at position 14.\n- Move 8 steps counter-clockwise: \\(14 - 8 = 6\\).\n- From position 6, move 2 steps counter-clockwise: \\(6 - 2 = 4\\).\n- The item at position 4 is a centipede.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 2 is: centipede.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the dugong, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start from dugong at position 14.\n- Move 8 steps counter-clockwise: \\(14 - 8 = 6\\).\n- From position 6, move 2 steps counter-clockwise: \\(6 - 2 = 4\\).\n- From position 4, move 5 steps clockwise: \\(4 + 5 = 9\\).\n- The item at position 9 is a Boston Terrier.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 3 is: Boston Terrier.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nNow, starting from the dugong and performing all the specified moves:\n\n1. **Move 8 steps counter-clockwise:** \n   - Start at dugong at position 14.\n   - \\(14 - 8 = 6\\).\n   - Item at position 6 is a hot pot.\n\n2. **Move 2 steps counter-clockwise:** \n   - From position 6, move 2 steps counter-clockwise: \\(6 - 2 = 4\\).\n   - Item at position 4 is a centipede.\n\n3. **Move 5 steps clockwise:** \n   - From position 4, move 5 steps clockwise: \\(4 + 5 = 9\\).\n   - Item at position 9 is a Boston Terrier.\n\n4. **Move 16 steps clockwise:** \n   - From position 9, move 16 steps clockwise: \\(9 + 16 = 25\\). Since there are only 20 positions, \\(25 \\mod 20 = 5\\).\n   - Item at position 5 is a ruffed grouse.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ruffed grouse."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
