Here are three related problems:\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the green mamba, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The green mamba is the 15th element.\n- Moving 15 steps clockwise from the green mamba (15th element) brings you to the 30th element.\n- Since there are only 20 elements, we wrap around using modulo 20.\n- \\( 30 \\mod 20 = 10 \\)\n- The 10th element is a stone wall.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 1 is: stone wall.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the stone wall, you then move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The stone wall is the 10th element.\n- Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the 10th element brings you to the 4th element.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 2 is: warthog.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the warthog, you move around the ring by 17 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The warthog is the 4th element.\n- Moving 17 steps clockwise from the 4th element brings you to the 21st element.\n- \\( 21 \\mod 20 = 1 \\)\n- The 1st element is a pencil sharpener.\n- Therefore, the final answer for Problem 3 is: pencil sharpener.\n\nNow, let's consider the final movement:\n### Final Movement:\nFrom the pencil sharpener, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The pencil sharpener is the 1st element.\n- Moving 10 steps clockwise from the 1st element brings you to the 11th element.\n- The 11th element is a koala.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: koala."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
