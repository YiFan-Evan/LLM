Starting from the home theater and moving 2 steps clockwise brings you to the kimono.\n\n**Problem 2:** From the kimono, you then move 10 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** Moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from the kimono is equivalent to moving 10 steps backward on the circular path. Since the path has 20 dots, moving 10 steps back from the kimono lands you on the eastern diamondback rattlesnake.\n\n**Problem 3:** From the eastern diamondback rattlesnake, you move 6 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the eastern diamondback rattlesnake brings you to the corkscrew.\n\nNow, considering the final movement:\n- **Final Movement:** From the corkscrew, you move 19 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** Moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (because 20 - 19 = 1).
