The elements in order starting from the chiton are a spiny lobster, a ringlet, a honeycomb, a limpkin, a potter's wheel, an Appenzeller Sennenhund, a tights, and a European garden spider. After moving 8 steps clockwise, what do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the chiton and moving 8 steps clockwise, you pass through the spiny lobster, ringlet, honeycomb, limpkin, potter's wheel, Appenzeller Sennenhund, and tights.
