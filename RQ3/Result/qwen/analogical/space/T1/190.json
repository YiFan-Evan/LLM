So, we count forward 5 steps from the Tabby Cat:\n  - 1 step: Couch\n  - 2 steps: Shopping Cart\n  - 3 steps: Bath Towel\n  - 4 steps: Black-Footed Ferret\n  - 5 steps: Tabby Cat\n\nSo, after moving 15 steps counter-clockwise, you still land on the Couch.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the Couch, move 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n- Starting from the Couch, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise:\n  - 1 step: Shopping Cart\n  - 2 steps: Bath Towel\n  - 3 steps: Black-Footed Ferret\n  - 4 steps: Tabby Cat\n  - 5 steps: Couch (already counted)\n  - 6 steps: Couch (still counting backwards)\n  - 7 steps: Couch (still counting backwards)\n  - 8 steps: Couch (still counting backwards)\n  - 9 steps: Couch (still counting backwards)\n  - 10 steps: Couch (still counting backwards)\n  - 11 steps: Couch (still counting backwards)\n  - 12 steps: Couch (still counting backwards)\n  - 13 steps: Couch (still counting backwards)\n\nSince the circle has 20 dots, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 7 steps clockwise. So, we count forward 7 steps from the Couch:\n  - 1 step: Shopping Cart\n  - 2 steps: Bath Towel\n  - 3 steps: Black-Footed Ferret\n  - 4 steps: Tabby Cat\n  - 5 steps: Couch\n  - 6 steps: Couch\n  - 7 steps: Couch\n\nSo, after moving 13 steps counter-clockwise, you still land on the Shopping Cart.\n\nFinally, from the Shopping Cart, move 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n- Starting from the Shopping Cart, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise:\n  - 1 step: Bath Towel\n  - 2 steps: Black-Footed Ferret\n  - 3 steps: Tabby Cat\n  - 4 steps: Couch\n  - 5 steps: Shopping Cart (already counted)\n  - 6 steps: Shopping Cart (still counting backwards)\n  - 7 steps: Shopping Cart (still counting backwards)\n  - 8 steps: Shopping Cart (still counting backwards)\n\nSince the circle has 20 dots, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 12 steps clockwise. So, we count forward 12 steps from the Shopping Cart:\n  - 1 step: Bath Towel\n  - 2 steps: Black-Footed Ferret\n  - 3 steps: Tabby Cat\n  - 4 steps: Couch\n  - 5 steps: Shopping Cart\n  - 6 steps: Bath Towel\n  - 7 steps: Black-Footed Ferret\n  - 8 steps: Tabby Cat\n  - 9 steps: Couch\n  - 10 steps: Shopping Cart\n  - 11 steps: Bath Towel\n  - 12 steps: Black-Footed Ferret\n\nSo, after moving 8 steps counter-clockwise, you land on the Black-Footed Ferret.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Black-Footed Ferret"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
