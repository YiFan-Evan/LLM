Here are three such problems:\n\n1. **Problem**: You start at the dot where the night snake is located. You move 3 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n   - **Solution**: Starting from the night snake, moving 3 steps clockwise brings you to the rocking chair.\n   - **Answer**: rocking chair\n\n2. **Problem**: You start at the dot where the albatross is located. You move 7 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n   - **Solution**: Since the path has 5 dots, moving 7 steps is equivalent to moving 2 steps (because 7 mod 5 = 2). Starting from the albatross, moving 2 steps clockwise brings you to the bathtub.\n   - **Answer**: bathtub\n\n3. **Problem**: You start at the dot where the pickup truck is located. You move 4 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n   - **Solution**: Starting from the pickup truck, moving 4 steps clockwise brings you to the rocking chair.\n   - **Answer**: rocking chair\n\nNow, solving the original problem:\n\n- **Original Problem**: Starting from the pickup truck, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n- **Solution**: Starting from the pickup truck, moving 5 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 0 steps (because 5 mod 5 = 0).
