What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The sequence starts with the breakwater.\n- Moving counter-clockwise, the positions before breakwater (going backwards) would be suspension bridge, sea slug, chainsaw, lawn mower, dunlin, coucal, and toilet paper.\n- After moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from breakwater, you land on toilet paper.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the toilet paper, you move around the ring by 16 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from toilet paper, moving 16 steps clockwise means moving past the Flat-Coated Retriever, Bloodhound, notebook computer, bee eater, cockroach, garfish, Italian Greyhound, Granny Smith, baluster, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and then landing back on the Bloodhound again (since there are only 20 positions and moving 16 steps lands you on the 17th position from toilet paper, which is Bloodhound).\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the Bloodhound, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting from Bloodhound, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise means moving past the notebook computer, bee eater, cockroach, garfish, Italian Greyhound, Granny Smith, and landing on the baluster.\n\nNow, combining all these movements:\n\n- Starting from the breakwater, move 8 steps counter-clockwise: toilet paper.\n- From toilet paper, move 16 steps clockwise: Bloodhound.\n- From Bloodhound, move 7 steps counter-clockwise: baluster.\n- From baluster, move 13 steps counter-clockwise: landing on the sea slug.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: sea slug."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
