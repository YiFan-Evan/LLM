Moving 15 steps clockwise from the plate rack means moving past the soup bowl (10th), menu (11th), rifle (12th), typewriter keyboard (13th), American dipper (14th), garter snake (1st), green mamba (2nd), stethoscope (3rd), tailed frog (4th), tench (5th), waste container (6th), paper towel (7th), and school bus (8th). The 15th step lands you on the monastery (10th element + 5 steps = 15th position).\n\n**Answer:** monastery\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the monastery, you move around the ring by 14 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe monastery is the 9th element. Moving 14 steps clockwise from the monastery means moving past the plate rack (10th), Miniature Pinscher (11th), box turtle (12th), pretzel (13th), Pyrenean Mountain Dog (14th), soup bowl (15th), menu (16th), rifle (17th), typewriter keyboard (18th), American dipper (19th), garter snake (20th), green mamba (1st), stethoscope (2nd), and landing on the tailed frog (3rd).\n\n**Answer:** tailed frog\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the tailed frog, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe tailed frog is the 4th element. Moving 8 steps clockwise from the tailed frog means moving past the tench (5th), waste container (6th), paper towel (7th), school bus (8th), monastery (9th), plate rack (10th), Miniature Pinscher (11th), and box turtle (12th), landing on the pretzel (13th).\n\n**Answer:** pretzel\n\n### Final Movement:\nFrom the pretzel, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe pretzel is the 13th element. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means moving back past the box turtle (12th), Miniature Pinscher (11th), and plate rack (10th), landing on the soup bowl (9th).\n\n**Answer:** soup bowl\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: soup bowl"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
