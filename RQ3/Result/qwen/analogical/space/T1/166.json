Let's break down the problem into simpler steps:\n\n### Problem 1:\nYou start at the Maltese and move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n- **Solution**: \n  - Starting at the Maltese, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means moving back to the Cardigan Welsh Corgi.\n  - Therefore, the item found is the Cardigan Welsh Corgi.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, you move 19 steps clockwise.\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - Starting from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi, moving 19 steps clockwise means you effectively move 1 step counter-clockwise (since 19 steps clockwise is equivalent to 1 step counter-clockwise on a 20-dot circle).\n  - Therefore, you end up at the Bustard.\n  - The item found is the Bustard.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the Bustard, you move 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - Starting from the Bustard, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise means moving back to the Border Terrier.\n  - Therefore, the item found is the Border Terrier.\n\n### Final Movement:\nFrom the Border Terrier, you move 9 steps clockwise.\n\n- **Solution**:\n  - Starting from the Border Terrier, moving 9 steps clockwise means moving to the Scooter.\n  - Therefore, the final answer is: Scooter."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
