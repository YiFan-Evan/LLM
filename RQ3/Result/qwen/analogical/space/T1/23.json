You move 2 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the pig, moving 2 steps clockwise means moving past the bee and stopping at the sock. Therefore, the final answer is: sock.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou are positioned on the dot where the Basset Hound is located. You move 1 step counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the Basset Hound, moving 1 step counter-clockwise means moving to the smooth newt. Therefore, the final answer is: smooth newt.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou are positioned on the dot where the bee is located. You move 4 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the bee, moving 4 steps clockwise means moving past the sock, the smooth newt, and the Basset Hound, and ending up back at the bee. Therefore, the final answer is: bee.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the Basset Hound, you move 3 steps clockwise. This brings you to the smooth newt. Then, you move 4 steps counter-clockwise from the smooth newt. Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the smooth newt brings you back to the Basset Hound (since moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the smooth newt would bring you to the Basset Hound, and then you would complete the remaining 3 steps).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Basset Hound."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
