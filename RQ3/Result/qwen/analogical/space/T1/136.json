We'll also create similar problems to understand the concept better.\n\n### Problem 1:\nYou start at the golf ball and move 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting at the golf ball, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means moving to the crate (since the sequence in reverse order is: backpack, chambered nautilus, jacamar, ant, otter, dome, trimaran, brass, airliner, electric locomotive, pirate ship, Granny Smith, Old English Sheepdog, Border Terrier, lotion, crate). Therefore, the final answer is: crate.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou start at the golf ball and move 7 steps in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting at the golf ball, moving 7 steps clockwise means moving to the Granny Smith (since the sequence is: golf ball, flamingo, bow tie, crate, lotion, Border Terrier, Old English Sheepdog, Granny Smith). Therefore, the final answer is: Granny Smith.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou start at the golf ball and move 19 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting at the golf ball, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise means moving to the lotion (since moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise due to the circular nature of the map, and moving 1 step clockwise from the golf ball leads to the flamingo, then to the bow tie, and finally to the crate, lotion). Therefore, the final answer is: lotion.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting at the golf ball, you move 8 steps counter-clockwise, then 5 steps clockwise, then 16 steps clockwise, and finally 14 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n1. **First Movement:** Move 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - The sequence in reverse order is: backpack, chambered nautilus, jacamar, ant, otter, dome, trimaran, brass, airliner, electric locomotive, pirate ship, Granny Smith, Old English Sheepdog, Border Terrier, lotion, crate.\n   - Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the golf ball lands you on the lotion.\n\n2. **Second Movement:** Move 5 steps clockwise from the lotion.\n   - The sequence from the lotion is: lotion, Border Terrier, Old English Sheepdog, Granny Smith, pirate ship, electric locomotive, airliner, brass, trimaran, dome, otter, ant, jacamar, chambered nautilus, backpack, golf ball, flamingo, bow tie, crate.\n   - Moving 5 steps clockwise from the lotion lands you on the pirate ship.\n\n3. **Third Movement:** Move 16 steps clockwise from the pirate ship.\n   - The sequence from the pirate ship is: pirate ship, electric locomotive, airliner, brass, trimaran, dome, otter, ant, jacamar, chambered nautilus, backpack, golf ball, flamingo, bow tie, crate, lotion, Border Terrier, Old English Sheepdog, Granny Smith.\n   - Moving 16 steps clockwise from the pirate ship lands you on the crate.\n\n4. **Fourth Movement:** Move 14 steps counter-clockwise from the crate.\n   - The sequence in reverse order is: backpack, chambered nautilus, jacamar, ant, otter, dome, trimaran, brass, airliner, electric locomotive, pirate ship, Granny Smith, Old English Sheepdog, Border Terrier, lotion, crate.\n   - Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise from the crate lands you on the brass.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: brass."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
