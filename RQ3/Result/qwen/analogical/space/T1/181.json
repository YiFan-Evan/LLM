What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the apiary and moving 6 steps counter-clockwise, we count backwards through the list:\n- Apiary (starting point)\n- Jackfruit\n- Fountain\n- Agaric\n- Breastplate\n- An American alligator\n\nTherefore, after 6 steps counter-clockwise, you find an American alligator.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou then move 10 steps in a clockwise direction from the American alligator. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the American alligator and moving 10 steps clockwise, we count forward through the list:\n- American alligator (starting point)\n- A hen\n- An apiary\n- A breastplate\n- An agaric\n- A fountain\n- A jackfruit\n- A mink\n- A Cocker Spaniels\n- A snail\n\nTherefore, after 10 steps clockwise, you find a snail.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFinally, you move 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the snail.
