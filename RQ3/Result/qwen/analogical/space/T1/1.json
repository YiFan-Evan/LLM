You move 3 steps clockwise. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at the shower cap.\n- Move 1 step clockwise to the Angora rabbit.\n- Move another step clockwise to the swimsuit.\n- Move another step clockwise to the earth star.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: earth star.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou are positioned on the dot where the Angora rabbit is located.
