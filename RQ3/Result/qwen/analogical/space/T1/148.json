Here are three related problems:\n\n**Problem 1:** \nYou are initially at the dot with the Pickelhaube. Moving clockwise, the elements are a syringe, a bobsleigh, a Maltese, a spider web, a tiger cat, a Boston Terrier, an indri, a Geoffroy's spider monkey, a website, a wardrobe, a Saharan horned viper, a kimono, a Wire Fox Terrier, a cowboy hat, a sliding door, a scarf, a tool kit, and a French Bulldog. If you move 5 steps clockwise, what do you find?\n\n**Solution 1:** \nStarting at the Pickelhaube, moving 5 steps clockwise lands you on the tiger cat.\n\n**Problem 2:** \nYou are initially at the dot with the Pickelhaube. Moving counter-clockwise, the elements are a French Bulldog, a tool kit, a scarf, a sliding door, a cowboy hat, a Wire Fox Terrier, a kimono, a Saharan horned viper, a wardrobe, a website, a Geoffroy's spider monkey, an indri, a Boston Terrier, a tiger cat, a spider web, a Maltese, a bobsleigh, and a syringe. If you move 15 steps counter-clockwise, what do you find?\n\n**Solution 2:** \nStarting at the Pickelhaube, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the tiger cat.\n\n**Problem 3:** \nYou are initially at the dot with the Pickelhaube.
