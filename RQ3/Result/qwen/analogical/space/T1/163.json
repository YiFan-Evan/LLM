What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Soap dispenser.\n- Movements: 5 steps clockwise.\n- Sequence: Soap dispenser \u2192 Chainsaw \u2192 Front curtain \u2192 Drilling rig \u2192 Cradle \u2192 Tandem bicycle.\n\nTherefore, after moving 5 steps clockwise from the soap dispenser, you will find a **Tandem bicycle**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the soap dispenser, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Soap dispenser.\n- Movements: 10 steps clockwise.\n- Sequence: Soap dispenser \u2192 Chainsaw \u2192 Front curtain \u2192 Drilling rig \u2192 Cradle \u2192 Tandem bicycle \u2192 Vacuum cleaner \u2192 Borzoi \u2192 King Charles Spaniel \u2192 Greater Swiss Mountain Dog \u2192 Fiddler crab.\n\nTherefore, after moving 10 steps clockwise from the soap dispenser, you will find a **Fiddler crab**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the soap dispenser, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Soap dispenser.\n- Movements: 15 steps clockwise.\n- Sequence: Soap dispenser \u2192 Chainsaw \u2192 Front curtain \u2192 Drilling rig \u2192 Cradle \u2192 Tandem bicycle \u2192 Vacuum cleaner \u2192 Borzoi \u2192 King Charles Spaniel \u2192 Greater Swiss Mountain Dog \u2192 Fiddler crab \u2192 Bittern \u2192 Consomme \u2192 Hand plane \u2192 Water snake \u2192 Apiary.\n\nTherefore, after moving 15 steps clockwise from the soap dispenser, you will find an **Apiary**.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the soap dispenser, you move around the ring by 20 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Starting position: Soap dispenser.\n- Movements: 20 steps clockwise.\n- Since there are only 20 positions on the circle, moving 20 steps clockwise will bring you back to the starting position, which is the soap dispenser.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Soap dispenser**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
