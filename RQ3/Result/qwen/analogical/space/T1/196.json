Since there are only 20 positions, we take \\(27 \\mod 20 = 7\\).\n- Therefore, after moving 18 steps clockwise, you are at position 7, which corresponds to a spoonbill.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the spoonbill, move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction.\n\n- The spoonbill is at position 7.\n- Moving 1 step clockwise from position 7: \\(7 + 1 = 8\\).\n- Therefore, after moving 1 step clockwise, you are at position 8, which corresponds to a water tower.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the water tower, move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- The water tower is at position 8.\n- Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from position 8: \\(8 - 2 = 6\\).\n- Therefore, after moving 2 steps counter-clockwise, you are at position 6, which corresponds to a plow.\n\n### Final Movement:\nFrom the plow, move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n- The plow is at position 6.\n- Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from position 6: \\(6 - 1 = 5\\).\n- Therefore, after moving 1 step counter-clockwise, you are at position 5, which corresponds to a safety pin.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: safety pin."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
