What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The harvester is followed by a Newfoundland.\n- Moving 4 steps clockwise from the harvester, you pass through the Newfoundland, chocolate syrup, and plate, landing on the ladybug.\n- Therefore, the final item found after moving 4 steps clockwise from the harvester is the ladybug.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the ladybug, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The ladybug is followed by an American robin.\n- Moving 18 steps clockwise from the ladybug means passing through the American robin, toy terrier, Windsor tie, Clumber Spaniel, grey wolf, park bench, sunglasses, smooth newt, smooth green snake, soap dispenser, combination lock, three-toed sloth, and rain barrel, and then landing back on the altar (since there are 20 dots in total, moving 18 steps lands you 2 steps before the starting point, which is the altar).\n- Therefore, the final item found after moving 18 steps clockwise from the ladybug is the altar.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the altar, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The altar is followed by a harvester.\n- Moving 6 steps clockwise from the altar means passing through the harvester, Newfoundland, chocolate syrup, and plate, landing on the ladybug.\n- Therefore, the final item found after moving 6 steps clockwise from the altar is the ladybug.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nNow, let's solve the original problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:** Starting from the harvester.\n2. **First Movement:** Move 4 steps clockwise. As solved above, you land on the ladybug.\n3. **Second Movement:** Move 18 steps clockwise from the ladybug. As solved above, you land on the altar.\n4. **Third Movement:** Move 6 steps clockwise from the altar. As solved above, you land on the ladybug.\n5. **Fourth Movement:** Move 16 steps clockwise from the ladybug. Moving 16 steps clockwise from the ladybug means passing through the American robin, toy terrier, Windsor tie, Clumber Spaniel, grey wolf, park bench, sunglasses, smooth newt, smooth green snake, soap dispenser, combination lock, three-toed sloth, and rain barrel, and then landing on the muzzle (since there are 20 dots in total, moving 16 steps lands you 4 steps before the starting point, which is the muzzle).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: muzzle"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
