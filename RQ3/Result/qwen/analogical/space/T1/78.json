What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The vestment is at position 4 (considering the gong as position 0).\n- Moving 5 steps clockwise from the vestment brings you to the position of the front curtain.\n- Therefore, the item you find is the front curtain.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the vestment, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The vestment is at position 4.\n- Moving 8 steps clockwise from the vestment brings you to the position of the beaker.\n- Therefore, the item you find is the beaker.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the vestment, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The vestment is at position 4.\n- Moving 3 steps clockwise from the vestment brings you to the position of the coyote.\n- Therefore, the item you find is the coyote.\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the vestment, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\n- The vestment is at position 4.\n- Moving 10 steps clockwise from the vestment brings you back to the same position because the path has 10 dots.\n- Therefore, you end up at the position of the vestment again.\n- Therefore, the final answer is: vestment"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
