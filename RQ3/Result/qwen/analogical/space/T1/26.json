So, starting from the velvet and moving 5 steps clockwise, you return to the velvet.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: Starting from the Welsh Springer Spaniel, you move 7 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution**: Moving 7 steps clockwise from the Welsh Springer Spaniel is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise (since 7 mod 5 = 2). Therefore, you end up at the switch.\n\nNow, combining both movements:\n- First movement: 2 steps counter-clockwise \u2192 velvet.\n- Second movement: 5 steps clockwise \u2192 velvet.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: velvet"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
