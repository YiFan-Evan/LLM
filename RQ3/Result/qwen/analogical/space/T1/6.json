Thus, you would be on the strainer.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** From the strainer, you then move 3 steps clockwise.\n- Initial Position: Strainer\n- Movement: 3 steps clockwise\n- Possible positions after movement: Ruffed grouse (as the strainer is followed by the perfume, then the ruffed grouse).\n\n**Solution:** After moving 3 steps clockwise from the strainer, you land on the ruffed grouse.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** You start at the four-poster bed, move 2 steps counter-clockwise, and then move 3 steps clockwise.\n- Initial Position: Four-poster bed\n- Movement: First 2 steps counter-clockwise, then 3 steps clockwise\n- Possible positions after combined movement: From the bed to the strainer (2 steps counter-clockwise), and then 3 steps clockwise lands you on the ruffed grouse.\n\n**Solution:** Combining both movements, you end up on the ruffed grouse.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: ruffed grouse."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
