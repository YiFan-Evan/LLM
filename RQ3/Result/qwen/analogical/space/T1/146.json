Let's break down the problem into simpler parts and create similar problems for clarity.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the oxygen mask, move 8 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The oxygen mask is the second dot.\n- Moving 8 steps clockwise means moving to the 10th dot (oxygen mask + 8).\n- The 10th dot contains a monarch butterfly.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom the monarch butterfly, move 6 steps counter-clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The monarch butterfly is the 10th dot.\n- Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise means moving to the 4th dot (monarch butterfly - 6).\n- The 4th dot contains a small white.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom the small white, move 17 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The small white is the 4th dot.\n- Moving 17 steps clockwise means moving to the 21st dot, which wraps around to the 1st dot (small white + 17).\n- The 1st dot contains a strainer.\n\nNow, let's combine all these movements together starting from the oxygen mask:\n\n1. Move 8 steps clockwise from the oxygen mask (2nd dot): Monarch butterfly.\n2. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise from the monarch butterfly (10th dot): Small white.\n3. Move 17 steps clockwise from the small white (4th dot): Strainer.\n4. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise from the strainer (1st dot): Oxygen mask.\n\nAfter these movements, you end up back at the oxygen mask. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: oxygen mask.**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
