Badger -> Monastery (1 step)\n2. Monastery -> American alligator (2 steps)\n3. American alligator -> Lionfish (3 steps)\n4. Lionfish -> Eastern hog-nosed snake (4 steps)\n5. Eastern hog-nosed snake -> Conch (5 steps)\n6. Conch -> Stone wall (6 steps)\n\n**Final Position**: Stone wall\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: You start at the stone wall and move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Starting Position**: Stone wall\n- **Movement**: 3 steps counter-clockwise\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Stone wall -> Conch (1 step)\n2. Conch -> Eastern hog-nosed snake (2 steps)\n3. Eastern hog-nosed snake -> Lionfish (3 steps)\n\n**Final Position**: Lionfish\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: You start at the lionfish and move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Starting Position**: Lionfish\n- **Movement**: 3 steps counter-clockwise\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Lionfish -> Eastern hog-nosed snake (1 step)\n2. Eastern hog-nosed snake -> Conch (2 steps)\n3. Conch -> Stone wall (3 steps)\n\n**Final Position**: Stone wall\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the badger, you move:\n1. 6 steps counter-clockwise -> Stone wall\n2. 3 steps counter-clockwise -> Lionfish\n3. 3 steps counter-clockwise -> Stone wall\n\n**Final Position**: Stone wall\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Stone wall"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
