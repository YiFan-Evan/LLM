What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the European garden spider (position 15), moving 11 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards on the circular path. The path has 20 positions, so moving 11 steps back is equivalent to moving \\(20 - 11 = 9\\) steps forward. Thus, we move 9 steps clockwise from the European garden spider.\n\nStarting position: European garden spider (position 15)\nMove 9 steps forward: Position 15 + 9 = 24 (which is equivalent to position 4 because 24 mod 20 = 4)\nItem at position 4: Shoji\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou are at the European garden spider and move 11 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the European garden spider (position 15), moving 11 steps clockwise:\n\nStarting position: European garden spider (position 15)\nMove 11 steps forward: Position 15 + 11 = 26 (which is equivalent to position 6 because 26 mod 20 = 6)\nItem at position 6: Agama\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou are at the European garden spider and move 11 steps counter-clockwise, then move 11 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nFirst, move 11 steps counter-clockwise from the European garden spider (position 15):\nMove 11 steps back: Position 15 - 11 = 4 (which is equivalent to position 4 because 4 is already within the range)\n\nNow, starting from position 4 (shoji), move 11 steps clockwise:\nPosition 4 + 11 = 15 (which is equivalent to position 15 because 15 is already within the range)\nItem at position 15: European garden spider\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: European garden spider"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
