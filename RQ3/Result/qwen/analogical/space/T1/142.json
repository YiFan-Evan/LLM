From the trimaran, move 8 steps counter-clockwise (final position: drilling rig).\n2. From the drilling rig, move 12 steps clockwise (final position: trimaran).\n3. From the trimaran, move 17 steps clockwise (final position: mashed potato).\n4. From the mashed potato, move 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n**Step-by-step for the last part:**\n- Starting point: Mashed potato.\n- Moving 13 steps counter-clockwise means moving through: tile roof, proboscis monkey, trimaran, balloon, cowboy boot, cougar, throne, paper knife, harvester, half-track, drilling rig, Australian Kelpie.\n- Final position: Australian Kelpie.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Australian Kelpie."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
