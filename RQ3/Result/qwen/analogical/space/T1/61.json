The Gordon Setter is the 4th element in the clockwise sequence starting from the Drum.\n2. Moving 10 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 0 steps clockwise because the circular path has 10 elements, making the movement effectively a full circle plus zero additional steps.\n3. Thus, you end up at the same position you started from, which is the Gordon Setter.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Gordon Setter"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
