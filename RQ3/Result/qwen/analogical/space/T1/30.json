Each problem will involve movement around the circular path, but with different starting points or movements.\n\n### Problem 1:\n**Description:** You start at the common gallinule and move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** \n  - Starting at the common gallinule (top dot), moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means moving to the bolete, then to the police van, and finally to the bee eater. Therefore, the item found is the bee eater.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description:** You start at the bolete and move 2 steps clockwise.\n- **Solution:** \n  - Starting at the bolete, moving 2 steps clockwise means moving to the police van, then to the bee eater. Therefore, the item found is the bee eater.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description:** You start at the police van and move 4 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Solution:** \n  - Starting at the police van, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise means moving to the bee eater, then back to the police van, then to the bolete, and finally to the common gallinule.
