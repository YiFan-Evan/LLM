Pencil case\n2. Reflex camera\n3. Broccoli\n4. Waffle iron (3 steps back from the pencil case)\n\nSo, you would find a **waffle iron**.\n\n### Problem 2\n**Description:** \nStarting from the pencil case, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** \nThe sequence of dots starting from the pencil case and moving 10 steps clockwise is:\n1. Pencil case\n2. Reflex camera\n3. Broccoli\n4. Waffle iron\n5. Washing machine\n6. Warthog\n7. Thimble\n8. Ruffed grouse\n9. Mountain bike\n10. Pencil case (back to the starting point)\n\nSince the circular path has 10 dots, moving 10 steps from any point will bring you back to the same point. So, you would find a **pencil case**.\n\n### Problem 3\n**Description:** \nStarting from the pencil case, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- **Solution:** \nFirst, move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the pencil case:\n1. Pencil case\n2. Reflex camera\n3. Broccoli\n4. Waffle iron\n\nYou are now at the waffle iron. Next, move 10 steps clockwise from the waffle iron:\n1. Waffle iron\n2. Washing machine\n3. Warthog\n4.
