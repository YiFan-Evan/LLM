What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The path is circular and consists of 5 dots.\n- Moving counter-clockwise from the Standard Schnauzer, the sequence is: Boston Terrier, Shower Cap, African Wild Dog, Analog Clock.\n- After 3 steps, you end up at the Analog Clock.\n\nSo, the item found is the **Analog Clock**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the Analog Clock, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- The path is circular and consists of 5 dots.\n- Moving counter-clockwise from the Analog Clock, the sequence is: African Wild Dog, Shower Cap, Standard Schnauzer.\n- After 2 steps, you end up at the Shower Cap.\n\nSo, the item found is the **Shower Cap**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the Standard Schnauzer, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then by 2 more steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- First movement (3 steps): From the Standard Schnauzer, moving counter-clockwise, you reach the Analog Clock.\n- Second movement (2 steps): From the Analog Clock, moving counter-clockwise, you reach the Shower Cap.\n\nSo, the item found is the **Shower Cap**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Shower Cap**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
