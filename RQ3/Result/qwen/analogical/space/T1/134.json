Identify the position of the common redshank.\n2. Count 16 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank.\n\nThe sequence starting from the common redshank and moving 16 steps counter-clockwise is:\n1. Acorn squash\n2. Screw\n3. Eel\n4. Car mirror\n5. Trolleybus\n6. Analog clock\n7. Prison\n8. Patas monkey\n9. Lhasa Apso\n10. Crate\n11. Dock\n12. Pillow\n13. Switch\n14. Bath towel\n15. Bookstore\n16. Mud turtle\n\nSo, the item found after moving 16 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank is a **mud turtle**.\n\n### Problem 2:\n- **Starting Position**: Common redshank.\n- **Movements**: Move 20 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Description**: We need to determine the item found after moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Identify the position of the common redshank.\n2. Count 20 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank.\n\nThe sequence starting from the common redshank and moving 20 steps counter-clockwise is:\n1. Acorn squash\n2. Screw\n3. Eel\n4. Car mirror\n5. Trolleybus\n6. Analog clock\n7. Prison\n8. Patas monkey\n9. Lhasa Apso\n10. Crate\n11. Dock\n12. Pillow\n13. Switch\n14. Bath towel\n15. Bookstore\n16. Mud turtle\n17. Chest\n18.

Screw\n\nSo, the item found after moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank is a **screw**.\n\n### Problem 3:\n- **Starting Position**: Common redshank.\n- **Movements**: Move 16 steps counter-clockwise and then 20 steps counter-clockwise.\n- **Description**: We need to determine the item found after moving 16 steps counter-clockwise and then another 20 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Identify the position of the common redshank.\n2. Count 16 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank to reach a mud turtle.\n3. From the mud turtle, count 20 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nFrom the previous solutions, we know:\n- After 16 steps, you land on a mud turtle.\n- From the mud turtle, counting 20 steps counter-clockwise lands you on a **screw**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **screw**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
