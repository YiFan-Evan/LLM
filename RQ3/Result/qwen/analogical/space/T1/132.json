Let's define the circular path with 20 dots and the starting positions for different scenarios.\n\n### Problem 1:\nStarting from the mobile home, you move 12 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at the mobile home.\n2. Move 12 steps clockwise.\n3. The sequence of dots is: mobile home -> Italian Greyhound -> speaker -> confectionery store -> radiator -> scooter -> lab coat -> European garden spider -> bassinet -> plectrum -> Wire Fox Terrier -> pufferfish -> paddle -> marimba -> armadillo -> jellyfish -> Asian elephant -> monitor -> airship -> lorikeet.\n4. After 12 steps, you reach the paddle.\n\n**Answer to Problem 1:** paddle\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the monitor, you move 12 steps clockwise. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at the monitor.\n2. Move 12 steps clockwise.\n3. The sequence of dots is: monitor -> airship -> lorikeet -> mobile home -> Italian Greyhound -> speaker -> confectionery store -> radiator -> scooter -> lab coat -> European garden spider -> bassinet -> plectrum -> Wire Fox Terrier -> pufferfish -> paddle -> marimba -> armadillo -> jellyfish -> Asian elephant.\n4.
