Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise, you will land on the Siberian Husky.\n\n### Problem 2:\n**Description**: From the Siberian Husky, you then move 16 steps clockwise.\n- **Solution**: Starting from the Siberian Husky, moving 16 steps clockwise, you can calculate the position by counting 16 steps around the circle. Since there are 20 dots, moving 16 steps is equivalent to moving 4 steps backwards (since 20 - 16 = 4). Therefore, you will land on the ear.\n\n### Problem 3:\n**Description**: From the ear, you move 7 steps clockwise.\n- **Solution**: Starting from the ear, moving 7 steps clockwise, you can determine the final position by counting 7 steps forward from the ear. This lands you on the guillotine.\n\nNow, combining all the movements:\n- Start at the hartebeest.\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise to the Siberian Husky.\n- Move 16 steps clockwise to the ear.\n- Move 7 steps clockwise to the guillotine.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: guillotine"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
