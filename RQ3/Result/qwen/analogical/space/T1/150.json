You move 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. \n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the lion, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise brings you to the dot containing the analog clock.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou start at the dot where the lion is located. You move 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the lion, moving 10 steps clockwise brings you to the dot containing the thimble.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou start at the dot where the lion is located.
