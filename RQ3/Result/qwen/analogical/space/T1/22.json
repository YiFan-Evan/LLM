Moving one step counter-clockwise means moving to the previous dot.\n   - **Solution**: The element before the overskirt is the llama.\n\n2. **Scenario 2**: From the new position after the counter-clockwise movement, you then move five steps clockwise.\n   - **Description**: After moving one step counter-clockwise from the overskirt, you are now at the llama. Moving five steps clockwise means completing one full circle plus one additional step.\n   - **Solution**: Since moving five steps clockwise from the llama completes one full circle (returning to the llama) and then moves one more step to the next dot, you end up at the macaw.\n\n3. **Scenario 3**: Verifying the final position and identifying the item.\n   - **Description**: We need to confirm the final position after both movements.\n   - **Solution**: As established in Scenario 2, after moving one step counter-clockwise from the overskirt, you are at the llama.
