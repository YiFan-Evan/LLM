You move around the circular path by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the assault rifle, moving 3 steps clockwise lands you on the wool.\n\n**Answer:** wool\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou are positioned on the dot where the analog clock is located. You move around the circular path by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the analog clock, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the assault rifle.\n\n**Answer:** assault rifle\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou are positioned on the dot where the Irish Wolfhound is located. You move around the circular path by 6 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the Irish Wolfhound, moving 6 steps clockwise (which is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise due to the circular nature of the path) lands you on the analog clock.\n\n**Answer:** analog clock\n\n### Original Problem Solution:\nStarting from the ringlet, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction. This brings you to the wool. Then, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Since moving 5 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 0 steps clockwise (because 5 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 5 - 5 = 0 steps clockwise on a circular path of 5 elements), you remain at the wool.\n\n**Answer:** wool\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: wool"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
