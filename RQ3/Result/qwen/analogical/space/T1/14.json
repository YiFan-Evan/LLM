What do you find?\n\n- **Solution**: Since there are only 5 positions and moving 5 steps clockwise brings you back to the starting point, you will find the notebook computer.\n\n### Problem 2:\nStarting from the holster, you move 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n- **Solution**: Moving 3 steps clockwise from the holster, you pass the cricket and the cocktail shaker, landing on the garbage truck.\n\n### Problem 3:\nStarting from the cricket, you move 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n- **Solution**: Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the cricket, you pass the cocktail shaker and the garbage truck, then two steps back to the holster.\n\nNow, let's address the original problem:\n\n### Original Problem:\nStarting from the holster, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.
