The classroom itself isn't a place where one would go to actually purchase supplies. \n\nLet's break down the logic:\n\n1. **Classroom (Option A):** While the classroom is where the student gets the list, it is not where parents would go to buy the supplies.\n2. **Parking Garage (Option B):** This is irrelevant to purchasing school supplies.\n3. **Store (Option C):** This is the most logical place where parents would go to purchase supplies.\n4. **Backpack (Option D):** This is where the student carries the supplies to school, not where parents would buy them.\n5. **Cabinet (Option E):** This is a storage place within the house and not where one would go to buy supplies.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct place for parents to go to buy supplies is the store.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: C.**"}]
