Immortality refers to the quality or state of being immortal, meaning living forever without the possibility of death.\n   - **Solution**: The term that describes someone who can die or will eventually die is \"mortal.\" Mortal means subject to death; not immortal.\n\n2. **Question**: Which word describes the condition of being subject to death rather than the act of dying?\n   - **Description**: This question focuses on distinguishing between terms that describe the state of being able to die and those that describe the process or state of death itself.\n   - **Solution**: The correct term here is also \"mortal.\" While \"death\" and \"dead\" describe the end state or process of dying, \"mortal\" describes the inherent characteristic of being subject to death.\n\n3. **Question**: If a character in a story is described as mortal, what does it imply about their lifespan?\n   - **Description**: This question emphasizes understanding the implications of a character being mortal within a narrative context.\n   - **Solution**: It implies that the character has a limited lifespan and will eventually die.
