However, fridge notes are usually simple and meant to be read quickly.\n   \n2. **Scenario 2:** You come across a note that is hard to read due to its technical nature or complex language.\n   - **Solution:** A note like this might appear in a professional context, such as a medical office where doctors write down patient notes or prescriptions. These notes can be difficult for non-medical personnel to understand.\n   \n3. **Scenario 3:** Imagine a note that is hard to read because it\u2019s written hastily or in a hurry.\n   - **Solution:** Such a note might be found on a desk where someone was working under time pressure and jotted down important information quickly. Desk notes can vary widely in readability depending on the situation.\n\nGiven these scenarios, we're looking for a place where notes are likely to be hard to read due to their inherent nature rather than external factors like lighting or speed of writing.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: E.** \n\nMedical charts often contain complex, technical information written by healthcare professionals who may use abbreviations, shorthand, or terminology that is not immediately clear to others.
