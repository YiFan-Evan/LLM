Therefore, the word that best fits in the blank would be something indicating it is not a negative experience for her. \n   - **Answer:** A. scary\n\n2. **Problem:** He was an avid reader, for him, spending hours in the library was no personal ______.\n   - **Solution:** This implies that he enjoys reading and spending time in the library, so the word should indicate that it\u2019s not a negative experience for him. \n   - **Answer:** C. good feeling (Here, \"good feeling\" is used negatively, meaning he doesn't find it unpleasant.)\n\n3. **Problem:** She was an excellent athlete, for her, rigorous training was no personal ______.\n   - **Solution:** The sentence suggests that rigorous training is not something she finds burdensome or difficult. Instead, she enjoys or handles it well.\n   - **Answer:** D. conflict\n\nNow, returning to the original problem:\n- The context here is about someone who is very outgoing and finds making friends easy. We are looking for a word that indicates this isn't a negative experience or challenge for them.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n- A. scary: This does not fit because making friends is not scary for an outgoing person.\n- B. having friends: This doesn\u2019t make sense grammatically or contextually.\n- C. good feeling: This could work, but it's not quite fitting the structure of the sentence.\n- D. conflict: This makes sense because an outgoing person wouldn't find making friends to be a conflict.\n- E. friendship: This doesn\u2019t fit grammatically or contextually.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: He was very outgoing, for him making friends was no personal what?
