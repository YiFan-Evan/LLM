This directly relates to the fear of illness, as being around sick people increases his risk of getting sick.\n   - **Solution:** He avoids friends who are sick persons.\n\n2. **Scenario 2:** The man had a fear of illness, so he never visited friends who were near a **hospital**.\n   - **Description:** Here, the man avoids visiting friends who live or work near a hospital. Hospitals are places where many sick people are treated, which might increase his anxiety about catching an illness.\n   - **Solution:** He avoids friends who are near hospitals.\n\n3. **Scenario 3:** The man had a fear of illness, so he never visited friends who were **elderly**.\n   - **Description:** In this case, the man avoids visiting elderly friends because they are more likely to be ill. The fear of illness drives him away from those who are at higher risk of health issues.\n   - **Solution:** He avoids friends who are elderly.\n\nGiven these scenarios, the most direct and common reason for someone to avoid visiting friends due to a fear of illness would be that the friends are actually sick.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: A.**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The man had a fear of illness, so he never visited friends who were a what?
