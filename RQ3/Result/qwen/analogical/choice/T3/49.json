Let's break down the options in relation to the context provided:\n\n- **A. small group**: This does not fit well because the question explicitly mentions \"large crowds.\"\n- **B. alone**: This fits well with the idea of feeling isolated despite being in a large crowd, especially given the context of depression.\n- **C. solitary**: While this also conveys a sense of being alone, it doesn't capture the stark contrast with the presence of a large crowd as clearly as \"alone\" does.\n- **D. solitude**: This implies a state of being alone and isolated, which is close to \"alone,\" but it might not convey the same immediacy of feeling isolated in a crowd.\n- **E. panic**: This does not align with the depressive state described; panic implies a sudden onset of fear or anxiety, which does not match the persistent feeling of isolation associated with depression.\n\nConsidering these points, the most appropriate answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. alone"}]
