This can cause significant stress for parents who must constantly attend to the baby's needs.\n   - *Solution:* Parents need to be patient and attentive, establishing a routine that ensures the baby's needs are met consistently.\n\n2. **Problem:** Infants have irregular sleep patterns, often waking frequently during the night, which can disrupt the sleep schedules of both the baby and the parents.\n   - *Solution:* Establishing a bedtime routine and gradually teaching the baby to sleep through longer periods can help improve everyone's sleep quality over time.\n\n3. **Problem:** Babies cannot communicate their needs verbally, leading to frustration and distress when they need something but cannot express it.\n   - *Solution:* Parents learn to interpret the baby\u2019s cries and body language to better understand what the baby needs, and as the baby grows older, they can start to teach simple forms of communication like sign language for babies.\n\nNow, considering the original question about what makes raising a baby difficult, the most fitting answer from the provided options would be related to the inability to communicate effectively. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nB. learn to walk\n\nHowever, this option does not directly address the core challenge of a baby's inability to communicate, which is a significant issue mentioned in the third related problem. The best fit from the given options that reflects the challenge of a baby's inability to communicate would ideally be an option indicating difficulty in verbal communication or expression, but since none directly states that, based on the options provided and the context of the question, the closest related issue is learning to perform tasks independently, such as walking, which is a step towards independence and self-care.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Joan was a baby, so there were many things she couldn't do, which caused problems for her parents.
