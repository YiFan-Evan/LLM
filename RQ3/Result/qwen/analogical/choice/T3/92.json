Let's analyze each option:\n\n**A. Motel:** A motel typically has a reception desk, but it's less common to refer to the reception area specifically as the \"lobby.\" It's more likely part of the building itself.\n\n**B. Hostel:** Similar to motels, hostels have a reception desk, but they do not necessarily have a distinct lobby area.\n\n**C. Building:** This is a broad category that can include various types of structures, including those with reception desks. However, it is not as specific as other options regarding the typical location of a reception desk.\n\n**D. Lobby:** A lobby is the main hall or entrance area of a building, often containing a reception desk. This is the most specific and accurate description for the area where a reception desk is located.\n\n**E. Office Park:** An office park consists of multiple office buildings and may have a reception desk, but it is more of a collection of buildings rather than a single structure with a reception desk.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate answer is the one that refers to the specific area that includes the reception desk at the entrance.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. lobby"}]
