Therefore, it would not be \"full of air.\"\n   \n2. **Problem**: Considering a basketball with a hole in it that retains its general shape, which characteristic would remain unchanged?\n   - **Solution**: Despite having a hole, the ball would still be round or spherical in appearance, so it would still be \"round.\"\n   \n3. **Problem**: How would the condition of a basketball with a hole in it affect its popularity or usage?\n   - **Solution**: The presence of a hole would not necessarily change its popularity in America, where basketball is widely played and enjoyed. Thus, it could still be \"popular in America.\"\n\nGiven these considerations, we can conclude that the basketball with a hole in it but retaining its general shape would not be \"full of air\" since the air would escape through the hole.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What would not be true about a basketball if it had a hole in it but it did not lose its general shape?
