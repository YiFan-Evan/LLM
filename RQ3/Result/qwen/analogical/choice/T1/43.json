The solution would involve using their vision to gather information or relying on tactile senses.\n   - **Solution:** They might read books, use braille, or feel objects to satisfy their curiosity.\n\n2. **Problem:** What would you do if you have curiosity but are paralyzed but have full sensory abilities?\n   - **Description:** This person can see, hear, smell, taste, and touch but cannot move. They need to find ways to explore and learn despite their immobility.\n   - **Solution:** They could listen to audio books, watch videos, or have someone help them experience different things.\n\n3. **Problem:** What would you do if you have curiosity but are blind and have limited mobility but can still move slightly?\n   - **Description:** Here, the person cannot see but can still move a little bit.
