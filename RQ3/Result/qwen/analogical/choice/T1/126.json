What is an appropriate skill to practice that involves basic communication?\n   - **Description**: Kindergarteners are usually between 4-6 years old. They are just starting to learn how to communicate effectively with others.\n   - **Solution**: Asking them to state their names can help in understanding who they are and practicing simple verbal communication. This also helps in creating a friendly and welcoming environment.\n   \n2. **Problem**: During a family gathering, you want to engage a toddler (aged 1-3) in a simple interaction. What could be a suitable activity?\n   - **Description**: Toddlers are still developing their language skills and might not have a full grasp of counting or complex instructions.\n   - **Solution**: Asking the toddler to state their name would be a simple and effective way to engage them without overwhelming them with tasks they may not fully understand or be capable of performing yet.\n   \n3. **Problem**: At a community event aimed at early childhood development, what basic task could be introduced to children aged 2-5 to promote social skills?\n   - **Description**: Introducing a task that encourages basic self-identification and social interaction is key.
