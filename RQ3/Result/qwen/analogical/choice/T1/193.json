However, these facilities are primarily used by students and staff for educational purposes rather than being stores that sell sports equipment.\n   - **Solution:** While schools do have sports equipment, they do not sell it to the public.\n\n2. **Scenario 2:** An office supply store.\n   - **Description:** Office supply stores primarily sell items needed for office work, such as paper, pens, folders, and other stationery supplies. They do not typically stock or sell sports equipment.\n   - **Solution:** Office supply stores focus on office-related items and do not cater to sports equipment needs.\n\n3. **Scenario 3:** A sporting event.\n   - **Description:** Sporting events are venues where sports competitions take place.
