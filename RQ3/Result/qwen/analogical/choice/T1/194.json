Both sports have instances where balls can fly into the stands and hit spectators.\n\n2. **Scenario**: The ball was thrown towards a hoop, and it missed, hitting the backboard instead.\n   - **Description**: This scenario describes a situation typical in basketball, where the ball is thrown at a hoop, and sometimes it misses and hits the backboard.\n   - **Solution**: While this scenario involves a ball, it does not involve the concept of a boundary being crossed and striking an audience member, so it is not relevant to our original question.\n\n3. **Scenario**: People were gathered in a formal setting to discuss societal issues.\n   - **Description**: This scenario describes a meeting or gathering focused on discussing societal matters, which does not involve any type of sport or ball game.\n   - **Solution**: This scenario is not related to sports or games involving balls and boundaries, thus it is irrelevant to the original question.\n\nGiven these considerations, the original question points towards a sport where a ball can go over a boundary and strike an audience member. This clearly describes a game like baseball or cricket.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **A**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The ball was hit over a boundary and struck an audience member.
