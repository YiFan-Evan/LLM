Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer).(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Machines, on the other hand, can be engineered to perform tasks that exceed human capabilities.\n   - *Solution:* Machines can lift extremely heavy loads, move at very high speeds, or work continuously without rest. However, this does not directly align with the options given.\n\n2. **Problem 2:** What can machines do that humans cannot due to environmental hazards?\n   - *Description:* Some environments are too dangerous or inhospitable for humans but can be explored or worked on by machines.\n   - *Solution:* Machines can operate in environments that are too hot, cold, toxic, or radioactive for humans, such as deep-sea exploration or space missions.\n\n3. **Problem 3:** What can machines do that humans cannot due to technological advancements?\n   - *Description:* Technological advancements allow machines to perform tasks that humans cannot, such as processing vast amounts of data quickly or performing repetitive tasks with high precision.\n   - *Solution:* Machines can analyze large datasets faster than humans, perform complex calculations, or execute precise movements repeatedly without error.\n\nAmong the options provided:\n- **A. fail to work**: This describes a potential issue with machines but doesn't highlight a unique capability.\n- **B. perform work**: Both humans and machines can perform work, though machines may do so more efficiently or under harsher conditions.\n- **C. answering questions**: Machines can process and retrieve information faster and handle larger volumes of data than humans.\n- **D. see work**: This is somewhat ambiguous but could refer to visual inspection; however, it does not capture a unique capability.\n- **E. fly**: Machines like airplanes and drones can fly, which is beyond the capability of unassisted humans.\n\nGiven the context and the options, flying is a clear example of a task that machines can do that humans cannot.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: E.**"}]
