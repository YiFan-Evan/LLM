The blank needs to be filled with a word that represents something uncomfortable or challenging for a shy person.\n   - **Solution:** The correct answer would be something that represents discomfort or difficulty, such as \"scary\" or \"challenge.\" Since we have to choose from the given options, \"scary\" makes the most sense in context.\n\n2. **Problem:** He was very introverted, for him being alone was no personal _______.\n   - **Description:** This problem deals with an introverted person who finds comfort in solitude rather than social interactions. The blank should be filled with something that represents a positive aspect of being alone for an introvert.\n   - **Solution:** Given the options, \"good feeling\" might fit best as introverts often feel comfortable and at ease when they are alone.\n\n3. **Problem:** She was very confident, for her standing up to bullies was no personal _______.\n   - **Description:** This problem involves a confident individual who does not find it difficult or problematic to confront bullies.

Instead, it should highlight what is not a concern for an outgoing person.\n- \"Having friends\" and \"friendship\" are too closely related to the act itself and do not represent a personal struggle or issue.\n- \"Good feeling\" could potentially work but is less direct in contrasting the outgoing nature.\n- \"Conflict\" stands out as the best option since making friends is not a source of conflict for an outgoing person.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. conflict"}]
