Among the given options, the most relevant negative effect would be something that directly relates to the physical or mental strain caused by the cold temperature.\n\nGiven the options:\nA. Frostbite - This is a severe condition caused by extreme cold, which is less likely to occur during a chess game.\nB. Tension - This is a plausible outcome since players might tense up from the cold.\nC. Sweat - This is unlikely because it\u2019s cold, not hot.\nD. Perform better - This is positive, not negative.\nE. Enemies - This is unrelated to the cold.\n\nThus, the most fitting negative effect is tension.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. tension"}]
