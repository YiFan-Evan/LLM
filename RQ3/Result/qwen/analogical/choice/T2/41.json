To the child, it looks like a show because they don\u2019t understand the deep beliefs and emotions behind these actions.\n   - **Solution:** The child needs to understand that religion involves sincere beliefs and experiences for those who practice it.\n\n2. **Scenario:** A child listens to people laughing.\n   - **Description:** The child sees people laughing but doesn't grasp the significance or the reasons behind it. For the child, it might seem like just a sound without meaning.\n   - **Solution:** The child needs to understand that laughter often expresses joy, amusement, or relief and is a genuine human reaction.\n\n3. **Scenario:** A child encounters transcendentalism.\n   - **Description:** The child hears about transcendentalism, a philosophical movement that emphasizes individual intuition as a primary source of knowledge. To the child, it may appear abstract and disconnected from everyday life.\n   - **Solution:** The child needs to understand that transcendentalism is a philosophy that values personal experience and intuition, which can be quite profound and meaningful to those who study it.\n\nConsidering these scenarios, the core issue here is the child's inability to comprehend the sincerity or the genuine nature of certain phenomena or beliefs that others take seriously.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: E. people believe.** This indicates that the child cannot understand the genuine beliefs and convictions that others hold."}]
