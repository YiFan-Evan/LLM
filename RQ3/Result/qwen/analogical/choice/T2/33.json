The blank needs to be filled with something that contrasts with her enjoyment.\n   - **Solution:** The word \"scary\" fits here because singing on stage can be scary for many people, but it isn't scary for her due to her love for singing.\n   - **Answer:** A\n\n2. **Problem:** He was a great listener, for him, hearing about other people's problems was no personal ______.\n   - **Description:** This problem involves someone who finds comfort in listening to others, even when those others are discussing difficult topics. The blank needs to be filled with something that contrasts with his comfort.\n   - **Solution:** The word \"having friends\" doesn\u2019t fit well here because the context is about listening to problems, not making friends.

The blank needs to be filled with something that contrasts with her comfort in social settings.\n   - **Solution:** The word \"good feeling\" doesn\u2019t fit well because it does not contrast with the idea of enjoying parties. \"Scary\" or \"stressful\" would make more sense.\n   - **Solution:** The word \"scary\" fits well because going to parties can be scary for some people, but not for her.\n   - **Answer:** A\n\nConsidering the original problem:\n- \"He was very outgoing, for him making friends was no personal ______.\"\n- **Description:** This problem involves someone who is very outgoing and finds making friends easy.
