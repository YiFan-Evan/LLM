Start at the node `23`.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Move on to explore the neighbors of those neighbors, keeping track of the path taken.\n4. Stop when we reach the destination node `22`.\n\nWe'll trace the BFS step-by-step:\n\n- Starting at `23`, it has one neighbor: `20`.\n- From `20`, its neighbors are `14` and `15`. Neither of these leads directly to `22`.\n- Moving on from `14`, its neighbors are `20` and `24`. Again, neither leads to `22`.\n- From `15`, its neighbors are `12` and `20`.
