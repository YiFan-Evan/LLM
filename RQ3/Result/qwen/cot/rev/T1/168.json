Let's go back and check for any missed paths:\n\n- **Revisit Previous Nodes**:\n  - From node 21, no direct connection to 6.\n  - Check other paths:\n    - Node 18: No direct connection to 6.\n    - Node 15: Neighbors are 14, 22, 23. None connects directly to 6.\n    - Node 14: Neighbors are 10, 15. None connects directly to 6.\n    - Node 10: Neighbors are 20, 14. None connects directly to 6.\n    - Node 20: Neighbors are 7. None connects directly to 6.\n\nFinally, let's check the connections of node 6:\n- Neighbors of 6: [11, 16, 19].\n\nSince none of these neighbors have been previously checked, we backtrack and find that node 19 has connections to other nodes.
