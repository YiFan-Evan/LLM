However, the direct connection from node 2 to node 4 is the closest neighbor. Therefore, let's trace back possible paths:\n\n- From node 2 to node 4, and then checking other neighbors of node 4, but none directly lead to 3.\n- Re-checking the neighbors of node 3 directly:\n  - Node 3 connects to 5, 6, and 7, none of which are directly reachable from 2.\n\nGiven the connections, the shortest path must be via node 4, then checking other paths:\n\n- From 2 to 4, then checking if there are any paths from 4 to 3 (there are not).\n\nThus, the only feasible path is directly through node 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->4->3"}]
