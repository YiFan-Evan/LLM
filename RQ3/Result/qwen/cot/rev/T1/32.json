Create a queue and add node 3 to it. Also, maintain a dictionary to keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n\n2. **Exploration**:\n   - Dequeue node 3.\n   - Examine its neighbors (nodes directly connected to it). From the given edges, the neighbors of node 3 are nodes 1 and 2.\n   - For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited, record the path taken to reach it, and enqueue it.\n   \n3. **Continue Exploration**:\n   - Next, dequeue node 1 (since it was enqueued first).\n   - Node 1's neighbors are nodes 3, 4, and 5.

Since node 1 has already been visited, we skip it.\n   - Node 0 hasn't been visited yet, so we record the path from node 3 to node 4 to node 0 and stop since we have reached our destination.\n\nBy tracing back the recorded paths, we can determine the shortest path.\n\nLet's summarize the steps taken:\n\n- Start at node 3.\n- Move to node 1 (via node 3).\n- Move to node 4 (via node 1).\n- Finally, move to node 0 (via node 4).\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 0 is: 3->1->4->0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->1->4->0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The end node: 0 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 3 to node 0, we can again use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
