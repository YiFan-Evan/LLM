Since all edges in this graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach a node is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's walk through the BFS step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Start at node 3.\n   - Mark node 3 as visited and add it to the queue.\n   - Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n\n2. **Exploration**:\n   - Dequeue node 3.\n   - Visit its neighbors: 6.\n   - Mark node 6 as visited and add it to the queue with the path so far: 3->6.\n   \n   - Dequeue node 6.\n   - Visit its neighbors: 12, 14.\n   - Mark node 12 as visited and add it to the queue with the path so far: 3->6->12.\n   - Mark node 14 as visited and add it to the queue with the path so far: 3->6->14.\n   \n   - Dequeue node 12.\n   - Visit its neighbors: 7, 9.\n   - Mark node 7 as visited and add it to the queue with the path so far: 3->6->12->7.\n   - Mark node 9 as visited and add it to the queue with the path so far: 3->6->12->9.\n   \n   - Dequeue node 14.\n   - Node 14 has no neighbors that haven't been visited yet, so nothing happens.\n   \n   - Dequeue node 7.\n   - Visit its neighbors: 0, 9, 12.\n   - Node 0 and 12 have already been visited, so we skip them.\n   - Mark node 9 as visited (already visited, so no action needed).\n   \n   - Dequeue node 9.\n   - Visit its neighbors: 1, 2, 7, 8.\n   - Nodes 1, 2, and 8 have already been visited, so we skip them.\n   - Node 7 has already been visited, so no action needed.\n   \n   - Dequeue node 6 (again, but this doesn't change anything since we already explored it).\n   \n   - Dequeue node 12 (again, but this doesn't change anything since we already explored it).\n\n3. **Continue until destination node 13 is found**:\n   - Dequeue node 13.\n   - Node 13 has no neighbors that haven't been visited yet, so we stop.\n\nWe see that the shortest path to node 13 involves reaching node 10 first, then moving to node 13.\n\nThe path to node 13 is via node 10, which was reached from node 6.
