However, for simplicity, given the small size of the graph, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start at node 4. We'll keep track of the visited nodes and their predecessors to reconstruct the path later.\n\n2. **Expand the neighbors**:\n    - From node 4, we can reach nodes 9 and 6.\n    - From node 9, we can reach nodes 11 and 13.\n    - From node 6, we can reach nodes 12 and 14.\n    - From node 12 and 14, there are no direct paths to node 10.\n    - From node 9, we need to explore further to see if we can reach node 10.\n\n3. **Explore node 9**:\n    - Node 9 has neighbors 11 and 13. Neither of these lead directly to node 10.\n    - Since node 9 does not lead to node 10, we need to check other nodes.\n\n4. **Explore node 6**:\n    - Node 6 has neighbors 12 and 14.
