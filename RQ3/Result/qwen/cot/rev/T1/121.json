In this case, since there are no weights specified on the edges, we'll assume they're all equal and use BFS for simplicity.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can proceed:\n\n1. **Initialize BFS**: Start from node 2. Use a queue to manage the nodes to be visited next. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each node, which helps us reconstruct the path later.\n   \n2. **Traverse the Graph**: Process each node by visiting its neighbors. Add unvisited neighbors to the queue and record their parent nodes.\n\n3. **Track the Destination**: Stop the BFS when we reach the destination node (node 4).\n\nLet's implement these steps:\n\n### Step-by-step BFS Implementation\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [2]\n   - Visited: {2}\n   - Parent: {2: None}\n\n2. **First Iteration**:\n   - Dequeue node 2.\n   - Neighbors of 2: [10]\n   - Enqueue 10; mark it as visited; set parent[10] = 2\n\n3. **Second Iteration**:\n   - Dequeue node 10.\n   - Neighbors of 10: [0, 2, 4]\n     - Node 0: Already visited.\n     - Node 2: Already visited.\n     - Node 4: Not visited yet.\n   - Enqueue 4; mark it as visited; set parent[4] = 10\n\n4. **Destination Reached**:\n   - Node 4 is now dequeued.\n\n### Reconstruct the Path\nNow that we have reached node 4, we can trace back through the parent pointers to get the path from node 2 to node 4:\n\n- Node 4 -> Parent(4) = 10\n- Node 10 -> Parent(10) = 2\n\nThus, the path is: 2 -> 10 -> 4\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->10->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 11], [0, 10], [2, 10], [3, 13], [3, 4], [4, 10], [5, 9], [6, 14], [7, 11], [8, 13], [9, 12], [9, 14], [10, 12]]} The end node: 4 The start node: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 2 to node 4 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
