Since the graph does not seem to have weighted edges, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all neighbors at the current level before moving on to the next level.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. Start from the source node (node 3).\n2. Visit all its neighbors.\n3. Then visit all the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, until reaching the destination node (node 9).\n\nLet's perform BFS step-by-step:\n\n1. Start at node 3.\n2. Node 3 has only one neighbor, which is node 2.\n3. From node 2, we can reach nodes 6 and 14. We add these to our queue.\n4. Next, we explore node 6:\n   - Node 6 has neighbors 11, 7, and 4. Add these to the queue.\n5. Explore node 7:\n   - Node 7 has neighbors 6 and 12. We already visited node 6, so we add node 12 to the queue.\n6. Explore node 12:\n   - Node 12 has neighbors 5 and 0. Add these to the queue.\n7. Continue exploring other nodes, but since we haven't found node 9 yet, let's look further:\n8. Explore node 4:\n   - Node 4 has neighbor 10. Add this to the queue.\n9. Explore node 14:\n   - Node 14 does not have any new unvisited neighbors.\n10. Explore node 11:\n    - Node 11 does not have any new unvisited neighbors.\n11. Explore node 10:\n    - Node 10 does not have any new unvisited neighbors.\n12. Explore node 5:\n    - Node 5 does not have any new unvisited neighbors.\n13. Explore node 0:\n    - Node 0 has neighbors 8 and 12. We already visited node 12, so we add node 8 to the queue.\n14. Explore node 8:\n    - Node 8 has neighbor 13. Add this to the queue.\n15. Explore node 13:\n    - Node 13 has neighbors 8 and 9. Add node 9 to the queue.\n\nWe have now reached the destination node 9.
