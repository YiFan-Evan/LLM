Since all the edges have the same weight (implying no cost differences), BFS would be a straightforward choice.\n\nHere's how we can approach it step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the BFS**: Start at node 8.\n2. **Explore neighbors**: For each node, explore its neighbors level by level.\n3. **Track visited nodes**: Ensure not to revisit nodes already explored to avoid cycles.\n4. **Stop when target is reached**: Terminate the search once we reach node 4.\n\nLet's perform the BFS:\n\n- **Start at node 8**:\n  - Neighbors: 13, 9\n- **From node 13**, there are no further connections to explore directly.\n- **From node 9**:\n  - Neighbors: 11, 8 (already visited)\n- **From node 11**:\n  - Neighbors: 5, 7 (already visited)\n- **From node 5**:\n  - Neighbors: 7, 11 (already visited)\n- **From node 7**:\n  - Neighbors: 12, 14 (already visited)\n- **From node 12**, there are no further connections to explore directly.\n- **From node 14**:\n  - Neighbors: 2, 3, 0, 7 (already visited)\n- **From node 2**, there are no further connections to explore directly.\n- **From node 3**:\n  - Neighbors: 0, 14 (already visited)\n- **From node 0**, there are no further connections to explore directly.\n- **From node 14** again (reached via node 7):\n  - Neighbors: 2, 3, 0, 7 (already visited)\n- **From node 4**:\n  - Neighbors: 14\n\nWe finally reach node 4 from node 14. Therefore, the shortest path is through node 14.\n\nNow let's trace back the path:\n- From node 8, we go to node 9.\n- From node 9, we go to node 11.\n- From node 11, we go to node 5.\n- From node 5, we go to node 7.\n- From node 7, we go to node 14.\n- From node 14, we go to node 4.\n\nThus, the shortest path is: 8->9->11->5->7->14->4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->9->11->5->7->14->4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 6], [2, 14], [3, 14], [4, 14], [5, 11], [5, 7], [6, 10], [6, 9], [7, 12], [7, 14], [8, 13], [8, 9], [9, 11]]} The end node: 4 The start node: 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 8 to node 4, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) since all edges have equal weight.\n\nLet's perform BFS step by step:\n\n1. **Start at node 8**.\n2.
