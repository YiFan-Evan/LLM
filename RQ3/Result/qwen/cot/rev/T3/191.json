In this case, BFS is appropriate because it explores all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to neighbors at the next depth level.\n\nLet's trace through the BFS:\n\n1. Start at node 21.\n2. Explore its neighbors: nodes 8 and 5.\n3. From nodes 8 and 5, explore their neighbors:\n   - Node 8: neighbors are 3 and 21 (already visited).\n   - Node 5: neighbors are 6, 9, and 21 (already visited).\n4. Next, explore the neighbors of these newly discovered nodes:\n   - Node 3: neighbors are 20, 8 (already visited), and 12.\n   - Node 6: neighbors are 5 (already visited) and potentially others not relevant here.\n   - Node 9: neighbors are 5 (already visited) and potentially others not relevant here.\n5.
