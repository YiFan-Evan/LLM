For each neighbor of node 6:\n   - If the neighbor is not visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n3. **Repeat until the destination is found**.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start at node 6.\n2. Enqueue node 6. Neighbors of node 6 are nodes 0 and 4.\n3. Dequeue node 6. Visit neighbors:\n   - Node 0: Enqueue node 0.\n   - Node 4: Enqueue node 4.\n4. Dequeue node 0. Since node 0 is our destination, we stop here.\n\nNow let's trace back the path:\n- Node 0 was reached from node 6 directly.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 6 to node 0 is: 6->0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 2], [1, 5], [2, 7], [3, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems like my previous explanation included unnecessary steps and details.
