Start at node 1.\n2. Explore its neighbors and keep track of the distance from the start node.\n3. Move to the nearest neighbor that hasn't been visited yet.\n4. Repeat until reaching node 22.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can trace it step-by-step:\n\n1. Starting at node 1, we see it connects to nodes 14 and 15.\n2. From node 14, it connects to node 4. From node 15, it connects back to node 1.\n3. Let's explore node 14 further. Node 14 connects to node 4.\n4. Now let's look at node 4. It doesn't directly connect to any useful nodes for reaching node 22, so we'll go back to node 1 and explore node 15.\n5. Node 15 connects back to node 1, which isn't helpful. So we need to move on to another path.\n6. Going back to node 1, we see node 14 and 15 again, but we need to explore further.\n7. Let's consider other nodes. Node 2 connects to node 3, but node 3 doesn't seem to lead directly to node 22.\n8. We need to find a more direct path. Let's trace through the connections:\n   - Node 1 connects to node 14.\n   - Node 14 connects to node 4.\n   - Node 4 doesn\u2019t help us much.\n   - Let's try node 15: Node 15 connects back to node 1, which doesn\u2019t help.\n9. We need to check the neighbors of node 1 again carefully.\n10. Node 10 might be useful. Node 10 connects to nodes 6 and 19.\n11. Node 6 connects to nodes 22 and 10. This seems promising.\n12.
