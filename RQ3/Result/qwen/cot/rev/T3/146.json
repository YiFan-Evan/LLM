In this case, since there are no edge weights specified, we'll assume it's an unweighted graph and use BFS.\n\nLet's perform BFS starting from node 4 to find the shortest path to node 10:\n\n1. Start at node 4.\n2. Visit all neighbors of node 4 and mark them as visited.\n   - Neighbors of 4 are [9].\n   - Current path lengths: 4 (distance = 0), 9 (distance = 1).\n3. Move to the next level of nodes (distance = 2) and visit their neighbors:\n   - Node 9 has neighbors [11, 13].\n   - Current path lengths: 4 (distance = 0), 9 (distance = 1), 11 (distance = 2), 13 (distance = 2).\n4. Continue to the next level (distance = 3):\n   - Nodes 11 and 13 have no new unvisited neighbors leading directly to 10.\n5. Now check the neighbors of node 4 again for any other paths:\n   - Node 4 has another neighbor [6] which hasn't been fully explored yet.\n   - From node 6, we can reach node 12 and node 14.\n6. Explore node 12 and node 14:\n   - Node 12 has no path to 10.\n   - Node 14 has no path to 10.\n7.

Check the neighbors of node 9:\n   - Node 9 has a neighbor [10] which is our target.\n   - Path length to 10 through 9: 4->9->10 (distance = 2).\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 4 to node 10 is: 4->9->10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->9->10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 8], [0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 10], [4, 9], [4, 6], [5, 14], [6, 12], [6, 14], [7, 8], [8, 10], [9, 11], [9, 13]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 4 to node 9, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS), as the graph is unweighted.\n\nHere's how BFS would proceed:\n\n1.
