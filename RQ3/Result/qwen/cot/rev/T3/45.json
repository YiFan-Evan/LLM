Here, we'll use BFS for simplicity.\n\nLet's explore the connections step by step:\n\n1. Start at node 5.\n2. From node 5, the only direct connection is to node 6.\n   - Current path: 5->6\n3. From node 6, there is no direct connection to node 4, so we need to go back to node 5 and try another route if possible.\n4.
