For simplicity, let's use BFS as it is straightforward for unweighted graphs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Initialize the Queue and Visited Set**:\n   - Start by adding the initial node (node 0) to the queue.\n   - Initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n\n2. **Perform BFS**:\n   - Dequeue the first node.\n   - Check if it is the target node (node 4). If yes, construct the path.\n   - Otherwise, add its neighbors to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- **Start at Node 0**:\n  - Add node 0 to the queue.\n  \n- **Dequeue Node 0**:\n  - Neighbors of node 0 are {2}.\n  - Add node 2 to the queue.\n  \n- **Dequeue Node 2**:\n  - Neighbors of node 2 are {5, 0}. \n  - Node 0 has already been visited, so skip it.\n  - Add node 5 to the queue.\n\n- **Dequeue Node 5**:\n  - Neighbors of node 5 are {2}.\n  - Node 2 has already been visited, so skip it.\n\n- **Dequeue Node 1**:\n  - Neighbors of node 1 are {2, 6, 7}.\n  - Node 2 has already been visited, so skip it.\n  - Nodes 6 and 7 have not been visited yet, so add them to the queue.\n\n- **Dequeue Node 6**:\n  - Neighbors of node 6 are {1, 4}.\n  - Node 1 has already been visited, so skip it.\n  - Node 4 has not been visited yet, so add it to the queue.\n\n- **Dequeue Node 4**:\n  - Node 4 is our target node.
