Here, I'll use BFS as it is simpler for unweighted graphs.\n\nLet's map out the connections based on the given edges:\n\n- Node 0 is connected to Node 4.\n- Node 1 is connected to Node 11.\n- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 11, 6, and 13.\n- Node 3 is connected to Node 7.\n- Node 4 is connected to Node 8.\n- Node 5 is connected to Nodes 10 and 8.\n- Node 6 is connected to Node 12.\n- Node 7 is connected to Nodes 8 and 14.\n- Node 8 is connected to Nodes 4, 5, and 9.\n- Node 9 has no outgoing connections mentioned.\n- Node 10 is connected to Node 13.\n- Node 11 has no other outgoing connections mentioned.\n- Node 12 has no other outgoing connections mentioned.\n- Node 13 is connected to Nodes 2 and 10.\n- Node 14 has no other outgoing connections mentioned.\n\nStarting at Node 6, we explore its neighbors and continue until we reach Node 10.\n\n1. Start at Node 6.\n2. From Node 6, we can go to Node 12.\n3. Since Node 12 does not lead us closer to Node 10, we backtrack and look at Node 6's other connections which are already explored or irrelevant.\n4. Next, we see if there are any other direct connections from Node 6 that could lead to Node 10. Node 6 connects directly to Node 12, and Node 12 doesn't help, so we look further back into the graph.\n5. Node 6 also connects indirectly via Node 2, but Node 2 leads to Node 11 and Node 13, and Node 13 is the key connection to Node 10.\n\nSo, the shortest path from Node 6 to Node 10 involves going through Node 2 and then Node 13.\n\nThe path is: 6 -> 2 -> 13 -> 10\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->2->13->10"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 11], [2, 11], [2, 6], [2, 13], [3, 7], [4, 8], [5, 10], [5, 8], [6, 12], [7, 8], [7, 14], [8, 9], [10, 13]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 13"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from Node 6 to Node 13, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach because it explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the destination node, it is via the shortest path.\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Process:\n1. **Start at Node 6**.\n2. **Explore its neighbors**: \n   - Node 6 is connected to Node 12.\n   - Node 6 is also connected to Node 2.\n3. **Explore Node 2's neighbors**:\n   - Node 2 is connected to Node 11.\n   - Node 2 is connected to Node 6 (already visited).\n   - Node 2 is connected to Node 13 (our target).\n\nSince we found Node 13 directly from Node 2, we don't need to explore further.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- Starting at Node 6, we move to Node 2.\n- From Node 2, we move directly to Node 13.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from Node 6 to Node 13 is: 6->2->13\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->2->13"}]
