So, we must find the next best path:\n\n- Node 0 connects to node 2.\n- Node 2 connects to node 3 or node 7.\n- Neither of these leads directly to node 1.\n- We need to trace back from node 1 through its neighbors.\n\nSince node 1 connects directly to node 4 and node 5, and neither of these lead back to node 2, we need to trace back to the original node 0:\n\n- Node 0 connects to node 2.\n- Node 2 connects to node 7.\n- Node 7 connects to node 4.\n- Node 4 connects to node 1.\n\nSo, the path is: 0 -> 2 -> 7 -> 4 -> 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->2->7->4->1."}]
