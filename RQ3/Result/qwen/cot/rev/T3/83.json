Node 12 is connected to node 0.\n- From node 0, explore its neighbors. Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 12.\n- From node 8, explore its neighbors. Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 11.\n- From node 11, explore its neighbors. Node 11 is connected to node 7.\n- From node 7, explore its neighbors. Node 7 has no further connections.\n- From node 8, also explore node 3 (since it's connected to node 8).\n- From node 3, explore its neighbors.

Explore its neighbors: Node 1 is connected to node 12.\n3. From node 12, explore its neighbors: Node 12 is connected to nodes 0 and 1.\n4. Since we already visited node 1, explore node 0:\n   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 12.\n   - We have already explored node 12, so we move to node 8.\n   - Node 8 is connected to nodes 0 and 11.\n   - We have already explored node 0, so we move to node 11.\n   - Node 11 is connected to node 7.\n   - Node 7 has no further connections.\n5.

Move back to node 1 and explore any remaining neighbors (only node 12 already explored).\n8. Now, let's explore other paths from the initial neighbors:\n   - Node 1 is connected to node 12.\n   - From node 12, explore node 0.\n   - From node 0, explore node 8.\n   - From node 8, explore node 3.\n   - From node 3, explore its neighbors: Nodes 3 is connected to nodes 8 and 9.\n   - From node 9, explore its neighbors: Node 9 is connected to node 6.\n   - From node 6, explore its neighbors: Node 6 is connected to nodes 4 and 9.\n   - Finally, we reach node 4.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- From node 1 to node 12.\n- From node 12 to node 0.\n- From node 0 to node 8.\n- From node 8 to node 3.\n- From node 3 to node 9.\n- From node 9 to node 6.\n- From node 6 to node 4.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is:\n\n1->12->0->8->3->9->6->4\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->12->0->8->3->9->6->4"}]
