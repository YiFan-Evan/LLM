Start at node 5.\n2. Explore its neighbors: There are no direct neighbors of node 5.\n3. Move to the next level by exploring the neighbors of the nodes at the previous level:\n   - From node 5, there are no direct neighbors, so we look at other nodes in the graph.\n   - Node 5 connects to node 7, but node 7 does not connect directly to node 6.\n4.
