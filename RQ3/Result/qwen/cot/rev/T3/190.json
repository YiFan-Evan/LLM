Given that all edges have equal weight (assuming no weights are specified), BFS is appropriate for finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\n### Step-by-Step Process:\n\n1. **Initialize BFS**:\n   - Start at node 0.\n   - Use a queue to manage the nodes to be visited next.\n   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each node to reconstruct the path.\n\n2. **Queue Initialization**:\n   - Queue: [0]\n   - Visited: {0}\n   - Parent: {0: None}\n\n3. **Process Each Node in the Queue**:\n   - Dequeue node 0.\n   - Check its neighbors: 1 and 5.\n   - Enqueue neighbors if they haven't been visited yet and update their parent.\n\n4. **Next Level**:\n   - Dequeue node 1.\n   - No new unvisited neighbors.\n   \n   - Dequeue node 5.\n   - Check its neighbors: 7 and 17.\n   - Enqueue neighbors if they haven't been visited yet and update their parent.\n\n5. **Continue until Node 2 is Reached**:\n   - Dequeue node 7.\n   - No new unvisited neighbors.\n   \n   - Dequeue node 17.\n   - Check its neighbors: 11 and 24.\n   - Enqueue neighbors if they haven't been visited yet and update their parent.\n\n   -
