Since all the edges are unweighted, BFS is more appropriate here because it explores nodes level by level.\n\nLet's perform BFS to find the shortest path from node 11 to node 13:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (11) to it.\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each node visited during BFS.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - If the dequeued node is the target node (13), reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its neighbors that have not been visited yet.\n\nHere's the step-by-step BFS:\n\n1. Start at node 11.\n2. Enqueue node 11.\n3. Dequeue node 11, and enqueue its neighbors: 0 and 7.\n4. Dequeue node 0, and enqueue its neighbors: 3 and 11 (already visited).\n5. Dequeue node 7, and enqueue its neighbor: 9 (already visited).\n6. Dequeue node 3, and enqueue its neighbors: 10 and 12.\n7. Dequeue node 10, and enqueue its neighbor: 4.\n8.
