Start at node 3.\n2. Explore its neighbors: node 4 and node 6.\n   - From node 3, we can reach node 4 directly.\n   - So, the path from node 3 to node 4 is simply 3->4.\n\nSince we found the direct connection, there is no need to explore further nodes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 2], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [3, 6], [5, 6]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 4.\n\nSince we found the direct connection, there is no need to explore further nodes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous response.

Since node 4 is one of the neighbors, the shortest path from node 3 to node 4 is directly through the edge [3, 4].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->4"}]
