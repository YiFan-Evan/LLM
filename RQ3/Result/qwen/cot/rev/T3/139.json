Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 14), (2, 11), (3, 13), (4, 6), (4, 12), (4, 9), (5, 11), (7, 14), (8, 9), (9, 11), (9, 14)]\n\n2.

leads to no new nodes.\n  - Node 14 leads to node 7 (already visited).\n\n- From node 14, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 14 is connected to nodes 1 and 7.\n  - Node 7 leads to node 14 (already visited).\n\n- From node 7, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 7 is connected to node 14 (already visited).\n\n- From node 14, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 14 is connected to nodes 1 and 7 (already visited).\n\n- From node 1, explore its neighbors again:\n  - Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 14 (already visited).\n\n- From node 10, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 10 leads to no new nodes.\n\n- From node 13, explore its neighbors again:\n  - Node 13 is connected to node 3 (already visited).\n\n- From node 1, explore its neighbors again:\n  - Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 14 (already visited).\n\n- From node 4, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 12.\n  - Node 6 leads to no new nodes.\n  - Node 9 leads to node 11 (new node).\n\n- From node 9, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 14.\n  - Node 11 leads to node 5 (new node).\n\n- From node 11, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 11 is connected to nodes 2, 5, and 9.\n  - Node 2 leads to no new nodes.\n  - Node 5 leads to no new nodes.\n\n- From node 5, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 5 is connected to nodes 11 (already visited).\n\n- From node 9, explore its neighbors again:\n  - Node 9 is connected to nodes 4, 11, and 14 (already visited).\n\n- From node 14, explore its neighbors again:\n  - Node 14 is connected to nodes 1 and 7 (already visited).\n\n- From node 1, explore its neighbors again:\n  - Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 14 (already visited).\n\n- Finally, from node 4, explore its neighbors again:\n  - Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 12.\n  - Node 6 leads to no new nodes.\n  - Node 9 leads to node 11 (already visited).\n  - Node 12 leads to no new nodes.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest path from node 3 to node 0 involves going through nodes 3 -> 13 -> 1 -> 10 -> 4 -> 9 -> 11 -> 5 -> 11 -> 9 -> 4 -> 6 -> 9 -> 11 -> 5 -> 11 -> 9 -> 4 -> 12 -> 9 -> 11 -> 5 -> 11 -> 9 -> 4 -> 12 -> 9 -> 11 -> 5 -> 11

shortest path from node 3 to node 9, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) as it guarantees the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Initialize the Graph**:\n   - Nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}\n   - Edges: [(0, 4), (1, 10), (1, 13), (1, 14), (2, 11), (3, 13), (4, 6), (4, 12), (4, 9), (5, 11), (7, 14), (8, 9), (9, 11), (9, 14)]\n\n2. **Start Node**: 3\n3. **Destination Node**: 9\n\n### BFS Approach:\n- Start at node 3.\n- Explore its neighbors (if any).\n- Continue exploring until we reach the destination node 9.\n\n### Path Exploration:\n- From node 3, we go to node 13 (since 3 is connected to 13).\n\n- From node 13, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 13 is connected to node 1 (we skip this as we already visited 13).\n  - Node 13 is also connected to node 3 (already visited).\n\n- From node 1, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 1 is connected to nodes 10, 13, and 14 (skip as these are already visited).\n\n- From node 13 again, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 13 is connected to node 3 (already visited).\n\n- From node 4, explore its neighbors:\n  - Node 4 is connected to nodes 6, 9, and 12.\n  - Node 6 leads to no new nodes.\n  - Node 9 is our destination node.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest path from node 3 to node 9 is:\n\n3 -> 13 -> 4 -> 9\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->13->4->9"}]
