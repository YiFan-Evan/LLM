However, node 3 is directly connected to node 4. Therefore, the reverse path from node 3 to node 4 is direct. To get from node 4 to node 3, we need to consider if there are any shorter paths through other nodes.\n\nSince there is no shorter path than going through node 4 itself, the shortest path must go through node 4 first and then directly to node 3.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 4 to node 3 is:\n4->3\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->3"}]
