Start at node 2.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. For each neighbor, explore their neighbors, keeping track of the path taken.\n4. Continue until we reach the destination node 6.\n\nLet's trace through the BFS step-by-step:\n\n1. **Start at node 2**:\n   - Neighbors: [5, 6]\n\n2. **Explore neighbors of node 2**:\n   - Node 5: No further exploration needed yet.\n   - Node 6: This is our destination, so we stop here.\n\nFrom the above steps, we see that the shortest path from node 2 to node 6 is directly connected.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 7], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between nodes 6 and 2, we can again use Breadth-First Search (BFS) since the graph is unweighted.
