However, we need to reach node 3. Let's recheck the connections more carefully:\n\n- Node 13 connects to 10.\n- Node 10 connects to 4.\n- Node 4 connects to 0.\n- Node 0 connects to 7.\n- Node 7 connects to 9.\n- Node 9 connects to 1.\n- Node 1 connects to 8.\n- Node 8 connects to 1.\n- Node 2 connects to 9.\n- Node 6 connects to 12.\n- Node 12 connects to 6 and 14.\n- Node 14 connects to 6.\n\nThe correct path is actually:\n13 -> 10 -> 4 -> 0 -> 7 -> 9 -> 3\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 13->10->4->0->7->9->3"}]
