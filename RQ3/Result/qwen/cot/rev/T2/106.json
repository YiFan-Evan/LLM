Given that all the edges have equal weight, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex.\n\nHere are the steps to apply BFS:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node (node 8) to it.\n2. Maintain a visited list to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. Use a dictionary to record the path taken to reach each node from the starting node.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n- Start at node 8.\n- Visit its neighbors: nodes 6 and 12. Add them to the queue.\n- Visit node 6's neighbors: nodes 0 and 12. Node 12 is already visited, so we skip it.\n- Visit node 0's neighbors: nodes 9 and 6. Nodes 9 and 6 are already visited, so we skip them.\n- Visit node 9's neighbors: nodes 1 and 5. Add them to the queue.\n- Visit node 1's neighbors: nodes 7 and 9. Nodes 9 and 1 are already visited, so we skip them.\n- Visit node 7's neighbors: no new nodes.\n- Visit node 5's neighbors: no new nodes.\n- Visit node 12's neighbors: no new nodes.\n- Visit node 4's neighbors: node 11. Add node 11 to the queue.\n- Visit node 11's neighbors: nodes 3 and 4. Node 4 is already visited, so we add node 3 to the queue.\n\nNow we visit node 3, which is our target node. We have found the shortest path.\n\nTo reconstruct the path, we trace back from node 3 using the recorded paths:\n\n- Node 3 -> Node 11 -> Node 4 -> Node 6 -> Node 8\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 8 to node 3 is:\n8 -> 6 -> 12 -> 4 -> 11 -> 3\n\nHowever, since node 12 is not necessary for the shortest path, we simplify the path:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->6->4->11->3"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 6], [1, 7], [1, 9], [2, 4], [3, 10], [3, 11], [3, 8], [4, 11], [5, 9], [6, 8], [6, 12]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path from the start node (node 3) to the destination node (node 8).\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Create a queue and enqueue the start node (node 3).\n   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path later.\n   - Mark the start node as visited.\n\n2. **Process**:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - Check if the dequeued node is the destination node (node 8).\n     - If yes, reconstruct the path.\n     - If not, enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the current node and mark them as visited.\n\n3. **Reconstruct Path**:\n   - Once the destination node is reached, trace back from the destination node to the start node using the parent dictionary.\n\n### Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [3]\n   - Parent dictionary: {3: None}\n   - Visited: {3}\n\n2. **Process**:\n   - Dequeue node 3.\n   - Neighbors of node 3: [10, 11, 8].\n   - Enqueue unvisited neighbors: [10, 11, 8].\n   - Update parent dictionary: {3: None, 10: 3, 11: 3, 8: 3}.\n   - Mark visited: {3, 10, 11, 8}.\n\n3. **Check Destination**:\n   - Node 8 is in the queue, so we dequeue it and stop the search.\n\n4. **Reconstruct Path**:\n   - Start from node 8 and trace back using the parent dictionary:\n     - 8 -> 3\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 8 is:\n3->8\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->8"}]
