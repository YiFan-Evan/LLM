Start at node 6.\n2. From node 6, the neighbors are:\n   - Node 1 (since [1, 6] is an edge).\n3. From node 1, the neighbors are:\n   - Node 5 (not needed)\n   - Node 4 (not needed)\n   - Node 6 (already visited)\n4. From node 4, the neighbors are:\n   - Node 2 (not needed)\n   - Node 1 (already visited)\n5. From node 2, the neighbors are:\n   - Node 4 (already visited)\n   - Node 7 (needed)\n6.
