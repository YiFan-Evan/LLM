Enqueue both and mark them as visited.\n\n3. **Continue Processing:**\n   - Dequeue node 9 and explore its neighbors.\n   - Node 9 has two neighbors: nodes 6 and 11. Enqueue both and mark them as visited.\n   - Dequeue node 13 and since it does not connect to any new unvisited nodes, we do nothing.\n\n4. **Continue Further:**\n   - Dequeue node 6 and explore its neighbors.\n   - Node 6 has two neighbors: nodes 1 and 10.
