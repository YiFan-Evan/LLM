Since all edges have equal weight, BFS is sufficient and simpler for this task.\n\nLet's walk through the BFS algorithm step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize the BFS Queue**: Start with the source node (3) in the queue.\n2. **Mark the Source Node**: Mark the source node as visited and add it to the current path.\n3. **Process Nodes**: Pop a node from the queue, check its neighbors, and if they haven't been visited, add them to the queue and update their paths.\n4. **Check Destination**: If the destination node (9) is reached, stop the search and return the path.\n\n**Step-by-step BFS Execution:**\n\n1.
