Start at node 6.\n2. Check its neighbors: nodes 4 and 12 (since [6, 4] and [6, 12] are not in the list, there are no direct neighbors).\n3. Move to the next level by checking the neighbors of nodes 4 and 12:\n   - Node 4: Neighbors are [4, 6] (already visited), so no new nodes.\n   - Node 12: Neighbors are [5, 12] (already visited) and [9, 12] (already visited), so no new nodes.\n4. Since there are no new nodes to visit directly from 6, let's go back to our original nodes and see if any other paths might lead us closer to 2.\n5. We know that node 2 is connected to node 1 and node 1 is connected to node 6 via node 3 (indirectly). So let's trace back:\n   - Node 2 is connected to node 1.\n   - Node 1 is connected to node 3.\n   - Node 3 is connected to node 8.\n   - Node 8 is connected to node 7.\n   - Node 7 is connected to node 0.\n   - Node 0 is not directly connected to 6 but node 1 is connected to node 6.\n6. From node 1, we can reach node 6.
