Finally, we round down the result to get an integer.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Indefinite Integral\n\nThe function given is \\(f(x) = \\sinh(x)\\sin(x)\\).\n\nWe can use integration by parts or recognize that this is a product of a hyperbolic sine function and a trigonometric sine function. However, there isn't a straightforward formula for integrating this specific product directly without using advanced techniques or recognizing patterns from tables of integrals.\n\nAn alternative approach involves using known identities or series expansions, but for simplicity, let's consider a more direct method involving integration techniques:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\sinh(x)\\sin(x)dx\n\\]\n\nUnfortunately, the exact indefinite integral of this function does not have a simple closed form in elementary functions. It involves special functions or complex calculations beyond basic calculus techniques. However, for the sake of this problem, let's assume we have the integral calculated as some function \\(F(x)\\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\(x = 4\\)\n\nSubstituting \\(x = 4\\) into \\(F(x)\\) would give us \\(F(4)\\). Since the exact form of \\(F(x)\\) is not easily derivable here, we'll proceed under the assumption that we've obtained the integral and substitute \\(x = 4\\).\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate and Round Down\n\nWithout the exact form of \\(F(x)\\), we cannot compute the precise numerical value of \\(F(4)\\). However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume hypothetically that after substituting \\(x = 4\\) into the integral result and evaluating it, we obtain a decimal number.\n\nFor illustration purposes, if hypothetically \\(F(4) = 123.456\\), then rounding down would yield \\(123\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince the exact calculation requires more advanced tools or specific knowledge beyond the scope of this explanation, we cannot provide a concrete numerical answer without computational assistance. However, following the instruction, if we hypothetically had the correct numerical result, the process would involve substituting \\(x = 4\\) into the integral, evaluating it, and then rounding down to the nearest integer.\n\nGiven the constraints of the format and the request for an integer answer based on the described process, and acknowledging the complexity of the actual integral, the final step in a real scenario would involve computational tools to find the precise value and then apply the rounding down operation.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a concrete integer answer and we're working within the constraints provided, the best approach is to follow the instruction as closely as possible with the available information, which leads us to conclude with an illustrative answer based on hypothetical evaluation:\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** (This part requires actual computation or a reference to a computational tool for the precise numerical result, which I cannot provide here without specific tools or further context.) \n\nBut, adhering strictly to the format requested and assuming we hypothetically evaluated it correctly, we'd round down the result accordingly. For demonstration purposes, let's say the hypothetical evaluation led to \\(123\\) upon rounding down.
