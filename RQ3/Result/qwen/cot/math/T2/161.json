Therefore, we will consider the indefinite integral as \\(F(x)\\) without explicitly solving it.\n\nStep 3: Substitute \\(x = 4\\) into \\(F(x)\\).

However, for the sake of providing a concrete answer based on the instructions given, let's consider the symbolic substitution as our final step before rounding down.\n\nSince we can't compute \\(F(4)\\) directly here due to its complexity and the fact that it involves non-elementary functions, we must conclude based on the instruction to provide a rounded-down integer result from a computation that would typically require computational software for an exact value.\n\nIn practice, to obtain the final numerical result, one would input the integral of the function into a symbolic computation tool like Mathematica, MATLAB, or similar software, which could then provide a numerical approximation of \\(F(4)\\) for us to round down.\n\nGiven the constraints and without actual computational tools available in this environment, we acknowledge the theoretical approach but cannot provide a concrete numerical answer without further computational assistance.\n\nHowever, following the format requested and acknowledging the limitation in direct calculation, the task requires a response in the form of a concluded integer result.
