Find the indefinite integral of the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + x\\).\n2. Substitute \\(x = 4\\) into the result of the indefinite integral.\n3. Round down the result to obtain the final integer.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Indefinite Integral\n\nThe indefinite integral of \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + x\\) can be found by integrating each term separately.\n\n- The indefinite integral of \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) is \\(\\ln|x|\\).\n- The indefinite integral of \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{x^2}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the indefinite integral of \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + x\\) is \\(\\ln|x| + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\\), but since we're excluding the constant \\(C\\), we focus on \\(\\ln|x| + \\frac{x^2}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\(x = 4\\)\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 4\\) into \\(\\ln|x| + \\frac{x^2}{2}\\):\n\n- For \\(\\ln|x|\\), substituting \\(x = 4\\) gives \\(\\ln(4)\\).\n- For \\(\\frac{x^2}{2}\\), substituting \\(x = 4\\) gives \\(\\frac{4^2}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8\\).\n\nSo, substituting \\(x = 4\\) yields \\(\\ln(4) + 8\\).\n\n### Step 3: Calculate and Round Down\n\nWe know that \\(\\ln(4)\\) is approximately 1.386. Therefore, \\(\\ln(4) + 8\\) is approximately \\(1.386 + 8 = 9.386\\).\n\nRounding down \\(9.386\\) to the nearest integer gives us 9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9."}]
