Finally, we'll round down the result to the nearest integer.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Indefinite Integral\n\nThe function is \\(f(x) = \\sinh(x) \\cdot \\sin(x) + x\\).\n\nWe can split the integral into two parts:\n\\[ \\int (\\sinh(x) \\cdot \\sin(x) + x) \\, dx = \\int \\sinh(x) \\cdot \\sin(x) \\, dx + \\int x \\, dx \\]\n\n- The integral of \\(x\\) is straightforward: \n\\[ \\int x \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1 \\]\n\n- The integral of \\(\\sinh(x) \\cdot \\sin(x)\\) is more complex and typically requires numerical methods or symbolic computation tools for an exact solution.

Without computational tools, we cannot determine the exact value of \\(G(4)\\). However, we know that \\(G(4)\\) is a real number, and we add 8 to it.\n\nLet\u2019s assume \\(G(4) = A\\) where \\(A\\) is some real number.
