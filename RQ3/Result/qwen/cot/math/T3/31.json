Calculate the indefinite integral of the given function.\n2. Substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral.\n3. Round down the result to get an integer.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Indefinite Integral\n\nThe given function is \\(f(x) = \\cos(x)\\).\n\nThe indefinite integral of \\(\\cos(x)\\) is \\(\\sin(x)\\). This is because the derivative of \\(\\sin(x)\\) is \\(\\cos(x)\\), which means that integrating \\(\\cos(x)\\) gives us \\(\\sin(x) + C\\), where \\(C\\) is the constant of integration. However, since we are instructed to exclude the constant \\(C\\) and focus on the core integral, we will use \\(\\sin(x)\\) as our result.\n\n### Step 2: Substitute x = 4\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 4\\) into \\(\\sin(x)\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin(4)\n\\]\n\nWe need to evaluate this value. Note that the sine function returns values between -1 and 1, and for \\(x = 4\\) radians, \\(\\sin(4)\\) will be some value within this range. To find the exact value, we can use a calculator or refer to trigonometric tables. \n\nUsing a calculator, we find that \\(\\sin(4)\\) is approximately \\(-0.7568\\).\n\n### Step 3: Round Down\n\nSince the question asks for the integer result of the expression by rounding down, we take the value \\(-0.7568\\) and round it down to the nearest integer. Rounding down means moving towards the smallest integer that is less than or equal to the number.\n\nThus, rounding down \\(-0.7568\\) gives us \\(-1\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \\(-1\\)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: cos(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we need to follow the same steps as before but now with the function \\(f(x) = \\cos(x) + x\\).\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Indefinite Integral\n\nFirst, we calculate the indefinite integral of the function \\(\\cos(x) + x\\).\n\n- The indefinite integral of \\(\\cos(x)\\) is \\(\\sin(x)\\).\n- The indefinite integral of \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{2}x^2\\).\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of \\(\\cos(x) + x\\) is \\(\\sin(x) + \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C\\). Excluding the constant \\(C\\), we have \\(\\sin(x) + \\frac{1}{2}x^2\\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute x = 4\n\nNext, we substitute \\(x = 4\\) into the indefinite integral \\(\\sin(x) + \\frac{1}{2}x^2\\):\n\n\\[\n\\sin(4) + \\frac{1}{2}(4)^2\n\\]\n\nWe already know from earlier that \\(\\sin(4)\\) is approximately \\(-0.7568\\).\n\nCalculating \\(\\frac{1}{2}(4)^2\\) gives:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{2} \\times 16 = 8\n\\]\n\nSo, substituting \\(x = 4\\) yields:\n\n\\[\n-0.7568 + 8 = 7.2432\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Round Down\n\nFinally, we round down \\(7.2432\\) to the nearest integer. Rounding down means moving towards the smallest integer that is less than or equal to the number, which gives us \\(7\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \\(7\\)."}]
