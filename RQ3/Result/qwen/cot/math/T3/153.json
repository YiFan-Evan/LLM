Calculate the indefinite integral of the function.\n2. Substitute \\(x = 4\\) into the result of the indefinite integral.\n3. Round down the result to get an integer value.\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function \\(f(x) = \\frac{1}{x} + x\\)\n\nThe indefinite integral of \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) is \\(\\ln|x|\\).\n\nThe indefinite integral of \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{x^2}{2}\\).\n\nThus, the indefinite integral of \\(\\frac{1}{x} + x\\) is \\(\\ln|x| + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\\).
