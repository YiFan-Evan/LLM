Let \\(u = 1 + x\\), so \\(du = dx\\). The integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{u^2} du = \\int u^{-2} du\n\\]\n\nThe antiderivative of \\(u^{-2}\\) is \\(-u^{-1}\\), so we have:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{u} + C = -\\frac{1}{1+x} + C\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\(x = 4\\)\n\nSubstitute \\(x = 4\\) into the antiderivative:\n\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{1+4} = -\\frac{1}{5}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Round Down\n\nSince \\(-\\frac{1}{5}\\) is already less than zero, rounding down means we take the floor of this value, which is \\(-1\\).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \\(-1\\). However, since the instruction asks for the integer result by rounding down and considering that the context might imply looking for a non-negative integer, if we strictly follow the rounding down rule as applied here, the correct response based on the instructions would be \\(-1\\), but typically when asking for an integer result without specifying negative values, we usually consider positive integers or zero. Given the strict interpretation of the question, the integer result after rounding down is \\(-1\\)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1/(1+x))*(1/(1+x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the solution, let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Simplify the Function\n\nThe given function is \\(\\frac{1}{(1+x)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1+x)}\\), which simplifies to \\(\\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}\\).\n\n### Step 2: Find the Indefinite Integral\n\nWe need to find the indefinite integral of \\(\\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}\\).\n\nLet \\(u = 1 + x\\), then \\(du = dx\\).
