Identify the starting point on the circular path. The clothes iron is located at the top of the path.\n2. Understand the movement: Moving 20 steps counter-clockwise means moving 20 positions backwards on the circular path.\n3. Calculate the new position:\n   - Since there are 20 dots in total, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise would bring us back to the same starting position due to the circular nature of the path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: clothes iron"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
