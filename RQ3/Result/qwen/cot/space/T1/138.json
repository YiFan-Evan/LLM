Based on the provided items, the final position is indeed the suspension bridge, but if we strictly follow the instruction to provide the name of an item:\n\nThe final answer is: suspension bridge (interpreted as the item found at this position, which would be none based on the given list). If we assume the closest item, it would still be none as no item is listed at the suspension bridge position.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: None. \n\nBut if we are to stick strictly to the items listed and assume the question is asking for the last item encountered before the end of movements:\n\nThe final answer is: Bloodhound."}]
