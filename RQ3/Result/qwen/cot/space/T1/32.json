Since there are only 5 items, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to making a full circle back to the starting point (little blue heron).\n\nSo, after moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the little blue heron, you end up back at the little blue heron.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: little blue heron"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
