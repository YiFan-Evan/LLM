Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise now means moving \\(3 - 2 = 1\\) step counter-clockwise from the custard apple.\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 6 steps clockwise.\n   - From the position after the second movement, which was 1 step counter-clockwise from the custard apple, moving 6 steps clockwise brings us back 4 steps clockwise from the custard apple (since \\(10 - 1 + 6 = 15 - 10 = 5\\) steps clockwise from the starting point).\n\nSo, we need to count 5 steps clockwise from the custard apple:\n- Custard Apple (start)\n- A Labrador Retriever (1 step)\n- An armadillo (2 steps)\n- A hyena (3 steps)\n- A threshing machine (4 steps)\n- A great grey owl (5 steps)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: great grey owl"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
