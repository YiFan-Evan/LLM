Move 9 steps counter-clockwise: The positions are counted backwards from the starting point (clockwise positions). Since there are 20 dots in total, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise from the snow leopard would put you at the position of the mud turtle because:\n   - Snow leopard is at position 5 (if we count the hornbill as position 1 and proceed clockwise).\n   - Moving 9 steps back from position 5 lands you at position 14 (since 5-9 = -4, and -4 mod 20 = 16; however, since we're counting backwards from the starting point, it's actually 20-4 = 16 which is equivalent to position 14 when considering the list order).\n3. Move 3 steps clockwise: From the mud turtle (position 14), moving 3 steps clockwise brings you to the position of the tractor, as position 14 + 3 = 17.\n4. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise: From the tractor (position 17), moving 7 steps back lands you at position 10 (since 17-7 = 10).\n5. Move 6 steps clockwise: From position 10, moving 6 steps forward brings you to position 16 (since 10+6 = 16).\n\nPosition 16 corresponds to the position of the waste container.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: waste container"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
