Move 5 steps clockwise: From the Angora rabbit (1st dot), moving 5 steps clockwise brings us to the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier (6th dot).\n4. Move 9 steps clockwise: From the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier (6th dot), moving 9 steps clockwise brings us to the Leonberger (15th dot).\n5. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise: From the Leonberger (15th dot), moving 8 steps counter-clockwise brings us to the Shetland Sheepdog (7th dot).\n\nNow, the 7th dot is occupied by a Shetland Sheepdog.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Shetland Sheepdog. \n\n(Note: The question asks for the item found, but since no item is mentioned at the 7th dot, the correct interpretation based on the provided information would be the animal at that position, which is the Shetland Sheepdog.) \n\nHowever, if the task strictly requires reporting an item and not an animal, and considering the context of the items listed, it seems there is a misunderstanding since no specific item is listed at the 7th position. Based on the given list of items, we can only report the animal present at the 7th position due to the absence of another item. If we strictly adhere to the items provided, we must conclude that there isn't a specified item at the final position.
