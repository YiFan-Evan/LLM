Identify the starting point: The European garden spider.\n2. Calculate the new position after moving 11 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Since there are 20 dots, moving counter-clockwise 11 steps is equivalent to moving clockwise \\(20 - 11 = 9\\) steps.\n   - Starting from the European garden spider, moving 9 steps clockwise lands us at the thimble.\n3.
