Move 15 steps clockwise.\n   From Crash Helmet (position 1), moving 15 steps clockwise lands us at position 16 (1 + 15 = 16, considering modulo 20 for circularity).\n   New position: 16 (Leatherback Sea Turtle)\n\n3. Move 12 steps clockwise.\n   From Leatherback Sea Turtle (position 16), moving 12 steps clockwise lands us at position 4 (16 + 12 = 28, which is equivalent to 8 mod 20, but since we already passed the 20th dot, it's 28 - 20 = 8).\n   New position: 8 (Norwich Terrier)\n\n4.
