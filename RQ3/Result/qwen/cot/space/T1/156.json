Move 7 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - This brings us to the stone wall (since moving counter-clockwise, the sequence goes backwards: otter -> parking meter -> skunk -> Leonberger -> running shoe -> tank -> loggerhead sea turtle -> stone wall).\n\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise:\n   - From the stone wall, moving 2 steps clockwise brings us to the loggerhead sea turtle.\n\n3. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - From the loggerhead sea turtle, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise brings us to the tank.\n\n4. Move 15 steps clockwise:\n   - From the tank, moving 15 steps clockwise brings us past several points including the running shoe, skunk, Leonberger, parking meter, otter, and back to the start (drilling rig) and beyond.\n   - Since there are 20 dots in total, moving 15 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 15 mod 20 = 15 steps.
