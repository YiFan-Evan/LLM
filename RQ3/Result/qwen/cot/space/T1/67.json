Identify the starting position: The starting point is the umbrella.\n2. Count the positions clockwise:\n   - From the umbrella, moving one step clockwise lands on a CD player.\n   - Moving another step lands on a red fox.\n   - Another step lands on an airliner.\n   - One more step lands on a brambling.\n   - Continuing this pattern, we count 10 steps total.\n\nSince the map is circular with 10 positions, moving 10 steps from any position will bring us back to the same position due to the map's cyclic nature.\n\n3.
