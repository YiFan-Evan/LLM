Since the path is circular with 20 dots, the 22nd dot corresponds to the 2nd dot in the sequence (22 - 20 = 2).\n- The 2nd dot in the sequence is the acoustic guitar.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: acoustic guitar."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
