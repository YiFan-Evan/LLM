The next dot after the soccer ball is a knee pad.\n3. **Second movement**: 1 step counter-clockwise. Moving back one step from the knee pad brings you to the banjo.\n4. **Third movement**: 6 steps clockwise. Moving 6 steps clockwise from the banjo lands you on the rhinoceros beetle.\n5. **Fourth movement**: 9 steps counter-clockwise. Moving 9 steps counter-clockwise from the rhinoceros beetle is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (since 10 - 9 = 1), landing you on the half-track.\n6. **Fifth movement**: 4 steps clockwise.
