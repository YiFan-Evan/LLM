First move: 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n2. Second move: 16 steps counter-clockwise.\n3. Third move: 1 step counter-clockwise.\n4. Fourth move: 6 steps clockwise.\n\nWe can sum these moves as follows:\n\nTotal movement (counter-clockwise) = -7 -16 -1 +6 = -18 steps (negative indicates counter-clockwise).\n\nSince the path has 20 dots, moving -18 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 20 - 18 = 2 steps clockwise.\n\nNow, we need to find out which element is located 2 steps clockwise from the starting point, the traffic light.\n\nStarting from the traffic light and moving clockwise:\n1. Traffic light -> 1 step clockwise would be the Treeing Walker Coonhound.\n2. Moving another step clockwise from the Treeing Walker Coonhound lands us on the infant bed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: infant bed."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
