Identify the starting point: The starting point is the grey whale.\n2. Calculate the total movement in steps:\n   - First movement: 1 step clockwise.\n   - Second movement: 3 steps clockwise.\n   - Third movement: 8 steps clockwise.\n   - Total movement = 1 + 3 + 8 = 12 steps clockwise.\n\n3. Since the path is circular with 10 dots, moving 12 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 12 mod 10 = 2 steps clockwise (because every 10 steps bring you back to the same spot).\n\n4. Now we need to see where 2 steps clockwise from the grey whale lands us:\n   - The sequence starting from the grey whale is: grey whale -> lens cap -> bikini.\n   - Therefore, moving 2 steps clockwise from the grey whale lands us on the bikini.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: bikini."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
