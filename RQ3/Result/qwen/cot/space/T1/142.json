Start from the trimaran.\n2. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise (left). This brings us to the dot before the trimaran. Since there are 20 dots, moving 8 steps back means we are now 8 steps away from the trimaran in the counter-clockwise direction. The item before the trimaran is a balloon.\n3. Then move 12 steps clockwise (right). From the balloon, moving 12 steps clockwise lands us at the dot 4 steps past the starting point (trimaran) because 20 - 8 + 12 = 24 - 20 = 4. So, we are now at the microwave oven.\n4. Next, move 17 steps clockwise. From the microwave oven, moving 17 steps clockwise means moving 17 steps forward from the microwave oven. Since there are 20 dots, this is equivalent to moving 17 - 20 = -3 steps or 3 steps counter-clockwise. Therefore, we end up 3 dots before the microwave oven, which is the mashed potato.\n5. Finally, move 13 steps counter-clockwise. From the mashed potato, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 7 steps clockwise (since 20 - 13 = 7). So, we move 7 steps forward from the mashed potato. This lands us on the eastern diamondback rattlesnake.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: eastern diamondback rattlesnake"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
