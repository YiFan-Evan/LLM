Calculate the position after the specified movement:\n   - The circular path consists of 5 dots, labeled as follows (starting from the black swan and moving clockwise): Black Swan, Bagel, Football Helmet, Chainsaw, Weimaraner.\n   - Moving 5 steps from the black swan, since there are only 5 dots, moving 5 steps lands us back on the same dot we started from, which is the black swan.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Black Swan"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
