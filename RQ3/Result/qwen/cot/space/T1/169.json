Move 8 steps counter-clockwise (CCW). Since there are 20 dots, moving 8 steps CCW means subtracting 8 from the starting position. To make sure we stay within the range of 0-19, we can use modulo operation if necessary. The maze is the 20th element (or 0th considering a zero-indexed list), so we calculate (0 - 8) % 20 = 12. This puts us at the stone wall.\n3. Move 4 steps CCW from the stone wall. Again, using the same logic, we calculate (12 - 4) % 20 = 8. This places us at the scabbard.\n4. Move 6 steps clockwise (CW) from the scabbard. We add 6 to the current position, giving us (8 + 6) % 20 = 14. This brings us to the lionfish.\n5. Finally, move 10 steps CW from the lionfish. Adding 10 to the current position, we get (14 + 10) % 20 = 4. This places us at the dumbbell.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: dumbbell"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
