To find the new position, subtract 18 from the current position.\n   - Since the path is circular, moving 20 steps would bring you back to the same position. So, we can simplify this movement by calculating 18 mod 20, which is 18.\n   - Moving 18 steps counter-clockwise from the umbrella, you pass through: doormat, megalith, police van, Egyptian Mau, football helmet, toy terrier, Polaroid camera, three-toed sloth, teapot, hermit crab, chainsaw, chain, great white shark, Komodo dragon, sunglass, desk, bow tie, and stop at the tiger beetle.\n   - Therefore, after the first movement, you are at the tiger beetle.\n\n3. **Second Movement - 2 Steps Counter-Clockwise**:\n   - From the tiger beetle, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise means passing through the Carolina anole and stopping at the bow tie.\n   - Therefore, after the second movement, you are at the bow tie.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: bow tie"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
