From the carton, move 1 step clockwise: \n   - The next item is a red fox.\n2. Move 1 step counter-clockwise:\n   - The previous item is a Basset Hound.\n3. Move 10 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Starting from the Basset Hound and moving backwards, we pass through: Basset Hound -> Red fox -> Carton -> Geoffroy's spider monkey -> Cleaver -> Cuirass -> Gondola -> Agama -> Red-breasted merganser -> Badger.\n   - So, after 10 steps, we land on a Badger.\n4. Move 16 steps clockwise:\n   - Starting from the Badger and moving forwards, we pass through: Badger -> Red-breasted merganser -> Agama -> Gondola -> Cuirass -> Cleaver -> Geoffroy's spider monkey -> Carton -> Red fox -> Basset Hound -> Cuirass -> Gondola -> Agama -> Red-breasted merganser -> Badger -> Red fox.\n   - Since there are 20 dots, moving 16 steps is equivalent to moving 16 % 20 = 16 steps forward. Therefore, we land on a Red fox.\n5. Move 11 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Starting from the Red fox and moving backwards, we pass through: Red fox -> Basset Hound -> Badger -> Red-breasted merganser -> Agama -> Gondola -> Cuirass -> Cleaver -> Geoffroy's spider monkey -> Carton -> Red fox.\n   - After 11 steps, we land on a Badger.\n6.
