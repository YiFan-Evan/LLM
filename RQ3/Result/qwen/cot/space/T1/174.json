Moving 16 steps clockwise from the crate lands us at the 15th element (counting starts from the crate as 1). The 15th element is a white stork.\n3. **Second Movement:** 19 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - From the white stork (the 15th element), moving 19 steps counter-clockwise means we move past the starting point and continue counting backwards. Since there are 20 elements in total, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise from the white stork. Therefore, we land on the 16th element, which is a grille.\n4. **Third Movement:** 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - From the grille (the 16th element), moving 13 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 7 steps clockwise (since 20 - 13 = 7). Moving 7 steps clockwise from the grille lands us on the 3rd element, which is a rock crab.\n5. **Fourth Movement:** 5 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - From the rock crab (the 3rd element), moving 5 steps counter-clockwise lands us on the 18th element (since 3 - 5 + 20 = 18).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: rock crab"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
