Fourth movement: 5 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nTotal counter-clockwise movement = 7 + 10 + 18 + 5 = 40 steps.\n\nSince the path consists of 20 dots, moving 40 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to completing two full circles (since 40 mod 20 = 0).

Move 1 step clockwise: The element after the breakwater is a fountain.\n3. Move 1 step counter-clockwise: This brings us back to the breakwater.\n4. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise: The element before the breakwater is a fountain, so moving 7 steps back would take us to the carton.\n5.
