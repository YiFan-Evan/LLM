Fifth movement: 2 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nFirst, let's convert all movements into a net counter-clockwise movement:\n- Moving 1 step clockwise is equivalent to moving 9 steps counter-clockwise (since there are 10 steps in total).\n\nSo the movements become:\n- 9 steps counter-clockwise (from 1 step clockwise),\n- 1 step counter-clockwise,\n- 4 steps counter-clockwise,\n- 3 steps counter-clockwise,\n- 2 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nTotal counter-clockwise steps = 9 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19 steps.\n\nSince the path has 10 dots, every 10 steps bring us back to the starting point. Therefore, we can reduce 19 steps modulo 10:\n19 mod 10 = 9 steps.\n\nStarting position is the Dobermann. Counting 9 steps counter-clockwise:\n\nDobermann -> bittern (1 step)\nBittern -> otter (2 steps)\nOtter -> military aircraft (3 steps)\nMilitary aircraft -> saxophone (4 steps)\nSaxophone -> Asian elephant (5 steps)\nAsian elephant -> television (6 steps)\nTelevision -> packet (7 steps)\nPacket -> shoe store (8 steps)\nShoe store -> Dobermann (9 steps)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Dobermann."}]
