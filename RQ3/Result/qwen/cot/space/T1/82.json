First, move 6 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - The order is: conch, cabbage, odometer, dog sled, worm snake, kit fox.\n   - After moving 6 steps counter-clockwise, you end up at the kit fox.\n\n2. Then, move 1 step clockwise.\n   - From the kit fox, moving 1 step clockwise lands you at the hot pot.\n\n3.
