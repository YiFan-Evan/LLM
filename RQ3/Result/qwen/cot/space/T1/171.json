The initial position from which you start moving is the orangutan.

Move 18 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Since the path is circular, we can calculate this using modulo arithmetic.\n   - \\(18 \\mod 20 = 18\\)\n   - So, you end up back at the orangutan (dot 18).\n\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise:\n   - \\(18 + 2 = 20\\)\n   - So, you end up at the flagpole (dot 20).\n\n3. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - \\(20 - 13 = 7\\)\n   - So, you end up at the minibus (dot 7).\n\n4.
