Since the path has 20 elements, we take the remainder of 25 divided by 20, which is 5.\n   - Therefore, after 15 steps, we land on the tenth element plus 5 more steps, which is the tailed frog (the 4th element).\n\n3. **Second Movement**: 14 steps clockwise.\n   - From the tailed frog (the 4th element), moving 14 steps clockwise lands us at the element 4 + 14 = 18. \n   - Taking the remainder of 18 divided by 20 gives us 18.\n   - Therefore, after 14 steps, we land on the soup bowl (the 17th element).\n\n4. **Third Movement**: 8 steps clockwise.\n   - From the soup bowl (the 17th element), moving 8 steps clockwise lands us at the element 17 + 8 = 25.\n   - Taking the remainder of 25 divided by 20 gives us 5.\n   - Therefore, after 8 steps, we land on the tailed frog (the 4th element).\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - From the tailed frog (the 4th element), moving 3 steps counter-clockwise lands us at the element 4 - 3 = 1.\n   - Therefore, after 3 steps, we land on the green mamba (the 0th element).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: green mamba"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
