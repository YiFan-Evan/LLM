Move 16 steps clockwise:\n   - The sequence is: Prairie Grouse, Common Squirrel Monkey, Ping-Pong Ball, Eraser, Bookstore, Prayer Rug, Necklace, Australian Silky Terrier, Peacock, Wok, Wild Boar, Swimming Cap, Beer Glass, Paper Towel, Wing, Water Jug, Scuba Diver, Artichoke, Mixing Bowl.\n   - Moving 16 steps from Prairie Grouse lands us on Mixing Bowl.\n\n2. Move 17 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Moving counter-clockwise means we subtract steps. Since there are 20 dots, moving 17 steps back is equivalent to moving 3 steps forward (20 - 17 = 3).\n   - Moving 3 steps forward from Mixing Bowl lands us on Artichoke.\n\n3. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 15 steps clockwise (20 - 5 = 15).\n   - Moving 15 steps forward from Artichoke lands us on Water Jug.\n\n4. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 13 steps clockwise (20 - 7 = 13).\n   - Moving 13 steps forward from Water Jug lands us on Wing.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Wing"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Move 32 steps clockwise:\n   - Each full circle is 20 steps, so 32 steps is equivalent to 12 steps clockwise (32 % 20 = 12).\n   - Moving 12 steps forward from Prairie Grouse lands us on an Australian Silky Terrier.\n\n2. Move 34 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - 34 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to 6 steps clockwise (34 % 20 = 14; 20 - 14 = 6).\n   - Moving 6 steps forward from Australian Silky Terrier lands us on a Prayer Rug.\n\n3. Move 10 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - 10 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to 10 steps clockwise (20 - 10 = 10).\n   - Moving 10 steps forward from Prayer Rug lands us on a Bookstore.\n\n4. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - 14 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to 6 steps clockwise (20 - 14 = 6).\n   - Moving 6 steps forward from Bookstore lands us on a Peacock.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Peacock"}]
