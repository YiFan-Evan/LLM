This is because the circular nature means you wrap around after reaching the last element. \n\n3. **Second Movement - 10 Steps Counter-Clockwise**:\n   - From the Lhasa Apso (1st position), moving 10 steps counter-clockwise will bring you back to the starting point. This is because moving 10 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving all the way around the circle once, which brings you back to the same spot.\n\nSo, after both movements, you end up back at the Lhasa Apso.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Lhasa Apso"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.

Since there are 10 positions, moving 18 steps is equivalent to moving \\(18 \\mod 10 = 8\\) steps clockwise.\n   - Moving 8 steps clockwise from the odometer (7th position) lands you on the duck (5th position).\n\n3. **Second Movement - 20 Steps Counter-Clockwise**:\n   - From the duck (5th position), moving 20 steps counter-clockwise means moving through the full circle multiple times.
