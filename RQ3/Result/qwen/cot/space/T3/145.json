Move 16 steps clockwise:\n   - 20 - 16 = 4 (since we need to wrap around the circle, 20 - the number of steps moved)\n   - The new position is the 4th element after goldfish, which is a brain coral.\n3. Move 4 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - 4 - 4 = 0 (if we go back 4 steps, we end up at the starting point of the current segment)\n   - The new position is the 0th element after brain coral, which is still a brain coral.\n4. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Since we are already at brain coral (0), moving counter-clockwise 13 steps means moving 7 steps past the start of the circle (20 - 13 = 7).\n   - The new position is the 7th element before brain coral. Counting backwards from brain coral, we get: brain coral, beer bottle, motorboat, maraca, chimpanzee, ladle, washing machine, infant bed.\n   - The new position is an infant bed.\n5.
