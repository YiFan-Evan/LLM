The Gordon Setter is the 4th element on the circular path.\n2. Moving counter-clockwise by 10 steps means we subtract 10 from the position index. Since the map is circular with 10 elements, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 0 steps (or staying in the same position).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Gordon Setter"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
