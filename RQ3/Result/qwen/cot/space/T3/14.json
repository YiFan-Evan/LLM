Since the path is circular with 5 elements, moving counter-clockwise effectively means moving forward in the sequence (since counter-clockwise is the opposite direction of the sequence we've established):\n\n1. 1 step counter-clockwise from holster = Garbage truck\n2. 2 steps counter-clockwise from holster = Notebook computer\n3. 3 steps counter-clockwise from holster = Holster\n4. 4 steps counter-clockwise from holster = Cricket\n5. 5 steps counter-clockwise from holster = Cocktail shaker\n\nSince we're moving 10 steps counter-clockwise, we complete two full circles (each circle is 5 steps). Therefore, after 10 steps, we end up at the same place as 0 steps, which is the starting point of our counter-clockwise movement from the holster.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Garbage truck"}]
