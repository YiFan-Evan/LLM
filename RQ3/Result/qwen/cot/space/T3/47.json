Starting from the custard apple (position 6), moving 20 steps counter-clockwise means we effectively move 20 % 10 = 0 steps because 20 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to completing exactly 2 full circles and ending up at the same position.\n\nThus, starting from the custard apple and moving 20 steps counter-clockwise lands us back at the custard apple.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: custard apple"}]
