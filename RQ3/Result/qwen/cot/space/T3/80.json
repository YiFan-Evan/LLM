To find the final position, we can consider the total number of positions (10) and use modulo arithmetic for simplification.\n   - 18 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to \\(18 \\mod 10 = 8\\) steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Starting from the packet, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise involves counting backwards through the elements:\n     - Packet -> Grocery store (1 step back)\n     - Grocery store -> Palace (2 steps back)\n     - Palace -> Weimaraner (3 steps back)\n     - Weimaraner -> Salt shaker (4 steps back)\n     - Salt shaker -> Oxygen mask (5 steps back)\n     - Oxygen mask -> European polecat (6 steps back)\n     - European polecat -> Black and Tan Coonhound (7 steps back)\n     - Black and Tan Coonhound -> Paper knife (8 steps back)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: paper knife"}]
