Every 10 steps bring you back to the starting point.\n   - So, 20 steps is equivalent to 20 % 10 = 0 steps, meaning you end up at the same spot you were after the first movement.\n   - Therefore, moving 20 steps clockwise from the reflex camera lands you back on the reflex camera.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: reflex camera"}]
