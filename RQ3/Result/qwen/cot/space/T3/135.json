Start at the Asian elephant.\n2.

Move 19 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise because 20 - 19 = 1.\n   - Starting from the Gordon Setter, moving 1 step clockwise lands us on the Scottish Terrier.\n\n4. Move 7 steps clockwise:\n   - Starting from the Scottish Terrier, moving 7 steps clockwise lands us on the poke bonnet.\n\n5.

Start at the Asian elephant.\n2.

Move 38 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Moving 38 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 18 steps clockwise because 38 mod 20 = 18 and 20 - 18 = 2, but since it's counter-clockwise, we subtract this from our current position.\n   - Starting from the goldfinch, moving 18 steps clockwise lands us on a Dobermann.\n\n4.
