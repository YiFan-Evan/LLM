Moving 12 steps clockwise from the monitor means moving past 12 dots. To find the exact dot, we calculate the position modulo 20:\n   - Moving 12 steps from the monitor lands us on the jellyfish (since the sequence goes: monitor -> airship -> lorikeet -> ... -> jellyfish).\n3. **Move 12 Steps Counter-Clockwise**: Now, we need to move 12 steps counter-clockwise from the jellyfish. Since moving 12 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 8 steps clockwise (because 20 - 12 = 8), we need to find the dot 8 steps clockwise from the jellyfish.\n   - Jellyfish -> Asian elephant -> monitor -> airship -> lorikeet -> ... -> armadillo -> jellyfish -> marimba -> paddle -> pufferfish -> Wire Fox Terrier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: pufferfish."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
