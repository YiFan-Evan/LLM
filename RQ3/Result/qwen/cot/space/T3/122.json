Starting from the Revolver and moving 10 steps counter-clockwise:\n\nThe sequence going counter-clockwise from Revolver:\n- Revolver\n- Bathtub\n- Loggerhead Sea Turtle\n- Confectionery Store\n- Spotlight\n- Magnetic Compass\n- Space Bar\n- Pajamas\n- Lorikeet\n- Ski Mask\n- King Charles Spaniel\n\nSo, 10 steps counter-clockwise from Revolver lands us back at the King Charles Spaniel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: King Charles Spaniel"}]
