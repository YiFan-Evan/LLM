Move 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n3. Move 16 steps clockwise.\n4. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n5. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Counter-clockwise movements: 8 + 7 + 13 = 28 steps.\n- Clockwise movements: 16 steps.\n\nSince the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise or clockwise would bring us back to the same position. Therefore, we reduce the net counter-clockwise movement modulo 20:\n\\[ 28 \\mod 20 = 8 \\text{ steps counter-clockwise} \\]\n\nSo, we effectively need to move 8 steps counter-clockwise from the breakwater.\n\nNow, let's trace the positions step-by-step starting from the breakwater:\n- Breakwater -> Cannon (since moving 1 step counter-clockwise from breakwater lands on cannon).\n\nContinuing this pattern:\n- Cannon -> Sea Slug (since moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from breakwater lands on sea slug).\n\nSo, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the breakwater lands us on the sea slug.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: sea slug."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
