Therefore, you end up at the same position as if you moved 2 steps clockwise from the sunscreen. The sequence clockwise from sunscreen is: Bluetick Coonhound, Sea Cucumber, Brittany, Japanese Chin, Gordon Setter, Milk Can, Weasel, Cradle, Flamingo, Toilet Seat, Forklift, Dowitcher, Butternut Squash, Pencil Case, Billiard Table, and then back to the start at the Radiator. So, moving 2 steps clockwise from sunscreen lands you at the Bluetick Coonhound.\n3. **Second Movement:** Move 9 steps clockwise.\n   - From the Bluetick Coonhound, moving 9 steps clockwise lands you 1 step before completing a full circle. Counting 9 steps from the Bluetick Coonhound, you pass through Sea Cucumber, Brittany, Japanese Chin, Gordon Setter, Milk Can, Weasel, Cradle, and Flamingo, landing on the Toilet Seat.\n4. **Third Movement:** Move 14 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 6 steps clockwise (since 20 - 14 = 6). From the Toilet Seat, moving 6 steps clockwise lands you on the Forklift.\n5. **Fourth Movement:** Move 13 steps clockwise.\n   - From the Forklift, moving 13 steps clockwise lands you 7 steps short of completing a full circle. Counting 13 steps from the Forklift, you pass through Dowitcher, Butternut Squash, Pencil Case, Billiard Table, Radiator, and end up at the Gordon Setter.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Gordon Setter."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
