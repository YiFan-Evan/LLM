Identify the initial position: You start at the Saluki.\n2. Determine the number of steps and the circular nature of the path: Since the path is circular and consists of 5 dots, every 5 steps will bring you back to the starting point.\n\nMoving 10 steps is equivalent to moving 2 full loops around the circle because \\(10 \\div 5 = 2\\).\n\nSince moving 10 steps is the same as moving 0 steps in terms of reaching a new position on the circle (because it completes exactly 2 full loops), you end up at the same position where you started, which is the Saluki.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Saluki"}]
