Again, converting this to a positive position within the range of 0 to 19:\n     \\[\n     -8 \\equiv 12 \\pmod{20}\n     \\]\n   - So, after the second movement, the position remains at the dust jacket (position 12).\n\n4. **Third Movement:** Move 36 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Position after third movement: \\(12 - 36 = -24\\). Converting this to a positive position within the range of 0 to 19:\n     \\[\n     -24 \\equiv 16 \\pmod{20}\n     \\]\n   - So, after the third movement, the position is at the lampshade (position 16).\n\n5. **Fourth Movement:** Move 10 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Position after fourth movement: \\(16 - 10 = 6\\).\n   - So, after the fourth movement, the position is back at the breakwater (position 6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: breakwater"}]
