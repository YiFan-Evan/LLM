Starting from the ski mask, moving 26 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 6 steps clockwise because \\(26 \\mod 20 = 6\\). So, you end up at the bolete.\n2. From the bolete, moving 20 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 0 steps clockwise because \\(20 \\mod 20 = 0\\). This means you stay at the bolete.\n3.
