Since the path is circular with 10 items, moving 20 steps is equivalent to moving \\(20 \\mod 10 = 0\\) steps. This means moving 20 steps is the same as not moving at all, or moving 10 steps which would bring you back to the starting point.\n\nSo, after moving 20 steps (which is effectively 0 steps due to the circular nature), you remain at the pajamas.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: pajamas"}]
