Converting this to a positive index within the range 0 to 19: \\(-2 + 20 = 18\\). Therefore, we land on the thimble.\n\n3. **Second Movement:** Move 16 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Moving 16 steps counter-clockwise from the thimble (position 18) lands us at position \\(18 - 16 = 2\\). Therefore, we land on the gyromitra.\n\n4. **Third Movement:** Move 16 steps clockwise.\n   - Moving 16 steps clockwise from the gyromitra (position 2) lands us at position \\(2 + 16 = 18\\).
