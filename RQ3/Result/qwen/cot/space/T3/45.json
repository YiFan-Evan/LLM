First movement: 4 steps counter-clockwise from the Dobermann.\n   - The sequence starting from the Dobermann (clockwise) would be: Komondor, bittern, otter, military aircraft.\n   - Moving counter-clockwise from Dobermann: Dobermann -> Asian elephant -> television -> saxophone -> military aircraft.\n   - So after moving 4 steps counter-clockwise, you land on the military aircraft.\n\n2. Second movement: 3 steps counter-clockwise from the military aircraft.\n   - Moving counter-clockwise from the military aircraft: Military aircraft -> saxophone -> Asian elephant -> television.\n   - After moving 3 steps counter-clockwise, you land on the television.\n\n3. Third movement: 2 steps counter-clockwise from the television.\n   - Moving counter-clockwise from the television: Television -> Asian elephant -> saxophone -> military aircraft.\n   - After moving 2 steps counter-clockwise, you land on the saxophone.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: saxophone."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
