Move 8 steps counter-clockwise: Since the path is circular, moving counter-clockwise can be represented as subtracting from the current position. Thus, moving 8 steps back from the trimaran is equivalent to adding \\(20 - 8 = 12\\) steps clockwise (because \\(20 - 8 \\mod 20 = 12\\)).\n3. Add 12 more steps clockwise: \\(12 + 12 = 24\\) steps clockwise total.\n4. Add 17 more steps clockwise: \\(24 + 17 = 41\\) steps clockwise total.\n5.
