Paintbrush\n2. Jaguar\n3. Swimsuit\n4. English Setter\n5. Wire Fox Terrier\n\nGiven that the path consists of 5 connected dots, every 5 steps will bring you back to the starting point. Therefore, moving 10 steps is equivalent to moving 2 full cycles around the circle (since 10 divided by 5 equals 2).\n\nMoving 10 steps from the paintbrush is the same as moving 0 steps because you complete two full cycles and return to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: paintbrush"}]
