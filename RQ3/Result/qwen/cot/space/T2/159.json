Since the map is circular with 20 positions, we take the remainder when divided by 20: \\(24 \\mod 20 = 4\\).\n- Moving 11 steps clockwise from position 4 brings us to position \\(4 + 11 = 15\\).\n\nSo, after both movements, you end up at the same position as the European garden spider.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: European garden spider."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
