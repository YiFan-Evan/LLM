Move 16 steps clockwise:\n   - Starting from the crate, moving 16 steps clockwise lands you on the white stork (since 1 crate + 16 steps = 17th dot, which is the white stork).\n\n2. Move 19 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - From the white stork, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise: Since the map has 20 dots, moving 19 steps back is equivalent to moving 1 step forward (20 - 19 = 1), landing you on the grille (the 18th dot).\n\n3. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - From the grille, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise: Moving 13 steps back is equivalent to moving 7 steps forward (20 - 13 = 7), landing you on the Alpine ibex (the 11th dot).\n\n4. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - From the Alpine ibex, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise: Moving 5 steps back is equivalent to moving 15 steps forward (20 - 5 = 15), landing you on the indigo bunting (the 6th dot).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: indigo bunting."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
