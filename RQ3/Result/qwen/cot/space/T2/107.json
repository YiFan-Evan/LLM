Thus, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the Pencil Case.\n\nSecond movement: Move 10 steps clockwise.\n- Since there are only 10 elements on the path, moving 10 steps clockwise will bring you back to the starting position.\n\nSince the second movement brings you back to the starting position, the final position is the Pencil Case.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Pencil Case"}]
