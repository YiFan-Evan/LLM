Move 7 steps counter-clockwise (CCW).\n3. Move 16 steps CCW.\n4. Move 1 step CCW.\n5. Move 6 steps clockwise (CW).\n\nWe can calculate the net movement by converting all movements into a single direction (either CW or CCW). For simplicity, let's use CCW as positive and CW as negative.\n\nThe total net movement in CCW direction:\n- Initial position: Traffic light\n- Movement 1: -7 (7 steps CCW)\n- Movement 2: -16 (16 steps CCW)\n- Movement 3: -1 (1 step CCW)\n- Movement 4: +6 (6 steps CW, which is -6 CCW)\n\nSumming these up:\n-7 - 16 - 1 - 6 = -30\n\nSince the map is circular with 20 dots, moving -30 steps is equivalent to moving -30 mod 20 steps. This simplifies to:\n-30 mod 20 = -10 (since -30 is 10 steps away from the starting point in the CCW direction)\n\nStarting from the traffic light (last element), moving 10 steps CCW would mean moving back 10 positions in the list.\n\nLet's count backwards from the traffic light:\n- Traffic light\n- Treeing Walker Coonhound\n- Infant bed\n- Ping-pong ball\n- Quilt\n- Bloodhound\n- Black-and-white colobus\n- Stupa\n- Dog sled\n- Bookcase\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: bookcase"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
