Move 7 steps counter-clockwise:\n   The sequence is: drilling rig -> plate -> prayer rug -> Keeshond -> vending machine -> crane -> moped -> [Keeshond]\n   Since we move 7 steps counter-clockwise from the drilling rig, we end up at the prayer rug.\n\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise:\n   From the prayer rug, moving 2 steps clockwise brings us to the Keeshond.\n\n3. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise:\n   From the Keeshond, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise brings us to the vending machine.\n\n4. Move 15 steps clockwise:\n   From the vending machine, moving 15 steps clockwise, considering the circular nature of the map:\n   - The full circle has 20 steps, so moving 15 steps is equivalent to moving 15 steps forward.\n   - The sequence from the vending machine moving clockwise is: vending machine -> crane -> moped -> pajamas -> coho salmon -> ring-necked snake -> centipede -> great egret -> stone wall -> loggerhead sea turtle -> tank -> running shoe -> skunk -> Leonberger -> parking meter -> [otter] -> [plate] -> [prayer rug] -> [Keeshond] -> [vending machine].\n   - Therefore, moving 15 steps clockwise from the vending machine lands us on the parking meter.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: parking meter"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
