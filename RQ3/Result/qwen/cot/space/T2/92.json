Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards through the list:\n   - Paper towel -> Horse chestnut seed -> Harvester -> Bighorn sheep -> Boathouse -> Ox.\n3. Then, we move 10 steps clockwise. Since there are 10 positions in total, moving 10 steps clockwise brings us back to the starting point (the paper towel). \n\nLet's break it down step-by-step:\n\n- Counter-clockwise movement from paper towel: \n  - 1st step: Ox\n  - 2nd step: Bighorn sheep\n  - 3rd step: Harvester\n  - 4th step: Horse chestnut seed\n  - 5th step: Paper towel (back to the starting point).\n\n- Now, we move 10 steps clockwise from the paper towel.
