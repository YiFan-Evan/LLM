Then moving 12 steps counter-clockwise from the \"earth star\" puts us at the \"accordion\".\n4. Moving 15 steps clockwise from the \"accordion\" means we need to count 15 steps forward.

From the spider web, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise, you effectively move \\(20 - 15 = 5\\) steps clockwise (since it's a circular path), landing you at the hoop skirt.\n4.
