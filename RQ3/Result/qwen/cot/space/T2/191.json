Move 18 steps clockwise: \n   - The circular path has 20 dots, so moving 18 steps clockwise from the sunscreen lands us on the Italian Greyhound (since 18 steps forward from the sunscreen would skip over all other items and land on the Italian Greyhound directly).\n\n3. Then move 9 steps clockwise:\n   - From the Italian Greyhound, moving 9 steps clockwise lands us on the toilet seat.\n\n4. Then move 14 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 6 steps clockwise (since 14 steps back on a 20-dot circle is the same as moving 20 - 14 = 6 steps forward).\n   - So from the toilet seat, moving 6 steps clockwise lands us on the dowitcher.\n\n5.
