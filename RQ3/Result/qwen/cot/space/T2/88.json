Identify the starting point after the first movement:\n   - Starting from the pill bottle (position 1), moving 2 steps clockwise lands you on the dining table (position 4).\n\n2. Identify the new position after the second movement:\n   - From the dining table (position 4), moving another 2 steps clockwise lands you on the Clumber Spaniel (position 6).\n\n3. Identify the final position after the third movement:\n   - From the Clumber Spaniel (position 6), moving 5 steps clockwise lands you on the Miniature Schnauzer (position 11, which wraps around to position 1 because there are only 10 positions).\n\nSince the path has only 10 positions, position 11 is equivalent to position 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Miniature Schnauzer"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
