Move 2 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - The sequence is: grasshopper -> ice cream.\n   - After 2 more steps, you are on the ice cream.\n4. Move 5 steps clockwise:\n   - The sequence is: ice cream -> honeycomb -> weasel -> hot pot -> ruffed grouse.\n   - After 5 steps, you are on the ruffed grouse.\n5. Move 16 steps clockwise:\n   - The sequence is: ruffed grouse -> centipede -> earth star -> necklace -> barrette -> sleeping bag -> barrette -> earth star -> centipede -> ruffed grouse -> hot pot -> weasel -> honeycomb -> sock -> grasshopper -> ice cream.\n   - Since there are 20 dots, moving 16 steps is equivalent to moving 16 % 20 = 16 steps.\n   - After 16 steps, you are on the ice cream.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ice cream. \n\n(Note: Upon re-evaluating the detailed steps, it becomes clear that the last movement actually brings you back to the ice cream.
