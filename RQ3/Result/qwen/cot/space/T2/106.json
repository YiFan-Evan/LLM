Starting at the chambered nautilus, moving 1 step counter-clockwise lands you at the Basenji.\n2. From the Basenji, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise involves passing through all the previous positions (half-track, turnstile, wine bottle, hot pot, trilobite, acorn, Weimaraner) and ends up back at the chambered nautilus.\n3.
