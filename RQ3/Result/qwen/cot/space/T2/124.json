Since we are already at a coral reef, we count 18 steps from there.\n   - Counting 18 steps clockwise from a coral reef lands us back at the European polecat (since 18 steps clockwise is just 2 steps short of a full circle, which brings us back to the European polecat).\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 18 steps clockwise again from the European polecat.\n   - As established, moving 18 steps from the European polecat lands us back at the European polecat.\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Move 5 steps clockwise from the European polecat.\n   - As previously calculated, moving 5 steps from the European polecat lands us on a coral reef.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: coral reef"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
