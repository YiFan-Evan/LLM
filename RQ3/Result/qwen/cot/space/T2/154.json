The starting point is the ptarmigan.\n2. Moving 2 steps clockwise from the ptarmigan, we land on the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\n3. Next, we need to move 20 steps clockwise from the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Since the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 20 steps will bring us back to the same dot we were on after the first movement, which is the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Staffordshire Bull Terrier"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
