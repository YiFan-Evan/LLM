Identify the initial positions of the items on the circular path:\n   - Top (starting point): English Setter\n   - Clockwise from there: Wire Fox Terrier, Paintbrush, Jaguar, Swimsuit\n\n2. Recognize the circular nature of the path. Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving one full cycle around the path and ending up at the same spot due to the path having 5 points.\n\n3.
