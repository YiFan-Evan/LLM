Counting 8 steps back from breakwater, we reach the sea slug (since there are only 20 elements, moving counter-clockwise means subtracting from the current position).\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 16 steps clockwise.\n   - From sea slug, moving 16 steps clockwise means moving past several elements until reaching the lawn mower.\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - From lawn mower, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise lands us at the chainsaw.\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Move 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - From chainsaw, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise brings us to the Bloodhound.\n\nNow, let's confirm this step-by-step:\n\n- **Breakwater** is at position 2.\n- Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise: \\(2 - 8 = -6\\). Since we are on a circular map with 20 positions, \\(-6\\) is equivalent to \\(20 - 6 = 14\\), which is the sea slug.\n- Moving 16 steps clockwise from sea slug: \\(14 + 16 = 30\\). On a circular map, \\(30 \\mod 20 = 10\\), which is the lawn mower.\n- Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from lawn mower: \\(10 - 7 = 3\\), which is the chainsaw.\n- Moving 13 steps counter-clockwise from chainsaw: \\(3 - 13 = -10\\). Converting \\(-10\\) to a positive index within the 20 positions gives \\(20 - 10 = 10\\), but since we moved further back, it is actually \\(20 - 10 + 20 = 30 - 10 = 20 - 10 + 20 = 10 - 10 + 20 = 10 -
