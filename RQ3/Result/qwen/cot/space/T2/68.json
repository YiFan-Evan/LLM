Initial Position: Lhasa Apso.\n2. First Movement: Move 1 step clockwise.\n   - From Lhasa Apso (1), moving 1 step clockwise lands on Shield (2).\n3. Second Movement: Move 5 steps clockwise.\n   - From Shield (2), moving 5 steps clockwise lands on Threshing Machine (7).\n4. Third Movement: Move 10 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from Threshing Machine (7) is equivalent to moving 0 steps counter-clockwise because 10 steps is a full circle (10 mod 10 = 0).
