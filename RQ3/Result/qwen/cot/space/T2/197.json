Initial position: mosque.\n2. Move 16 steps clockwise:\n   - The path consists of 20 dots, so moving 16 steps clockwise from the mosque will place you at the dishcloth (since there are 3 steps from the mosque to the dishcloth, and 20 - 16 + 3 = 7, which corresponds to the dishcloth).\n3. Move 18 steps clockwise:\n   - From the dishcloth, moving 18 steps clockwise places you at the safe (since 20 - 18 + 7 = 9, which corresponds to the safe).\n4. Move 5 steps clockwise:\n   - From the safe, moving 5 steps clockwise places you at the goldfinch (since 9 + 5 = 14, which corresponds to the goldfinch).\n5. Move 16 steps clockwise:\n   - From the goldfinch, moving 16 steps clockwise places you at the ruffed grouse (since 14 + 16 = 30, and 30 mod 20 = 10, which corresponds to the ruffed grouse).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ruffed grouse."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
