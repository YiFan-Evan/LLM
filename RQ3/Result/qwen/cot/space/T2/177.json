Move 11 steps clockwise:\n   - 16 + 11 = 27\n   - Since there are only 20 dots, we take 27 mod 20 = 7\n   - Position now: 7th dot (Schipperke)\n3. Move 17 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - 7 - 17 = -10\n   - Since moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to subtracting steps, and we need to stay within the range of 1-20, we add 20 to -10: -10 + 20 = 10\n   - Position now: 10th dot (a sock)\n4. Move 4 steps clockwise:\n   - 10 + 4 = 14\n   - Position now: 14th dot (unicycle)\n5.
