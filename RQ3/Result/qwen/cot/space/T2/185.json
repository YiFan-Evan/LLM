Moving 17 steps clockwise means moving \\(17 \\mod 20 = 17\\) steps.\n3. **Second Movement**: 2 steps clockwise.\n   - From the new position, moving 2 more steps clockwise means moving \\(17 + 2 = 19\\) steps in total.\n4. **Third Movement**: 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise means moving \\(19 - 7 = 12\\) steps clockwise (since moving counter-clockwise subtracts from the total clockwise steps).\n5. **Fourth Movement**: 14 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise means moving \\(12 - 14 = -2\\) steps, which is equivalent to \\(20 - 2 = 18\\) steps clockwise (since moving counter-clockwise past the starting point wraps around).\n\nThus, after all these movements, you end up 18 steps clockwise from the tiger beetle. Now, let's trace this movement from the tiger beetle:\n\n- Tiger beetle (start)\n- Parachute (1 step clockwise)\n- Dowitcher (2 steps clockwise)\n- Black-footed ferret (3 steps clockwise)\n- Tiger beetle (4 steps clockwise, wrapping around)\n- Beagle (5 steps clockwise)\n- Killer whale (6 steps clockwise)\n- Granny Smith (7 steps clockwise)\n- Bedlington Terrier (8 steps clockwise)\n- Stick insect (9 steps clockwise)\n- Green iguana (10 steps clockwise)\n- Samoyed (11 steps clockwise)\n- Partridge (12 steps clockwise)\n- Black and Tan Coonhound (13 steps clockwise)\n- Tank (14 steps clockwise)\n- Windsor tie (15 steps clockwise)\n- Sports car (16 steps clockwise)\n- Tiger cat (17 steps clockwise)\n- Gas mask (18 steps clockwise)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: gas mask"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
