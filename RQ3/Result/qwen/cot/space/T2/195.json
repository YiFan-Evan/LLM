Move 3 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Counter-clockwise movement subtracts from the position.\n   - Position = Sundial - 3\n   - Since there are 20 dots in total, moving counter-clockwise by 3 positions from sundial would put you at the spider web (considering the circular nature).\n\n2. Move 15 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Position = Spider Web - 15\n   - Moving another 15 steps counter-clockwise from spider web puts you 2 positions before the starting point of the circle (since 15 steps counter-clockwise from spider web lands you 3 positions before sundial, then another 2 positions back lands you at the bell-cot).\n\n3. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Position = Bell-cot - 14\n   - Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise from bell-cot would land you at the shopping cart.\n\n4. Move 16 steps clockwise:\n   - Clockwise movement adds to the position.\n   - Position = Shopping Cart + 16\n   - Moving 16 steps clockwise from the shopping cart lands you at the tiger shark (since 16 steps clockwise from shopping cart skips 4 positions ahead in the clockwise direction).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: tiger shark"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
