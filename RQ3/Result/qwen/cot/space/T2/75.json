Since moving counter-clockwise in a circle of 10 means subtracting the steps from the current position, this brings you to position \\(0 - 8 = -8\\). Since positions cannot be negative, we add 10 to get the equivalent positive position: \\(-8 + 10 = 2\\).\n   - Move 3 steps counter-clockwise from position 2. This means subtracting 3 from 2, resulting in \\(2 - 3 = -1\\). Again, converting this to a positive position by adding 10: \\(-1 + 10 = 9\\).\n   - Move 6 steps clockwise from position 9. Clockwise movement means adding the steps to the current position, so \\(9 + 6 = 15\\). Since there are only 10 positions, we take the remainder when dividing by 10: \\(15 \\mod 10 = 5\\).\n\nAfter all the movements, you are at position 5. According to the given sequence, the item at position 5 is a black-and-white colobus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: black-and-white colobus"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
