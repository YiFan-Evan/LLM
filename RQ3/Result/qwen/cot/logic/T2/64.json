Use premise (3): \"Everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus.\"\n   - Since Rex is a jompus (from step 2), Rex is a tumpus (from (3)).\n\n5. Use premise (9): \"Everything that is metallic or a tumpus is a yumpus.\"\n   - We don't have information about whether Rex is metallic, so this doesn't help us directly.\n\n6. Use premise (5): \"Everything that is discordant or a tumpus is a zumpus.\"\n   - Since Rex is a tumpus (from step 4), Rex is a zumpus (from (5)).\n\n7.
