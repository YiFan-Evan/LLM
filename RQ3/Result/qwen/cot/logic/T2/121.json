Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify characteristics of Stella:\n   - From (13): Stella is a rompus.\n   - From (12): Stella is red.\n   - From (16): Stella is large.\n   - From (17): Stella is blue.\n   - From (14): Stella is sweet.\n   - From (15): Stella is a tumpus.\n   - From (18): Stella is small.\n   - From (19): Stella is sour.\n\n2. Combine the relevant premises to derive intermediate conclusions:\n   - From (7): \"Everything that is bright and dull and a rompus is a vumpus.\" Since Stella is a rompus, we need to check if Stella can be a vumpus. However, there is no direct evidence or other premises that allow us to conclude Stella is bright and dull, so we cannot derive Stella as a vumpus directly.\n\n3. Focus on deriving \"Stella is a jompus\":\n   - From (6): \"Everything that is sweet and sour and a tumpus is a jompus.\"\n     - We know from (14) that Stella is sweet.\n     - We know from (19) that Stella is sour.\n     - We know from (15) that Stella is a tumpus.\n     - Therefore, combining these, we can conclude that Stella is a jompus.\n\n4. Now, we need to show that Stella is blue and red and a jompus:\n   - From (17): Stella is blue.\n   - From (12): Stella is red.\n   - From (20): We have already concluded that Stella is a jompus.\n   - Therefore, combining these, we can conclude that Stella is blue and red and a jompus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to derive the conclusion are (13), (15), (17), (19), and (6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (13),(15),(17),(19),(6)->(20)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Stella is sour.
