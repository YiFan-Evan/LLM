However, they don't directly lead to transparency.\n\n6. **Every brimpus is a numpus** (Premise 18).\n7. **Each numpus is cold** (Premise 13).\n\nThese premises confirm that Stella is also a numpus and therefore cold, but again, they don't help us with transparency.\n\n8. **Jompuses are shumpuses** (Premise 14).\n9. **Jompuses are fruity** (Premise 8).\n\nThese premises confirm Stella's properties as a jompus but still do not lead to transparency.\n\n10. **Rompuses are sterpuses** (Premise 19).\n11. **Every rompus is a dumpus** (Premise 10).\n12. **Each dumpus is a zumpus** (Premise 21).\n\nThese premises show the relationship between rompuses and other types of pus but do not directly connect to transparency.\n\n13. **Rompuses are transparent** (Premise 15).\n\nThis is the key premise that connects to transparency.
