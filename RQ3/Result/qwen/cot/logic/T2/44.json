From (1) we know that gorpuses are shumpuses, and since Alex is a gorpus (10), Alex is indeed a shumpus. But there's no direct link between being a shumpus and being a jompus.\n   \n2.

However, from (2) we know every zumpus is a vumpus. There's no information connecting Alex to being a vumpus or a zumpus directly.\n\nSince Alex is not a numpus (10), Alex cannot be a brimpus, because being a brimpus requires being a numpus (among other conditions).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Alex is not a brimpus is (10).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is a lempus and Alex is not a numpus and Alex is a gorpus.
