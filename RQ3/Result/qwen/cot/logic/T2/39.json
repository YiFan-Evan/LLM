We start with the information about Max:\n   - Premise (11): Max is a jompus or a tumpus or a shumpus.\n   - Premise (12): Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus.\n\n2. Since both statements about Max cover the possibility of Max being a jompus or a tumpus, let's focus on those possibilities first.\n\n3. From premise (11), if Max is a jompus, then from premise (4), every jompus is a yumpus. Therefore, Max would be a yumpus.\n   \n4. From premise (11), if Max is a tumpus, then from premise (7), every tumpus is a yumpus. Therefore, Max would be a yumpus.\n   \n5. From premise (11), if Max is a shumpus, then from premise (3), shumpuses are yumpuses. Therefore, Max would be a yumpus.\n   \n6. From premise (12), if Max is a lorpus, then from premise (9), lorpuses are numpuses. However, this does not directly tell us anything about whether Max is a yumpus.\n\n7. From premise (12), if Max is a jompus, then as mentioned before, Max would be a yumpus due to premise (4).\n   \n8. From premise (12), if Max is a tumpus, then as mentioned before, Max would be a yumpus due to premise (7).\n\nSince the only premises directly connecting to yumpuses are those involving jompuses, tumpuses, and shumpuses, we need to consider these cases. As we have seen, if Max is any of these, then Max must be a yumpus.\n\nThus, we need premises (3), (4), (7), and (11) to establish that Max is a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (3),(4),(7),(11)->(13)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus.

Here\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Premises involving Max**:\n   - Premise (1): Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus.\n   - Premise (2): Max is a jompus or a tumpus or a shumpus.\n\n2. **Analyze each case for Max**:\n   - If Max is a lorpus, from Premise (4), lorpuses are numpuses. However, this does not directly tell us about yumpuses.\n   - If Max is a jompus, from Premise (9), every jompus is a yumpus.

Therefore, Max would be a yumpus.\n   - If Max is a shumpus, from Premise (10), shumpuses are yumpuses. Therefore, Max would be a yumpus.\n\n3. **Conclusion from the analysis**:\n   - Given Premises (1) and (2), Max can be either a lorpus, jompus, tumpus, or shumpus.\n   - From the above analysis, if Max is a jompus, tumpus, or shumpus, he is definitely a yumpus.\n   - If Max is a lorpus, we need additional information to conclude that he is a yumpus. However, since the other possibilities (jompus, tumpus, shumpus) already guarantee that Max is a yumpus, we do not need Premise (4) to establish this.\n\nThus, we need the premises that establish the yumpus nature directly from the possible classifications of Max:\n- Premise (9) to handle the case of jompus.\n- Premise (6) to handle the case of tumpus.\n- Premise (10) to handle the case of shumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(9),(10)->(13)"}]
