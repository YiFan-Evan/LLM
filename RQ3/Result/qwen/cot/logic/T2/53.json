This is already stated in (13).\n   - From (2), (6), and (9), using (10): Since Max is a yumpus, an impus, and a lempus, he must be a vumpus. However, this doesn't directly help us with the goal of proving Max is not a numpus.\n\n3. **Analyze the constraints on being a brimpus**:\n   - From (11): If something is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus, it cannot be a grimpus. Since Max satisfies these conditions, he cannot be a grimpus.\n   - But since Max is already a brimpus (from (13)), we know he is not a grimpus. So, the premises involving grimpus do not directly affect our proof.\n\n4. **Consider the premises about numpus**:\n   - From (8): If something is a dumpus, a numpus, or a vumpus, it must be a rompus. This means if Max were a numpus, he would also have to be a rompus.\n   - From (4) and (5): If something is a sterpus, a numpus, or a shumpus, it must be a grimpus and a brimpus. However, since Max is a brimpus and not a grimpus (from (11)), he cannot be any of these.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Max is a brimpus (from (13)) and cannot be a grimpus (from (11)), and since he is not a grimpus, he cannot be a numpus (because being a numpus would imply being a grimpus due to the rules involving grimpus).\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is not a numpus is derived from the premises that establish Max's status as a brimpus and the fact that he cannot be a grimpus.
