From (15): Rex is a grimpus.\n2. From (11): Grimpuses are wumpuses. Therefore, Rex is a wumpus.\n3. We don't have any direct information about wumpuses, so let's focus on Rex being a gorpus.\n4. From (16): Rex is a gorpus.\n5. From (10): Every gorpus is a sterpus. Therefore, Rex is a sterpus.\n6. We know sterpus properties (from (4)) but they do not directly help us conclude Rex is dull.\n7. Let's look at Rex as a grimpus again.\n8. From (11): Grimpuses are wumpuses. We already know this.\n9. No direct connection between wumpuses and dullness.\n10.
