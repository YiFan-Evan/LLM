From premise (5), if Polly is a grimpus, then Polly is a tumpus.\n4. However, we need to consider whether Polly being earthy could lead us directly to the proof obligation.

From premise (2), since Polly is a lempus, we can conclude that Polly is either dull or a gorpus.\n7. We now need to check if Polly being a gorpus or dull could help us derive the proof obligation. However, there is no direct connection between being a gorpus or dull and being large or a grimpus.\n8. Therefore, the most straightforward path is to use premise (4) directly. Since Polly is a shumpus, Polly must be a grimpus or earthy. If Polly is a grimpus, then by premise (5), Polly is a tumpus. But since we need to prove Polly is large or a grimpus, we can directly use premise (5) if Polly is a grimpus.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed to derive Polly is large or a grimpus is (8) and (4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(4)->(10)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is a lempus.
