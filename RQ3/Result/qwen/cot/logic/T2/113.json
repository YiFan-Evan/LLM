Since Max is a dumpus, this means Max cannot be a numpus at the same time if it were also a tumpus. But we already established that Max is a numpus because he is a brimpus. Thus, Max cannot be a tumpus because being a tumpus would require Max to be a numpus, but being a dumpus precludes Max from being a numpus.\n\nThus, the premises that are necessary to establish that Max is not a tumpus are:\n- Premise 8 (Max is a brimpus)\n- Premise 12 (Max is a dumpus)\n- Premise 2 (Dumpuses are not numpuses)\n- Premise 5 (Brimpuses are numpuses)\n- Premise 7 (Each tumpus is a numpus and a sterpus and a wumpus)\n\nBy combining these, we can conclude that Max is not a tumpus.
