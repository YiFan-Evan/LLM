Here's the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. We know Alex is a brimpus (from premise 11).\n2. Brimpuses are sterpuses (from premise 5).\n3. Sterpuses are a type of sterpus (since \"sterpus\" and \"sterpus\" appear to refer to the same concept based on the premises).\n4. From premise 1, everything that is a sterpus or an impus or a jompus is a dumpus. Since Alex is a brimpus and brimpuses are sterpuses (which we treat as sterpus), Alex is a dumpus.\n5. Premise 10 confirms that Alex is a dumpus, which aligns with our previous deduction.\n6. Now we need to see if Alex can be a tumpus. From premise 7, shumpuses are tumpuses and numpuses and vumpuses.\n7. To show Alex is a shumpus, we use premise 9 which states that shumpuses are yumpuses, but we need more specific information.\n8. Premise 4 tells us that everything that is a sterpus or an impus or a jompus is a shumpus. Since Alex is a sterpus (from the earlier steps), Alex is also a shumpus.\n9. Finally, since Alex is a shumpus (from premise 7), and shumpuses are tumpuses, Alex is a tumpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Alex is a tumpus includes premises 5, 1, 11, 7, and 4.
