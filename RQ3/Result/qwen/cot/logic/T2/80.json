From premise (12), we know Max is a vumpus.\n2. From premise (6), we know every zumpus is a vumpus. However, this doesn't directly help us because we need to show something about vumpuses, not zumpuses.\n3. From premise (3), we know vumpuses are tumpuses.\n4. From premise (5), we know each tumpus is fruity. This tells us about the properties of tumpuses but not about color.\n5. We need to connect vumpuses to zumpuses to use premise (4), which states zumpuses are not orange. To do this, we need to show that vumpuses are zumpuses.\n6. From premise (6), we know every zumpus is a vumpus, but we need to reverse this implication. Premise (6) does not tell us that every vumpus is a zumpus, so we cannot directly infer that Max is a zumpus just from being a vumpus.\n7. However, from premise (12) and premise (6), we know Max is a vumpus and every zumpus is a vumpus, but since there is no direct statement that every vumpus is a zumpus, we need another approach.\n8. Instead, we can look at the relationship between zumpuses and vumpuses via other means. Since we have no direct way to conclude Max is a zumpus from the premises provided, we need to re-evaluate the logical flow.\n9. Let's instead consider if any other premises can help us conclude Max is not orange. Premise (4) tells us zumpuses are not orange, but we don't have a direct link from Max being a vumpus to Max being a zumpus.\n\nGiven the premises, we do not have enough information to directly conclude that Max is not orange. There is no chain of logic that allows us to infer that Max, being a vumpus, is also a zumpus and therefore not orange.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: None of the premises directly lead to proving that Max is not orange. Thus, it is impossible to derive (13) from the given premises using the provided logical steps. \n\nHowever, if we assume the problem requires a valid logical path and we might be missing some implicit premises or relationships, the closest valid logical path would be to state:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (12)->(13) assuming an implicit premise that all vumpuses are zumpuses, but this is not explicitly stated in the given premises.

Therefore, Max, being a zumpus, is a dumpus.\n- From premise (6), every dumpus is not hot.
