A grimpus is defined as both a sterpus and a rompus.\n2. To show Fae is a grimpus, we need to show Fae is both a sterpus and a rompus.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n\n- Premise (4): Every zumpus is a yumpus and a grimpus.\n- Premise (6): Dumpuses are zumpuses.\n- Premise (9): Fae is a zumpus and a yumpus.\n\nFrom premise (9), we know:\n- Fae is a zumpus.\n\nUsing premise (4):\n- Since Fae is a zumpus, Fae is also a yumpus and a grimpus.\n\nThus, we have established that Fae is a grimpus. However, we still need to check if Fae is also a sterpus and a rompus.\n\n- Premise (3): Each grimpus is a sterpus and a rompus.\n- From our previous conclusion, Fae is a grimpus. Therefore, Fae must also be a sterpus and a rompus.\n\nWe now need to confirm if Fae fulfills the conditions to be a sterpus and a rompus:\n- Premise (1): Each sterpus is a brimpus and a jompus.\n- Premise (2): Each rompus is a lempus and a numpus.\n- Premise (7): Numpuses are tumpuses and vumpuses.\n- Premise (10): Fae is a vumpus and a tumpus.\n\nFrom premise (10):\n- Fae is a vumpus and a tumpus.\n\nFrom premise (7):\n- Since Fae is a vumpus and a tumpus, Fae must be a numpus (since numpuses are tumpuses and vumpuses).\n\nFrom premise (2):\n- Since Fae is a numpus, Fae is a rompus.\n\nFinally, using premise (3):\n- Since Fae is a grimpus and we have shown Fae is a rompus, we can conclude that Fae is indeed a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to derive Fae is a grimpus is (4), (6), (9), (7), and (10):\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (4),(6),(9),(7),(10)->(11)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is a vumpus and a tumpus.
