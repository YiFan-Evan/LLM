Therefore, we have:\n- Wren is a numpus.\n\nNext, let's consider the definition of a zumpus from premise (3):\n- A zumpus is defined as something that is small, large, and a numpus.\n\nFrom premise (12): Wren is small.\nFrom premise (13): Wren is large.\n\nSince Wren is both small and large and a numpus, Wren must be a zumpus.
