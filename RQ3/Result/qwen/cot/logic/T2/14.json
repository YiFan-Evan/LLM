Premise (5) does not directly say that tumpuses are wumpuses, but we need to see if any other premises imply this.\n\n3. **Rompus to Wumpus Conversion**:\n   - Premises (3), (4), (7), and (11) confirm that numpuses, jompuses, and brimpuses are rompuses, but none of them directly link rompuses to wumpuses except for the identities already covered (jompuses and brimpuses).\n\nSince Stella could be a tumpus, brimpus, jompus, or numpus:\n- If Stella is a jompus or a brimpus, she is a wumpus (premise 12 and 11).\n- If Stella is a numpus, she is a wumpus (premise 6).\n- If Stella is a tumpus, we need to verify if tumpuses are wumpuses.
