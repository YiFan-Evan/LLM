From premises (2) and (12): Since Wren is wooden and a grimpus, it follows that Wren is a brimpus.\n2. From premises (8) and (9): Since Wren is melodic and a grimpus, it follows that Wren is a wumpus.\n3.

From premises (3) and (13): Since Wren is fast and a numpus, it follows that Wren is a gorpus.\n\nThe critical step is to establish that Wren is a numpus and also fast. We already have:\n- Premise (3) states that Wren is fast.\n- Premise (11) states that if something is sweet and a wumpus, it is a numpus. Given premise (5) states Wren is sweet and premise (8) states Wren is a wumpus, it follows that Wren is a numpus.\n\nThus, combining these two facts directly gives us the desired conclusion:\n- Wren is fast and a numpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises required to derive the proof obligation is:\n\n(3),(5),(8),(11)->(18)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (3),(5),(8),(11)->(18)"}]
