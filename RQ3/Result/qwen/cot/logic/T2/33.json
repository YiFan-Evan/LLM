However, since tumpuses are wumpuses, we need to check if there's a connection between wumpuses and gorpuses.\n\nWe now need to establish the relationship between wumpuses and gorpuses:\n- There is no direct premise stating that wumpuses are gorpuses or gorpus. However, we can infer that if Wren is a wumpus and is a specific type of wumpus (yumpus, zumpus, sterpus, lempus), it must be a gorpus because all these types are gorpuses.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Wren is a gorpus are:\n- Premise (1): Wren is a yumpus or a zumpus or a sterpus or a lempus.\n- Premise (9): Each yumpus is a gorpus.\n- Premise (8): Zumpuses are gorpuses.\n- Premise (12): Sterpuses are gorpuses.\n- Premise (13): Each lempus is a gorpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(8),(9),(12),(13)->(16)**"}]
