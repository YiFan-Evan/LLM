Therefore, according to premise (1), Alex is a shumpus.\n- Alternatively, we could also use premises (7), (8), and (13), which indicate that Alex is discordant, melodic, and a yumpus. According to premise (2), Alex would also be a vumpus, but this doesn't help us prove Alex is a shumpus.\n- Premises (11) and (13) show that Alex is snowy and a yumpus, but we need one more characteristic to conclude that Alex is a shumpus, so these alone are insufficient.\n- Premises (9), (11), and (13) show that Alex is an impus, snowy, and a yumpus, but again, we need one more characteristic to conclude that Alex is a shumpus, so these alone are insufficient.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the minimal set of premises that prove Alex is a shumpus are premises (10), (12), and (13).\n\nFinally, we need to verify that Alex is snowy, sunny, and a shumpus. We already have premises (11) and (6) showing that Alex is snowy and sunny respectively, and we've established that Alex is a shumpus using premises (10), (12), and (13).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(12),(13)->(14)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is a yumpus.
