Now we need to show that Rex is red, orange, and brown.\n4. From Premise 6, we know Rex is brown.\n5. From Premise 12, we know Rex is orange.\n6. From Premise 14, we know Rex is red.\n7. Combining these results with Premise 2, since Rex is red, orange, brown, and a lempus, it follows that Rex is a shumpus. However, we only need to prove Rex is red, orange, brown, and a lempus, not necessarily a shumpus.\n\nThe necessary premises to prove Rex is red, orange, brown, and a lempus are:\n- Premise 11 (Rex is a dumpus)\n- Premise 6 (Rex is brown)\n- Premise 12 (Rex is orange)\n- Premise 14 (Rex is red)\n- Premise 1 and 8, 10, 13 (since Rex is muffled, melodic, and discordant, and a dumpus, Rex is a lempus)\n\nSo the minimal set of premises needed is (11), (6), (12), (14), (1), (8), (10), (13).\n\nHowever, since Premise 11 already implies Rex is a dumpus, we don't need to separately state Premise 1, 8, 10, and 13.
