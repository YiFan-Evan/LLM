From premise (16): \"Every zumpus is sweet,\" and since premise (18) tells us that \"Every gorpus is a zumpus,\" we know that if something is a gorpus, it is also a zumpus. However, we don't have any information directly linking Fae to being a gorpus. Instead, we use premise (18) indirectly through the chain of yumpuses and zumpuses.\n4. From premise (14): \"Zumpuses are tumpuses,\" and since premise (17) says \"Numpuses are yumpuses\" and premise (16) says \"Every zumpus is sweet,\" we need to connect Fae to being a zumpus.\n5. From premise (18): \"Every gorpus is a zumpus,\" and premise (20) states \"Fae is a numpus.\" Since premise (17) connects numpuses to yumpuses and there is no direct link between numpuses and gorpuses, we need to find another route.\n6.
