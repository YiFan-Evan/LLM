From Premise (10): Sally is a brimpus.\n2. From Premise (5): Everything that is rainy or a brimpus is a vumpus. Since Sally is a brimpus, she must be a vumpus unless she is rainy.\n3. From Premise (11): Sally is a wumpus.\n4. From Premise (2): Everything that is large or a wumpus is a dumpus. Since Sally is a wumpus, she must be a dumpus.\n5. From Premise (3): Everything that is dull or a lorpus is a brimpus. We don't have direct information about Sally being dull or a lorpus, so we cannot directly use this premise for Sally yet.\n6. From Premise (7): Everything that is slow or a gorpus is a lorpus. Again, no direct information about Sally being slow or a gorpus.\n7. From Premise (8): Everything that is feisty or a gorpus is a numpus. Again, no direct information about Sally being feisty or a gorpus.\n8. From Premise (9): Everything that is opaque or a brimpus is a zumpus. No direct information about Sally being opaque.\n9. From Premise (6): Everything that is brown or a vumpus is a shumpus. We know from Premise (11) that Sally is a wumpus, and from Premise (2) that everything that is large or a wumpus is a dumpus. However, this does not help us directly conclude that Sally is brown or a vumpus.\n10. From Premise (4): Everything that is temperate or a vumpus is a tumpus. This also does not help us directly conclude that Sally is brown or a vumpus.\n11. From Premise (5) again, since Sally is a brimpus, she must be a vumpus unless she is rainy.
