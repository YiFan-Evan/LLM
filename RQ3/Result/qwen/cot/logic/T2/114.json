We start by analyzing the premises to understand the relationships:\n   - From (1), Sam is a wumpus.\n   - From (2), Sam is a gorpus.\n   - From (3), Gorpuses are shumpuses, so Sam is a shumpus (by (2)).\n   - From (5), Sam is a lempus.\n   - From (7), Sam is a tumpus.\n   - From (12), Sam is a yumpus.\n   - From (14), Sam is a rompus.\n   - From (13), Sam is a vumpus and a sterpus and a lempus.\n   \n2. Let's see if there are any contradictions or further conclusions:\n   - From (4), everything that is a wumpus, a tumpus, and a lempus is a vumpus. Since Sam is a wumpus (from (1)), a tumpus (from (7)), and a lempus (from (5)), Sam should be a vumpus. This is consistent with (13).\n   - From (9), everything that is a tumpus, a yumpus, and a rompus is a shumpus. Since Sam is a tumpus (from (7)), a yumpus (from (12)), and a rompus (from (14)), Sam should be a shumpus. This is consistent with (2) and (3).\n\n3. However, we also have (11), which states that Sam is not a shumpus, Sam is a numpus, and Sam is an impus. This contradicts the previous conclusion that Sam is a shumpus.\n   - Given (6), Impuses are sterpuses, so Sam being an impus means Sam is a sterpus (from (11)). This is consistent with (13).\n   - Given (10), Numpuses are lorpuses, so Sam being a numpus means Sam is a lorpus. There is no direct contradiction here but it adds another attribute to Sam.\n\n4. Since Sam cannot simultaneously be a shumpus and not a shumpus, and since being a shumpus is a necessary condition for being a tumpus (based on (9)), we conclude that Sam cannot be a tumpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove Sam is not a tumpus involves the ones that directly link Sam's attributes to the contradiction:\n- (1) Sam is a wumpus.\n- (2) Sam is a gorpus.\n- (5) Sam is a lempus.\n- (7) Sam is a tumpus.\n- (9) Everything that is a tumpus, a yumpus, and a rompus is a shumpus.\n- (11) Sam is not a shumpus, Sam is a numpus, and Sam is an impus.\n- (12) Sam is a yumpus.\n- (14) Sam is a rompus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises leading to the proof is (1), (2), (5), (7), (9), (11), (12), (14) -> (15).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(5),(7),(9),(11),(12),(14)->(15)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sam is a rompus.
