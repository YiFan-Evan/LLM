From the premises, we know:\n\n- Polly is sweet (10).\n- Polly is spicy (8).\n- Polly is a rompus (15).\n\nSince Polly satisfies all three conditions of being sweet, spicy, and a rompus, we can conclude from premise 2 that Polly is a lempus.\n\nNext, we need to show that Polly is dull and bright. We already know from the premises that:\n\n- Polly is bright (11).\n- Polly is dull (13).\n\nThus, Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus.\n\nTo summarize the steps:\n1. Polly is sweet (10).\n2. Polly is spicy (8).\n3. Polly is a rompus (15).\n4. Therefore, Polly is a lempus (by premise 2).\n5. Polly is dull (13).\n6. Polly is bright (11).\n\nThe premises required to derive that Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus are (10), (8), (15), (13), and (11).

Let's analyze the premises and identify the necessary steps.\n\n1. Polly is a rompus (1).\n2. Polly is luminous (2).\n3. Polly is dull (3).\n4. Polly is liquid (4).\n5. Polly is bright (5).\n6. Polly is sweet (6).\n7. Polly is a sterpus (7).\n8. Polly is spicy (8).\n\nWe need to check if Polly meets the criteria for being a lempus. According to premise 14, everything that is sweet, spicy, and a rompus is a lempus. From the premises above, we know that Polly is sweet (6) and spicy (8), and we also know that Polly is a rompus (1). Therefore, Polly satisfies the condition of being a lempus.\n\nHowever, we still need to verify that Polly is dull and bright. Premises 3 and 5 tell us that Polly is indeed dull (3) and bright (5).\n\nNow, let's see if these facts help us conclude that Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus. Premise 12 states that everything that is dull and bright and a lempus is a zumpus. Since Polly is dull (3), bright (5), and a lempus (as derived from premises 6, 8, and 1), it means Polly fits the criteria of premise 12.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus (16) are premises 1, 3, 5, 6, and 8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(5),(6),(8)->(16)."}]
