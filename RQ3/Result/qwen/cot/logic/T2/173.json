Thus, Fae is a shumpus.\n- From (14), Fae is a wumpus, and from (11), every wumpus is a lempus.\n- From (14), Fae is not a rompus.\n\nWe need to check if Fae can be a grimpus or an impus:\n- From (6), grimpuses are tumpuses, yumpuses, and rompuses. Since Fae is not a rompus, Fae cannot be a grimpus.\n- From (12), every impus is a lempus. Since Fae is a wumpus and thus a lempus, Fae could potentially be an impus. However, we need to check if Fae is a zumpus.\n- From (2), if Fae were a zumpus, she would have to be a grimpus, sterpus, or impus. We've already ruled out grimpus. Therefore, Fae would have to be a sterpus or an impus.\n\nHowever, we know that Fae is a shumpus (from (14)) and not a rompus.
