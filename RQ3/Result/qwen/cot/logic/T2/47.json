First, we need to determine if Alex fits the definition of a grimpus.\n   - From premises (1), we know that everything that is overcast, windy, rainy, and a lempus is a grimpus.\n   - We also have the premises (8) Alex is rainy, (10) Alex is overcast, and (13) Alex is windy.\n   - From premise (9) Alex is a lempus, we can combine these to conclude that Alex is a grimpus.\n\n2. Next, we need to check if Alex is feisty, shy, and nervous.\n   - From premise (6) Alex is nervous, (12) Alex is feisty, and (14) Alex is shy, we already have these properties for Alex.\n\n3. Now, using premise (4), we know that everything that is feisty, shy, nervous, and a grimpus is a shumpus.\n   - Since we've established that Alex is feisty, shy, nervous, and a grimpus, it follows from premise (4) that Alex is a shumpus.\n   \nHowever, our goal is to prove that Alex is feisty and shy and nervous and a grimpus.
