From premise (9): Sam is sour, a jompus, and a tumpus.\n2. From premise (7): Every dumpus is sour and a tumpus and a jompus. Since Sam is sour, a jompus, and a tumpus, Sam is a dumpus.\n3.

We know from premise (10) that Sam is a wumpus and floral.\n6. From premise (8): Each lempus is discordant and an impus. Since Sam is floral and a wumpus, Sam is an impus (since every impus is floral and a wumpus).\n7. From premise (1): Every shumpus is opaque, a vumpus, and a rompus. Since Sam is a shumpus (from being an impus), Sam is a shumpus.\n8. From premise (5): Yumpuses are dull and zumpuses and brimpuses. Since Sam is a yumpus (from being a wumpus and premise (10)), Sam is dull.\n9. From premise (4): Wumpuses are shy and gorpuses and yumpuses. Since Sam is a wumpus and a yumpus, and gorpuses are dumpuses (which Sam is), we need to show that Sam is large or a sterpus.\n10. Since gorpuses are defined as large and dumpuses and sterpuses, and since Sam is a dumpus, we need to find if there is any additional information about Sam being large or a sterpus. However, based on the premises given, we do not have direct evidence that Sam is large or a sterpus.\n11. But since gorpuses are defined inclusively as dumpuses, and we already established that Sam is a dumpus, we can infer that Sam could be considered a gorpus because gorpuses include all dumpuses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(9)->(11)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sam is floral, a wumpus, and a yumpus.

Since Sam is sour, a jompus, and a tumpus, Sam is a dumpus.\n4. From premise (9): Gorpuses are large and dumpuses and sterpuses.

Since Sam is a wumpus and a yumpus, Sam is part of the set of wumpuses and yumpuses.\n6. From premise (5): Every impus is floral and a shumpus and a wumpus. Since Sam is floral and a wumpus, Sam could be an impus, but this doesn't directly help us conclude that Sam is a gorpus.\n7. From premise (3): Each lempus is discordant and an impus. This does not apply to Sam directly, as we don't know if Sam is a lempus.\n8. From premise (6): Yumpuses are dull and zumpuses and brimpuses. Since Sam is a yumpus, Sam is dull.\n9.
