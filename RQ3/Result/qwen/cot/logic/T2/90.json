Let's break down the properties of Alex and see if they align with the definition of an impus.\n\nFirst, let's identify the relevant premises:\n- Premise (3): Impuses are floral, fruity, brimpuses, and sterpuses.\n- Premise (8): Alex is sour and sweet and a vumpus and a numpus.\n- Premise (9): Alex is wooden and metallic and a wumpus and a tumpus.\n\nWe need to check if Alex has the necessary properties to be an impus. From premise (3), we know that impuses have the following properties:\n1. Floral\n2. Fruity\n3. Brimpus\n4. Sterpus\n\nFrom premise (8), we know that Alex is:\n1. Sour\n2. Sweet\n3. Vumpus\n4. Numpus\n\nFrom premise (9), we know that Alex is:\n1. Wooden\n2. Metallic\n3. Wumpus\n4. Tumpus\n\nNext, we need to see if Alex satisfies the properties of being a brimpus or a sterpus. Let's look at the definitions of brimpuses and sterpuses:\n- Premise (6): Brimpuses are sour and sweet and numpuses and vumpuses.\n- Premise (not explicitly defined for sterpuses, but it is likely related to the other properties).\n\nFrom premise (6), we can infer that brimpuses are:\n1. Sour\n2. Sweet\n3. Numpuses\n4. Vumpuses\n\nSince Alex is sour, sweet, a vumpus, and a numpus (from premise (8)), Alex satisfies the conditions to be a brimpus. Therefore, Alex is a brimpus.\n\nSince Alex is a brimpus, we now need to check if Alex can also be a sterpus. However, there is no direct information about what constitutes a sterpus, but since sterpus is part of the definition of an impus, and Alex already satisfies the properties of being a brimpus and having the required attributes, we can conclude that Alex is an impus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Alex is an impus would be (8) and (9). However, since we need to show the logical flow, we include (6) as well to connect brimpus to Alex.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(9),(6)->(10)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is wooden and metallic and a wumpus and a tumpus.
