Premise (7) states that zumpuses are grimpuses. However, we don't have enough information to directly conclude that Polly is a zumpus yet. Instead, let's look at premise (8), which states that every vumpus is a yumpus. Since Polly is a yumpus (premise (9)), we need to see if we can link Polly to being a vumpus.\n5.
