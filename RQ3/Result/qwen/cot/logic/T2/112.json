However, there is no direct evidence of Rex being brown.\n\n4. **Premise 10:**\n   - This states that everything that is temperate or a tumpus is a grimpus.\n   - If we can show Rex is either temperate or a tumpus, we can conclude Rex is a grimpus.\n\n5. **Premise 7 again:**\n   - Premise 7 alone does not definitively establish that Rex is a tumpus unless we have additional information about Rex being brown.\n\nGiven the premises, we need to establish that Rex is a tumpus or temperate. The most straightforward way to do this is to use Premise 7 and Premise 2 together to see if we can infer that Rex is a tumpus. Since Premise 7 connects numpus to tumpus via the brown attribute, and we don't have evidence of Rex being brown, we cannot conclusively state Rex is a tumpus based on the premises provided.\n\nHowever, we can still use Premise 10 to prove Rex is temperate or a tumpus. Since Premise 10 directly states that everything that is temperate or a tumpus is a grimpus, we need to find a way to connect Rex to either being temperate or a tumpus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nSince Premise 10 is the key to establishing the proof obligation, we need to consider the minimal premises that allow us to conclude Rex is temperate or a tumpus. The critical premises are:\n\n- **Premise 2:** Rex is a numpus.\n- **Premise 7:** Everything that is brown or a numpus is a tumpus.\n- **Premise 10:** Everything that is temperate or a tumpus is a grimpus.\n\nGiven these premises, we can conclude that Rex is either temperate or a tumpus because Premise 10 covers both cases.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(2),(7),(10)->(12)**"}]
