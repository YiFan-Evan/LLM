We need to see if any of these properties can help us conclude that Stella is not large.\n\nNow, let's examine the premises related to largeness:\n\n- There are no direct premises stating anything about the largeness of lempuses or gorpuses. However, there is a premise involving yumpuses:\n  - (14) Yumpuses are not large.\n\nNext, we need to find a connection between lempuses/gorpuses and yumpuses. Let's look at the relationships provided by other premises:\n\n- (17) Every gorpus is a lorpus.\n- (11) Lorpuses are sterpuses.\n- (16) Sterpuses are jompuses.\n- (18) Every jompus is orange.\n\nThese do not directly relate to yumpuses. Now, let's look for connections involving gorpuses and yumpuses:\n\n- (2) Gorpuses are tumpuses.\n- (8) Sterpuses are yumpuses.\n\nFrom (2), since gorpuses are tumpuses, and from (17), every gorpus is a lorpus, and from (11), lorpuses are sterpuses, we get:\n- (2) Gorpuses are tumpuses -> (17) Every gorpus is a lorpus -> (11) Lorpuses are sterpuses.\n\nNow, we need to connect gorpuses to yumpuses:\n- (8) Sterpuses are yumpuses.\n\nCombining these:\n- Every gorpus is a lorpus (from 17).\n- Lorpuses are sterpuses (from 11).\n- Sterpuses are yumpuses (from 8).\n\nThus, every gorpus is a yumpus. Therefore, Stella, being a gorpus, is also a yumpus.\n\nSince (14) states that yumpuses are not large, we have:\n- Stella is a yumpus (from above derivations) -> Stella is not large (from 14).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive this conclusion is:\n- (2),(17),(11),(8),(14)->(21)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(17),(11),(8),(14)->(21)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

Let's break down the steps and identify the necessary premises:\n\n1. From premise (19): Stella is a lempus.\n2. From premise (20): Stella is a gorpus.\n\nWe need to find a way to link these statements to the statement that \"Stella is not large.\" We don't have a direct relationship between lempuses or gorpuses and largeness. However, we can leverage the fact that gorpuses are linked to yumpuses through a series of logical deductions.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n\n1. **Gorpuses and Lorpuses:**\n   - Premise (17): Every gorpus is a lorpus.\n   - Premise (11): Lorpuses are sterpuses.\n   \n   Thus, every gorpus is a lorpus, and every lorpus is a sterpus.\n\n2. **Sterpuses and Yumpuses:**\n   - Premise (8): Sterpuses are yumpuses.\n   \n   Therefore, every gorpus is a yumpus.\n\n3. **Yumpuses and Largeness:**\n   - Premise (14): Yumpuses are not large.\n   \n   Since Stella is a gorpus, and every gorpus is a yumpus, it follows that Stella is a yumpus. Given that yumpuses are not large, we conclude that Stella is not large.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises Needed:\n\nThe key premises here are those that establish the chain of identities leading from gorpuses to yumpuses and the property of yumpuses being not large. These are:\n\n- (17) Every gorpus is a lorpus.\n- (11) Lorpuses are sterpuses.\n- (8) Sterpuses are yumpuses.\n- (14) Yumpuses are not large.\n\nAdditionally, we need to confirm that Stella is indeed a gorpus, which is given by premise (20).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the conclusion is:\n- (20),(17),(11),(8),(14)->(21)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (20),(17),(11),(8),(14)->(21)"}]
