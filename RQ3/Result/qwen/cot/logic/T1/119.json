Start with premise (9): Max is large, small, a vumpus, and a tumpus.\n2. From premise (10), we know that Max is mean, kind, an impus, and a lorpus.\n3. We need to connect these facts to the definition of a rompus. From premise (4), every rompus is a shumpus, and from premise (1), each shumpus is a grimpus, a jompus, and either opaque or transparent. However, none of these directly help us establish that Max is a rompus.\n4. Instead, let's focus on premise (4) again. It states that every rompus is a shumpus, and from premise (1), we know that each shumpus is also a zumpus and an impus. This means that if something is a rompus, it must also be an impus.\n5. From premise (10), we know Max is an impus. This aligns with the fact that a rompus is an impus.\n6. Next, from premise (4), we see that every rompus is also a shumpus. Premise (1) tells us that each shumpus is a grimpus and a jompus. However, this does not directly help us conclude that Max is a rompus.\n7. We need to check if there is any other connection. Premise (5) states that each wumpus is a lorpus and a rompus. But we do not have information about Max being a wumpus.\n8. Premise (7) states that each impus is an impus, a numpus, a lempus, and an overcast and windy entity. This does not directly help us conclude that Max is a rompus.\n9. Premise (8) tells us that yumpuses are large, small, vumpuses, and tumpuses. This matches premise (9) for Max but does not directly connect to the rompus.\n10. From premise (10), we already know that Max is a lorpus and an impus. Since every rompus is an impus (from premise (4)), we can conclude that Max, being an impus, could potentially be a rompus if we find additional supporting premises. However, the only direct connection we have is through the properties of being an impus.\n\nGiven the premises provided, the only way to directly prove that Max is a rompus is if we assume that being an impus is sufficient to be a rompus. Since premise (4) states that every rompus is an impus, and Max is an impus (from premise (10)), we can conclude that Max is a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (9),(10)->(11)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
