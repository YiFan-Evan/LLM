According to premise (8), everything that is a lorpus and a vumpus and a dumpus is a tumpus. Since Rex is a lorpus (from (1)) and a vumpus (from (15) and (18)) and a dumpus (from (17)), Rex is a tumpus.\n\nPremise (5) states that wumpuses are tumpuses. So, if Rex is a tumpus, Rex could potentially be a wumpus. However, we need to check other conditions to determine if Rex can be a lempus.\n\nPremise (11) states that lempuses are wumpuses. So, if Rex were a lempus, Rex would also be a wumpus. But we need to check if Rex can actually be a lempus based on the other premises.\n\nPremise (2) states that every wumpus is a lempus and a gorpus and an impus. Premise (3) states that each gorpus is a rompus. Premise (7) states that each lempus is a rompus. Premise (16) states that each lempus is a dumpus. If Rex were a lempus, Rex would be an impus because every wumpus is an impus. However, premise (13) states that shumpuses are not impuses. From premise (6), everything that is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus is a shumpus. Since Rex is a vumpus, numpus, and yumpus, Rex is a shumpus. Therefore, Rex cannot be an impus. But since every wumpus is an impus, Rex cannot be a wumpus, and thus cannot be a lempus.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Rex is not a lempus is:\n- (1), (12), (15), (18), (19), (20), (17), (5), (2), (3), (7), (13), (6)\n\nThe proof obligation can be derived from these premises.
