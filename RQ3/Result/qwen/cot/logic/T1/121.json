Stella is sour (19).\n\nFrom these statements, we can derive intermediate conclusions using the premises provided:\n\n- Since Stella is a rompus (13) and it is bright and dull (implied by being a rompus and combining with (7)), it cannot directly help us reach the conclusion about being blue and red and a jompus.\n- Since Stella is a tumpus (15) and it is shy and happy (implied by being a tumpus and combining with (5)), it also doesn't directly help us reach the conclusion about being blue and red and a jompus.\n- Stella is sweet (14) and sour (19), which means she is sweet and sour and a tumpus (15).
