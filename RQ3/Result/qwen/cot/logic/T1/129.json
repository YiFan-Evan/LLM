From premises (6) and (9), Alex is a lempus and Alex is feisty. Using premise (1), we can infer that Alex is a zumpus because everything that is feisty and a lempus is a zumpus.\n   - This step is unnecessary for proving Alex is earthy and a grimpus.\n   \n2. From premises (6) and (10), Alex is a lempus and Alex is amenable. Using premise (2), we can infer that Alex is a grimpus because everything that is amenable and a lempus is a grimpus.\n   - This is a key step because it establishes that Alex is a grimpus.\n   \n3. From premise (7), Alex is earthy. Combining this with the result from step 2, we can infer that Alex is earthy and a grimpus because everything that is earthy and a grimpus is a gorpus (though this is not needed for the specific proof obligation).\n\nSo, the critical premises needed are (6), (10), and (7):\n\n- Premise (6) establishes that Alex is a lempus.\n- Premise (10) establishes that Alex is amenable.\n- Premise (7) establishes that Alex is earthy.\n\nFrom these three premises, we can conclude that Alex is earthy and a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(10),(7)->(11)"}]
