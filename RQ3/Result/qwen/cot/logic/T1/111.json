Let's break it down step-by-step using the given premises:\n\n1. From premises (16) and (17), we know Wren is both a shumpus and a yumpus.\n2. However, these do not directly help us prove that Wren is a dumpus since we need to find a connection to dumpus through other premises.\n3.

We need to check if Wren meets these conditions.\n   - Premise (10) tells us Wren is liquid.\n   - Premise (15) tells us Wren is luminous.\n   - Premise (11) tells us Wren is wooden.\n   - Premise (17) tells us Wren is a yumpus.\n4. Since Wren is already a yumpus (premise 17), we need to check if Wren can also be a dumpus. \n5. Premise (2) tells us that everything that is \"fast, slow, and moderate and a yumpus\" is a dumpus.\n   - Premise (12) tells us Wren is fast.\n   - Premise (9) tells us Wren is slow.\n   - Premise (14) tells us Wren is moderate.\n6.

Now, using premise (7), we know that everything that is \"liquid, luminous, wooden, and a dumpus\" is a numpus. But since we already have the properties of liquid, luminous, wooden, and dumpus for Wren, we don't need to go further to prove that Wren is a numpus; instead, we just need to confirm the properties themselves.\n\nThus, we have established that Wren is indeed liquid, luminous, wooden, and a dumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(15),(11),(17),(12),(9),(14),(2)->(19)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
