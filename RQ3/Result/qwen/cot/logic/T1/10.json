Let's analyze each premise and its relevance to the proof obligation.\n\n### Analysis of Premises:\n1. **Every mother has a son.** \n   - This premise is irrelevant to the proof obligation about Polly being a brimpus or wumpus.\n\n2. **Everything that is a grimpus or a tumpus is a yumpus.**\n   - This premise tells us about the relationship between grimpuses, tumpuses, and yumpuses but doesn't directly affect Polly's status as a brimpus or wumpus.\n\n3. **Everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a yumpus.**\n   - This premise states that if something is a wumpus or a brimpus, it must be a yumpus. This is crucial because Polly is not a yumpus (premise 4).\n\n4. **Everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a gorpus.**\n   - This premise tells us that if something is a wumpus or a brimpus, it must be a gorpus. However, this doesn't directly help in proving Polly is not a wumpus or brimpus.\n\n5. **Polly is not a yumpus.**\n   - This is a direct contradiction to premises 2 and 3, implying Polly cannot be a wumpus or a brimpus.\n\n6. **Polly is not a shumpus.**\n   - This premise is irrelevant as there is no mention of \"shumpus\" elsewhere in the premises.\n\n### Deriving the Proof Obligation:\nGiven that Polly is not a yumpus (premise 4), we can use premises 2 and 3 to conclude:\n- If Polly were a wumpus or a brimpus, she would be a yumpus (from premise 2).\n- Since Polly is not a yumpus, she cannot be a wumpus or a brimpus.\n\nTherefore, the premises needed to derive the proof obligation are premises 2, 3, and 4.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal set of premises required to prove Polly is not a brimpus and not a wumpus is premises 2, 3, and 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(2),(3),(4)->(6)**"}]
