Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. From premise (23), we know Max is a brimpus.\n2. From premise (24), we know Max is a jompus.\n3. Since every jompus is a sterpus (premise 4), Max is a sterpus.\n4. Since every brimpus is a dumpus (premise 14), Max is a dumpus.\n5. Since every dumpus is rainy (premise 18), Max is rainy.\n6. Since every lorpus is a numpus (premise 17), and every numpus is a grimpus (premise 9), and every grimpus is a vumpus (premise 3), and every vumpus is orange (premise 3), we can see that lorpuses have some characteristics but none directly relating to being cold.\n7. Since every lorpus is not cold (premise 22), and every brimpus is a tumpus (premise 15), and every tumpus is a lorpus (premise 1), Max, being a brimpus, is a lorpus.\n8.
