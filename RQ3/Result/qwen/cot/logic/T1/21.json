From premise (19): Polly is a tumpus.\n2. From premise (6): Tumpuses are dumpuses. Therefore, Polly is a dumpus.\n3. However, dumpuses are not directly related to being floral or not floral. We need to look at other premises to find the link.\n4. From premise (19): Polly is a tumpus.\n5. From premise (18): Every tumpus is not dull. Therefore, Polly is not dull.\n6. But this doesn't help us with the floral characteristic either. Let's check the yumpus information.\n7. From premise (20): Polly is a yumpus.\n8. From premise (12): Each yumpus is a shumpus. Therefore, Polly is a shumpus.\n9. From premise (16): Every shumpus is an impus. Therefore, Polly is an impus.\n10. From premise (8): Each impus is melodic. Therefore, Polly is melodic.\n11. But again, melodic does not relate to floral. Now, let's look at the lempus and wumpus information.\n12. From premise (12): Each yumpus is a shumpus.\n13. From premise (13): Every shumpus is a lempus. Therefore, Polly is a lempus.\n14. From premise (14): Every lempus is a wumpus. Therefore, Polly is a wumpus.\n15. From premise (1): Each wumpus is a grimpus. Therefore, Polly is a grimpus.\n16. But none of these directly connect to being floral. We need to go back to the yumpus information.\n17. From premise (11): Each yumpus is feisty. Therefore, Polly is feisty.\n18. Still, feisty does not help us with floral. Let's consider the shumpus and lempus information again.\n19. From premise (3): Each shumpus is aggressive. Therefore, Polly is aggressive.\n20. But aggressive does not help us with floral. Finally, let's consider the lempus and wumpus information.\n21. From premise (2): Lempuses are gorpuses. Therefore, Polly is a gorpus.\n22. From premise (17): Every gorpus is bitter. Therefore, Polly is bitter.\n23.
