Therefore, if Wren is a dumpus, Wren is an impus.\n- **Tumpus**: From premise 11, tumpuses are impuses. Therefore, if Wren is a tumpus, Wren is an impus.\n- **Numpus**: From premise 6, numpuses are impuses. Therefore, if Wren is a numpus, Wren is an impus.\n\nSince Wren is either a dumpus, a tumpus, or a numpus (or a yumpus, but yumpuses being sterpuses does not directly help since we need to check sterpus -> impus conversion, which is not provided), and all these cases lead to Wren being an impus, we conclude that Wren must be an impus.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\n- Premise 6 (Numpuses are impuses)\n- Premise 8 (Dumpuses are impuses)\n- Premise 11 (Tumpuses are impuses)\n- Premise 14 (Wren is a yumpus or a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus)\n\nThus, combining these premises allows us to conclude that Wren is an impus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(6),(8),(11),(14)->(16)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
