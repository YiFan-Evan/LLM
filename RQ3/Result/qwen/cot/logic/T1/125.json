Since impuses are wumpuses (premise 5), Rex being an impus means Rex is a wumpus (which is already known).\n\nNow let's consider the implications if Rex were a grimpus:\n- If Rex is a grimpus, then combining it with the facts that Rex is a shumpus and Rex is a yumpus (from 13), by premise 1, Rex would be a brimpus.\n- But premise 10 states that Rex is not a brimpus. Therefore, Rex cannot be a grimpus.\n\nThus, we can derive that Rex is not a grimpus by contradiction.\n\nThe key premises needed to derive this conclusion are:\n- Premise 1 (to establish the relationship involving grimpus)\n- Premise 10 (to establish Rex is not a brimpus)\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises that lead to proving Rex is not a grimpus is premise 1 and premise 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(10)->(14)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
