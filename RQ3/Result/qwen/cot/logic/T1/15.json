Let's analyze the premises step-by-step.\n\n1. We know that Wren is either a shumpus, jompus, zumpus, or brimpus from premise (14).\n2. We also know that Wren is either a jompus, zumpus, brimpus, or tumpus from premise (15).\n\nCombining these two premises, we get that Wren must be one of the following: shumpus, jompus, zumpus, brimpus, or tumpus.\n\nNext, let's look at the implications of each of these possibilities:\n\n- If Wren is a shumpus (from premise (14)), then by premise (3), Wren is a grimpus.\n- If Wren is a jompus (from premise (15)), then by premise (12), Wren is a grimpus.\n- If Wren is a zumpus (from premise (14)), then by premise (11), Wren is a grimpus.\n- If Wren is a brimpus (from premise (15)), then by premise (8), Wren is a grimpus.\n- If Wren is a tumpus (from premise (15)), then by premise (9), Wren is a grimpus.\n\nSo, in all cases, Wren is a grimpus. Now we need to see if being a grimpus implies being a rompus.\n\nFrom the premises, we have:\n- Premise (3): Each shumpus is a grimpus.\n- Premise (8): Each brimpus is a grimpus.\n- Premise (9): Every tumpus is a grimpus.\n- Premise (11): Every zumpus is a grimpus.\n- Premise (12): Every jompus is a grimpus.\n\nNone of these premises directly state that being a grimpus implies being a rompus. However, we can infer this indirectly through other premises:\n- Premise (1): Each zumpus is a rompus.\n- Premise (2): Numpuses are rompuses.\n- Premise (4): Tumpuses are rompuses.\n- Premise (6): Every yumpus is a rompus.\n- Premise (7): Each brimpus is a rompus.\n- Premise (10): Each jompus is a rompus.\n- Premise (13): Each wumpus is a rompus.\n\nSince we know Wren is a grimpus, and from premises (7), (10), and (13), we know that if Wren were a brimpus, jompus, or wumpus, Wren would be a rompus. However, since we don't have specific premises linking shumpus or tumpus directly to rompus, we need to find a common thread.\n\nThe key here is to use the most direct links:\n- From premise (14), Wren is a shumpus or jompus or zumpus or brimpus.\n- From premise (15), Wren is a jompus or zumpus or brimpus or tumpus.\n- From premise (7), brimpus is a rompus.\n- From premise (10), jompus is a rompus.\n- From premise (11), zumpus is a grimpus and from premise (1), zumpus is a rompus.\n- From premise (3), shumpus is a grimpus and from premise (8), grimpus is a brimpus, and from premise (7), brimpus is a rompus.\n\nThus, we can conclude that regardless of which type Wren is, Wren will be a rompus. Therefore, we need the premises (1), (3), (7), (8), (10), (11), (14), and (15) to derive the conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(7),(8),(10),(11),(14),(15)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the logical reasoning process:\n\n1. **Identify Wren's Possible Types**:\n   - From premise (14): Wren is a shumpus, jompus, zumpus, or brimpus.\n   - From premise (15): Wren is a jompus, zumpus, brimpus, or tumpus.\n   \n   Combining these two premises, Wren must be one of the following: shumpus, jompus, zumpus, brimpus, or tumpus.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Type**:\n   - If Wren is a shumpus, then by premise (3), Wren is a grimpus.\n   - If Wren is a jompus, then by premise (12), Wren is a grimpus.\n   - If Wren is a zumpus, then by premise (11), Wren is a grimpus.\n   - If Wren is a brimpus, then by premise (8), Wren is a grimpus.\n   - If Wren is a tumpus, then by premise (9), Wren is a grimpus.\n\n   So, in all cases, Wren is a grimpus.\n\n3. **Link Grimpus to Rompus**:\n   - Premises about grimpuses leading to rompuses:\n     - From premise (11): Every zumpus is a grimpus, and by premise (1), every zumpus is a rompus.\n     - From premise (8): Every brimpus is a grimpus, and by premise (7), every brimpus is a rompus.\n     - From premise (12): Every jompus is a grimpus, and by premise (10), every jompus is a rompus.\n     - From premise (9): Every tumpus is a grimpus, and by premise (4), every tumpus is a rompus.\n     - From premise (3): Every shumpus is a grimpus, but there is no direct link from grimpus to rompus for shumpus.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   Since Wren is a grimpus and based on the premises, we can conclude that if Wren is a zumpus, jompus, brimpus, or tumpus, then Wren is a rompus.
