Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. From premise (6), we know that Max is a tumpus.\n2. From premise (3), we know that everything that is a tumpus is a lorpus (since being a tumpus is one of the conditions that make something a lorpus).\n3. From premise (2), we know that everything that is a lorpus is a gorpus, but this does not help us directly with proving that Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus.\n4.

Premise (7) tells us that Max is a sterpus, but this does not help us directly either.\n\nSo, the key points are:\n- From premise (6), we know Max is a tumpus.\n- From premise (3), since Max is a tumpus, Max is a lorpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus is premise (6) and premise (3).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(3)->(8)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

Therefore, since Max is a tumpus (from premise (6)), Max is a lorpus.\n3. **Premise (2)**: Everything that is a lorpus is a gorpus.
