Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Premise (10):** Alex is orange, a lempus, and a gorpus.\n2. **Premise (1):** Numpuses are orange and vumpuses and lempuses.\n   - From (10), since Alex is orange and a lempus, it is possible that Alex is a numpus.\n3. **Premise (2):** Each grimpus is loud and a numpus.\n   - This doesn't directly help us with Alex, but it tells us about the characteristics of grimpuses.\n4. **Premise (5):** Lempuses are floral, gorpuses, and sterpuses.\n   - From (10), Alex is a lempus, so Alex is floral, a gorpus, and a sterpus.\n5. **Premise (10):** Alex is orange, a lempus, and a gorpus.\n   - We already used this premise to establish that Alex is a lempus and a gorpus.\n6. **Premise (3):** Sterpuses are transparent and brimpuses and dumpuses.\n   - From (5), we know Alex is a sterpus, and from (3), sterpuses are transparent, brimpuses, and dumpuses.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that the premises (10) and (5) together are sufficient to conclude that Alex is a sterpus.
