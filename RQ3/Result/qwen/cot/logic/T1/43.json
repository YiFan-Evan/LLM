Max is a yumpus, a brimpus, and a gorpus.\n\nFrom these premises, we can derive the following conclusions about Max:\n- Since Max is a tumpus (premise 3), this is already part of our proof obligation.\n- Since every numpus is a zumpus (premise 6) and Max is a numpus (premise 4), Max is a zumpus. This is already confirmed in premise 2.\n- Since Max is a numpus (premise 4) and every numpus is a tumpus (premise 6), Max is a tumpus. This is already confirmed in premise 3.\n- Since Max is a jompus (premise 5), and every numpus is a shumpus (premise 3 implies it since every numpus is a shumpus, but not explicitly stated; however, since Max is a numpus, he must be a shumpus through the chain of premises), Max is a shumpus.\n- Since Max is a wumpus (premise 7), an impus (premise 6), and a jompus (premise 5), Max is a rompus (premise 9).\n\nThus, combining all the relevant premises and derived facts, we have:\n- Max is a tumpus (premise 3).\n- Max is a shumpus (derived from being a numpus and the fact that every numpus is a shumpus).\n- Max is a rompus (premise 9).\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation is:\n- Premise 3: Max is a tumpus.\n- Premise 4: Max is a numpus.\n- Premise 5: Max is a jompus.\n- Premise 6: Every numpus is a shumpus.\n- Premise 7: Max is a wumpus.\n- Premise 9: Every wumpus, impus, and jompus is a rompus.\n\nSo the minimal set of premises is (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9) -> (17).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(9)->(17)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
