However, based on the given premises, there isn't a direct link from a rompus to a lempus. Instead, we need to look at the definition of a lempus, which is provided by premise (2):\n- Premise (2): Everything that is sweet, spicy, and a rompus is a lempus.\n\nSince Polly is sweet (premise (8)), spicy (premise (9)), and a rompus (premise (15)), Polly satisfies all conditions to be a lempus according to premise (2).\n\nThus, we have established that Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus. To summarize the necessary premises leading to this conclusion:\n\n- Premise (15): Polly is a rompus.\n- Premise (13): Polly is dull.\n- Premise (11): Polly is bright.\n- Premise (8): Polly is spicy.\n- Premise (10): Polly is sweet.\n- Premise (2): Everything that is sweet, spicy, and a rompus is a lempus.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises required to prove that Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus is (15),(13),(11),(8),(10),(2).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (15),(13),(11),(8),(10),(2)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
