We start with the fact that Fae is a zumpus (premise 11).\n2. We know from premise 4 that everything that is nervous and a zumpus is a sterpus.\n3. Since Fae is nervous (premise 12), it follows that Fae is a sterpus.\n4. To prove that Fae is overcast and a sterpus, we need to establish that Fae is overcast. However, there is no direct connection between Fae being a sterpus and Fae being overcast.\n5. But we have the information that Fae is a grimpus (premise 15) and Fae is a brimpus (premise 16).\n6. From premise 3, we know that everything that is cold and a brimpus is a lempus. Since Fae is cold (premise 13), Fae is a lempus.\n7. There is no direct link between Fae being a lempus and Fae being overcast or a sterpus.\n8. Instead, we need to look at the relationship between being a brimpus and being a zumpus. Premise 2 states that everything that is mean and a brimpus is a zumpus. Since Fae is mean (premise 17), Fae is a zumpus, but this has already been established in premise 11.\n9. To connect Fae being a brimpus to being overcast and a sterpus, we need to use the premises in a different way. Premise 1 connects being overcast and a sterpus directly to being a dumpus, but there is no direct link between being a brimpus and being a dumpus.\n10. Given the above analysis, we need to find the minimal set of premises that can lead us to conclude that Fae is overcast and a sterpus. The key here is to focus on the premises that directly relate to being a sterpus and being overcast.\n11. The key premises are:\n    - Premise 11: Fae is a zumpus.\n    - Premise 12: Fae is nervous.\n    - Premise 4: Everything that is nervous and a zumpus is a sterpus.\n    - Premise 10: Fae is overcast.\n\nFrom these premises, we can derive that Fae is a sterpus (from premises 11 and 12 using premise 4), and since Fae is also overcast (premise 10), we can conclude that Fae is overcast and a sterpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed is: (10), (11), (12), (4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(11),(12),(4)->(18)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
