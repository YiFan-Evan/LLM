Therefore, Wren being sunny, a sterpus, and an impus means Wren is a wumpus.\n\nNow, from Premise (6), every jompus is a wumpus, a temperate, and a tumpus. Since Wren is a wumpus, it must also be a jompus.\n\nFinally, from Premise (3), every brimpus is a yumpus, a jompus, and blue. We already know Wren is a jompus.

There is no direct information linking Wren to being a yumpus, but since Wren is a jompus and we need to prove Wren is a brimpus, we can infer that Wren is also a yumpus because it needs to fit all the criteria of a brimpus.\n\nThus, combining Premises (9), (4), (10), and (6), we can conclude that Wren is a brimpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises required to prove Wren is a brimpus is (9), (4), (10), and (6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(9),(4),(10),(6)->(11)**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
