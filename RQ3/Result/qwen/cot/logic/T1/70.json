Since jompuses are lorpuses (premise (4)), Max is also a lorpus.\n4. Since every dumpus is a wumpus (premise (2)), Max is also a wumpus.\n5. From premise (5), since Max is a tumpus, it follows that Max is a brimpus.\n\nHowever, none of these conclusions directly lead to Max being a rompus, grimpus, or numpus. The only relevant information we have is that Max is a grimpus. Therefore, we can conclude that Max is a grimpus, which satisfies the requirement of being a grimpus or a rompus or a numpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is a rompus or a grimpus or a numpus includes premises (3), (5), and (7):\n\n- Premise (7) tells us Max is a tumpus.\n- Premise (3) tells us that if Max is a tumpus, then Max is a grimpus.\n- Premise (5) is not strictly necessary for this particular proof but is included to show that Max is also a brimpus, though not directly relevant to the proof.\n\nSo the minimal set of premises required is (7), (3), and (5).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (7),(3),(5)->(8)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
