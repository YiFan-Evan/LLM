Here is the detailed reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Max's Properties**:\n   - From premise (23), Max is a brimpus.\n   - From premise (24), Max is a gorpus.\n\n2. **Derive Intermediate Conclusions**:\n   - From premise (6), every brimpus is a numpus. Therefore, since Max is a brimpus, Max is a numpus.\n   - From premise (12), each numpus is a lempus. Therefore, since Max is a numpus, Max is a lempus.\n   - From premise (19), lempuses are zumpuses. Therefore, since Max is a lempus, Max is a zumpus.\n   - From premise (21), zumpuses are shumpuses. Therefore, since Max is a zumpus, Max is a shumpus.\n   - From premise (22), zumpuses are wumpuses. Therefore, since Max is a zumpus, Max is a wumpus.\n   - From premise (20), every wumpus is a lorpus. Therefore, since Max is a wumpus, Max is a lorpus.\n   - From premise (8), every wumpus is not moderate. Therefore, since Max is a wumpus, Max is not moderate.\n\nThe key premises leading directly to proving that Max is not moderate are (20) and (8). Specifically, (20) establishes that every wumpus is a lorpus, and (8) states that every wumpus is not moderate. Since Max is a wumpus, he must also be not moderate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (20),(8)->(25)"}]
