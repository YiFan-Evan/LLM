From Premises (9), (11), (12), and (15), Rex is sunny, snowy, rainy, and a dumpus. By Premise (3), everything that is sunny, snowy, rainy, and a dumpus is a brimpus. Therefore, Rex is a brimpus.\n5. Combining all these results, Rex is amenable, aggressive, mean, angry, and a brimpus.\n\nSince Rex meets all the criteria mentioned in Premise (1), which states that everything that is amenable, aggressive, mean, angry, and a brimpus is a rompus, we do not need to derive a rompus but rather confirm that Rex fits the definition of a brimpus.\n\nThus, the proof obligation (19) can be derived from the premises (6), (7), (13), (15), (16), (9), (11), (12), and (14).\n\nHowever, since we only need to prove Rex is amenable, aggressive, mean, angry, and a brimpus, we don't need the additional premises about being a dumpus or a sterpus.
