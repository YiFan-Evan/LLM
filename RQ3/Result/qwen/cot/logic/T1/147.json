Max is a rompus.\n\nFrom premises 1 and 2:\n- Since Max is a wumpus (Premise 8) and Max is happy (Premise 9), according to Premise 1, Max is a shumpus (shumpus = happy and wumpus).\n\nFrom premise 3:\n- Max is metallic (Premise 10).\n\nNow we have:\n- Max is a shumpus (from Premises 1 and 2).\n- Max is metallic (Premise 10).\n\nAccording to Premise 7, everything that is fast and a shumpus is a sterpus. However, there is no information about Max being fast, so we cannot derive that Max is a sterpus.\n\nNext, let's check if we can use other premises:\n- From Premise 4, Max is bitter and a wumpus (Premise 8), so according to Premise 4, Max is a numpus. But again, we don't need this information for our conclusion.\n- From Premise 5, Max is a tumpus (Premise 12), but this does not help us derive that Max is metallic and a shumpus.\n- From Premise 6, Max is snowy (Premise 13), and according to Premise 6, snowy and rompus means wumpus, but we already know Max is a wumpus.\n- From Premise 7, Max is blue (Premise 14), and according to Premise 5, blue and rompus means impus, but again, this is irrelevant to our conclusion.\n- From Premise 8, Max is a rompus (Premise 15), and according to Premise 5, snowy and rompus means wumpus, but we already know Max is a wumpus.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises that allow us to conclude that Max is metallic and a shumpus are:\n- Max is a wumpus (Premise 8).\n- Max is happy (Premise 9).\n- Max is metallic (Premise 10).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed is (8), (9), and (10), which lead to the conclusion that Max is metallic and a shumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(9),(10)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
