Lempuses are wumpuses.\n2. Sally is a lempus.\n3. Shumpuses are gorpuses.\n4. Every shumpus is a brimpus, an impus, and a wumpus.\n5. Vumpuses are numpuses.\n6. Each brimpus is a rompus.\n7. Brimpuses are lempuses.\n8. Impuses are dumpuses.\n9. Sally is a gorpus, a jompus, and a lorpus.\n10. Sally is a vumpus and Sally is not a wumpus and Sally is a brimpus.\n\nFrom these premises, let's derive the necessary steps to prove that Sally is not a shumpus:\n\n- From (2) and (1), since Sally is a lempus and lempuses are wumpuses, we conclude that Sally is a wumpus. However, this contradicts (10) which states that Sally is not a wumpus. This contradiction means that some premises may lead to conflicting conclusions about Sally's properties, but our main goal is to show that Sally cannot be a shumpus.\n  \n- From (10), we know Sally is a brimpus. Since brimpuses are lempuses (from (7)), and lempuses are wumpuses (from (1)), Sally is also a wumpus. But again, this contradicts (10).\n\n- From (4), every shumpus is a brimpus, an impus, and a wumpus. Since Sally is a brimpus (from (10)), if she were a shumpus, she would also have to be an impus and a wumpus.\n\n- From (10), Sally is not a wumpus. Therefore, if Sally were a shumpus, she would be a wumpus, which contradicts (10).\n\nThus, to prove that Sally is not a shumpus, we only need premises (4), (10), and (2):\n\n- (2) tells us Sally is a lempus.\n- (10) tells us Sally is a brimpus but not a wumpus.\n- (4) tells us that any shumpus must be a wumpus.\n\nSo combining these, we see that Sally cannot be a shumpus because being a shumpus would imply being a wumpus, which contradicts (10).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(10),(4)->(11)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
