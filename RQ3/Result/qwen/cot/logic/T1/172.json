From premise (20): Fae is a numpus.\n2. From premise (17): Numpuses are yumpuses. Therefore, Fae is a yumpus.\n3. From premise (16): Every zumpus is sweet. Since zumpuses are lorpuses (premise 2), and lorpuses are not wooden (premise 3), but this doesn't directly help us conclude Fae is sweet, we need to focus on the yumpuses.\n4. Premise (10): Yumpuses are not opaque. This doesn't directly tell us about sweetness.\n5. However, premise (16) states that every zumpus is sweet. Since zumpuses are lorpuses and lorpuses are not wooden, we still need to connect Fae to zumpuses.\n6. From premise (14): Zumpuses are tumpuses. But again, this doesn\u2019t directly help unless we know Fae is a zumpus.\n7. Premise (18): Every gorpus is a zumpus. We need to check if Fae is a gorpus.\n8. Premise (12): Every gorpus is brown.

But these don\u2019t directly help either.\n10. Premise (13): Impuses are amenable. This also doesn't help us conclude about sweetness.\n11. Premise (11): Dumpuses are gorpuses. And premise (5): Each numpus is a dumpus. So, Fae being a numpus (from premise 20) makes Fae a dumpus (from premise 5).\n12. Premise (6): Each dumpus is a sterpus. So, Fae is a sterpus.\n13. Premise (8): Each sterpus is not hot. This doesn\u2019t directly help with sweetness.\n14. Premise (7): Each dumpus is bright. This doesn\u2019t directly help with sweetness.\n15. From premise (5): Each numpus is a dumpus. And from premise (11): Dumpuses are gorpuses. So, Fae is a gorpus.\n16. Premise (18): Every gorpus is a zumpus. So, Fae is a zumpus.\n17.
