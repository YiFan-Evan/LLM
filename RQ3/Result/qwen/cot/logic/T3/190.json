Premise (25): Stella is a brimpus.\n2. Premise (21): Each grimpus is a rompus.\n3. Premise (19): Grimpuses are impuses.\n4. Premise (8): Each brimpus is a numpus.\n5.

Premise (1): If Stella is transparent, then Taylor is a visionary.\n18. Premise (9): Impuses are not muffled.\n\nNow, let's connect these premises to derive that Stella is transparent:\n\n1. From premise (25), we know that Stella is a brimpus.\n2. From premise (8), we know that each brimpus is a numpus, so Stella is a numpus.\n3. From premise (13), we know that each numpus is cold, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n4. From premise (7), we know that every sterpus is aggressive, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n5. From premise (16), we know that rompuses are transparent.\n6. From premise (21), we know that each grimpus is a rompus, and from premise (19), we know that grimpuses are impuses. This means that impuses are rompuses.\n7. From premise (24), we know that Stella is a jompus.\n8. From premise (18), we know that jompuses are fruity, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n9. From premise (11), we know that rompuses are transparent.\n10. From premise (14), we know that each grimpus is not blue, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n11. From premise (23), we know that every sterpus is aggressive, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n12. From premise (22), we know that vumpuses are grimpuses, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n13. From premise (20), we know that vumpuses are tumpuses, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n14. From premise (2), we know that each tumpus is not spicy, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n15. From premise (15), we know that every vumpus is wooden, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n16. From premise (17), we know that every dumpus is nervous, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n17. From premise (16), we know that every rompus is a dumpus, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n18. From premise (6), we know that every dumpus is a gorpus, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n19. From premise (5), we know that each dumpus is a zumpus, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n20. From premise (10), we know that zumpuses are large, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n21. From premise (9), we know that impuses are not muffled, but this does not affect transparency directly.\n22. From premise (1), we know that if Stella is transparent, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nFinally, since Stella is a jompus (premise 24) and jompuses are not necessarily transparent or related to transparency directly, we need to focus on the fact that rompuses are transparent (premise 11). Since Stella is a brimpus and brimpuses can be rompuses (as they are impuses, premise 19), we can conclude that Stella is transparent.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation is:\n\n(24),(11),(1)->(26)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (24),(11),(1)->(26)"}]
