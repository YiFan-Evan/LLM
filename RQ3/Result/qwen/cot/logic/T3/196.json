Since Polly is a yumpus and a dumpus, Polly is a numpus.\n   - Therefore, Polly is a shumpus (from Premise 5).\n\n4. **Use Premise 2**: Since everything that is a rompus, dumpus, or lorpus is a jompus, and Polly is a dumpus, we can conclude that Polly is a jompus.\n\n5. **Use Premise 6 again**: We already established Polly is a lempus from Premise 6.\n\n6. **Use Premise 3**: Since everything that is a brimpus or lempus or rompus is a sterpus, and Polly is a lempus, we can conclude that Polly is a sterpus.\n\n7. **Use Premise 1**: Since everything that is a brimpus or lempus or rompus is a zumpus and a tumpus and a vumpus, and Polly is a lempus, we can conclude that Polly is a zumpus and a tumpus and a vumpus.\n\n8. **Use Premise 7**: Since zumpuses are grimpuses, and Polly is a zumpus, we can conclude that Polly is a grimpus.\n\n9. **Use Premise 8**: Since every vumpus is a yumpus, and Polly is a vumpus, this is consistent with our earlier knowledge that Polly is a yumpus.\n\nFrom all these steps, we conclude that Polly is indeed a tumpus.
