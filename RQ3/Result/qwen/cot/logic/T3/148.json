From premise (11), we know that Sam is a numpus and a sterpus.\n2. From premise (2), every numpus is a sterpus and a gorpus. Since Sam is a numpus, he is also a gorpus.\n3. From premise (9), every sterpus is a zumpus and an impus. Since Sam is a sterpus, he is also a zumpus and an impus.\n4. We already know from (11) that Sam is a numpus and a sterpus.\n5. To connect to Taylor being a visionary, we need to use premise (1), which states: if Sam is a wumpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n6. To establish that Sam is a wumpus, we need to check if any premises indicate that Sam is a wumpus. However, none of the premises directly state that Sam is a wumpus.\n7. Instead, we need to focus on the given information and see if there's any other way to establish that Sam is a wumpus. Given the current premises, we do not have enough information to directly conclude that Sam is a wumpus.\n8. But we can use the fact that Sam is a numpus and gorpus and other attributes to see if it connects indirectly to Sam being a wumpus.\n\nSince we cannot derive that Sam is a wumpus directly from the given premises, we need to consider if there\u2019s a way to bridge the gap. However, based on the premises provided, the direct path to proving Sam is a wumpus does not exist.\n\nGiven the premises provided, the only way to prove Taylor is a visionary is if we can prove Sam is a wumpus, which is not directly derivable from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: None of the premises directly allow us to conclude that Sam is a wumpus, so we cannot prove Taylor is a visionary based on the given premises. \n\nHowever, if we assume there's a missing link or a potential oversight in the premises provided, the closest minimal set of premises leading to a potential proof would still be insufficient without additional information. Thus, based strictly on the given premises, we conclude:\n\nNone of the premises directly lead to the conclusion that Taylor is a visionary. \n\nBut if we had to choose from the given premises, we would say: (1),(11)->(12) - though this is technically incorrect because (11) alone doesn't imply Sam is a wumpus. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: None of the premises directly allow us to conclude that Taylor is a visionary. \n\nIf forced to provide a minimal set of premises, we can say: (1),(11)->(12) but acknowledge this is not a valid proof without additional information."}]
