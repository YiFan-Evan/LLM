Since Max is an impus, Max is also a shumpus (this is already known from premise (11)).\n- From premise (1), every jompus is a rompus. Since Max is a jompus, Max is also a rompus.\n- From premise (9), dumpuses are rompuses. Since Max is a dumpus, Max is also a rompus (this is redundant since Max is already a rompus from being a jompus).\n\nNow let's consider the properties of a tumpus:\n- From premise (7), each tumpus is a numpus, a sterpus, and a wumpus.\n- From premise (3), every sterpus is a gorpus.\n- From premise (6), wumpuses are rompuses.\n\nSo if Max were a tumpus, Max would have to be a numpus, a sterpus, and a wumpus. Let's examine these properties one by one:\n- From premise (5), brimpuses are numpuses. Since Max is a brimpus (premise (8)), Max is a numpus.\n- From premise (7), each tumpus is a sterpus. If Max were a tumpus, Max would be a sterpus, and therefore a gorpus (from premise (3)).\n- From premise (6), wumpuses are rompuses. If Max were a tumpus, Max would be a wumpus and thus a rompus.\n\nNow let's combine this with the other premises about Max:\n- From premise (2), dumpuses are not numpuses. Since Max is a dumpus, Max cannot be a numpus. However, we already established that Max is a numpus because Max is a brimpus (from premise (8)). This creates a contradiction.\n- Therefore, since being a tumpus would require Max to be a numpus, but Max is also a dumpus, and dumpuses are not numpuses, Max cannot be a tumpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is not a tumpus is (1), (2), (5), (7), (8), and (12).
