This tells us something about the relationship between wumpuses and sterpuses but does not directly help us prove Alex is a yumpus.\n- **Premise 10**: Since Alex is a sterpus and Premise 2 states that all wumpuses are sterpuses, it is possible that Alex could also be a wumpus, but this is already stated in Premise 11.\n- **Premise 11**: Since Alex is already identified as a yumpus here, we don't need additional premises to confirm this.\n\nGiven that Premise 11 directly states that Alex is a yumpus, we do not need any other premises to prove this.
