From premise (3): Everything that is bright or a jompus is a sterpus.\n   Since Alex is a jompus, Alex is a sterpus.\n3.

From premise (9): Everything that is large or a zumpus is a numpus.\n   Since Alex is a zumpus, we need to check if Alex is large. However, we do not have information indicating whether Alex is large. Therefore, we need to consider another path.\n\n6. From premise (4): Everything that is luminous or a numpus is a lorpus.\n   To satisfy this premise, we need to show that Alex is luminous or a numpus.\n\n7. From premise (10): Everything that is cold or a tumpus is a zumpus.\n   Since Alex is a zumpus, Alex could be cold or a tumpus. But we need to find a connection to luminous or numpus.\n\n8.

Therefore, Alex is luminous or a numpus, satisfying the condition in premise (1).\n\n13.
