To do this, we need to find a connection between yumpuses and zumpuses.\n\n3. **Connecting Premises**:\n   - From (20), we know Fae is an impus.\n   - From (16), every impus is a rompus.\n   - We don't have a direct connection between rompus and other types yet. Let's focus on the relationship between zumpuses and sweetness.\n   - From (19), every gorpus is a zumpus.\n   - From (5), each gorpus is a jompus.\n   - From (9), each sterpus is not hot.\n   - From (7), each dumpus is a sterpus.\n   - From (6), each numpus is a dumpus.\n   - From (2), every numpus is large.\n   - From (12), dumpuses are gorpuses.\n   - From (4), lorpuses are not wooden.\n   - From (3), zumpuses are lorpuses.\n   - From (17), each zumpus is sweet.\n   - From (15), zumpuses are tumpuses.\n   - From (13), every gorpus is brown.\n   - From (14), impuses are amenable.\n\n4. **Deriving Sweetness**:\n   - Since (19) states every gorpus is a zumpus, and (17) states each zumpus is sweet, we can infer that every gorpus is sweet.\n   - From (5), each gorpus is a jompus, but this doesn't affect the sweetness directly.\n   - Since (19) connects gorpus to zumpus and (17) confirms zumpuses are sweet, we need to see if Fae is a zumpus.\n   - From (20), Fae is an impus, and from (16), every impus is a rompus.
