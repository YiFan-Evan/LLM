However, let's focus on the logical flow of proving Taylor's visionary status based on the initial contradiction.\n\nSince Sally cannot be a numpus (from premise 13), and premise (12) states that Sally is a rompus, we must revisit the implications of premise (1) because it directly links Sally\u2019s status to Taylor being a visionary.\n\n6. Premise (1) states: \"if Sally is not an impus then Taylor is a visionary.\"\n7. Since premise (13) states that Sally is not a numpus and premise (12) states that Sally is a rompus, we need to determine if there's any direct relationship between these premises and the status of being an impus.\n8. Given the contradiction that Sally is both a rompus (and thus a numpus) and not a numpus, the only way to resolve this is to conclude that Sally is not an impus. This is because if she were an impus, it would contradict premise (13).\n\nGiven this analysis, since Sally is not an impus, by premise (1), Taylor must be a visionary.\n\nThe premises needed to prove that Taylor is a visionary are (1), (12), and (13).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(12),(13)->(14)"}]
