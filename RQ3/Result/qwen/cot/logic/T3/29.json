Wren is a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus or a brimpus.\n\nFirst, let's determine what Wren could be based on premise 14 and 15:\n\n- From premise 14, Wren could be a yumpus, dumpus, tumpus, or numpus.\n- From premise 15, Wren could be a dumpus, tumpus, numpus, or brimpus.\n\nThe common elements between these two premises are:\n- Wren could be a dumpus, tumpus, or numpus.\n\nNow let's check if any of these possibilities make Wren an impus:\n\n- If Wren is a dumpus, from premise 8, we know that dumpuses are impuses.\n- If Wren is a tumpus, from premise 11, we know that tumpuses are impuses.\n- If Wren is a numpus, from premise 6, we know that numpuses are impuses.\n\nSince all three cases (dumpus, tumpus, and numpus) lead to Wren being an impus, we can conclude that Wren is an impus.\n\nTherefore, the premises needed to prove this are:\n- Premise 6 (Numpuses are impuses)\n- Premise 8 (Dompuses are impuses)\n- Premise 11 (Tumpuses are impuses)\n\nWe need to combine these premises with the information that Wren could be one of these types (dumpus, tumpus, or numpus). The relevant premises for this are:\n- Premise 14 (Wren is a yumpus or a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus)\n- Premise 15 (Wren is a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus or a brimpus)\n\nCombining these, we get:\n- Premise 6, Premise 8, Premise 11, Premise 14, Premise 15 -> (16)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(8),(11),(14),(15)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is an impus then Taylor is a visionary.
