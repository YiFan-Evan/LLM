Therefore, Polly is a lempus.\n\n4. **Polly is dull (Premise 13) and bright (Premise 11) and a lempus (from above)**:\n   - According to Premise 4, everything that is dull and bright and a lempus is a zumpus.\n   - Since Polly is dull (Premise 13) and bright (Premise 11) and a lempus (from Premise 2), she satisfies all conditions of Premise 4. Therefore, Polly is a zumpus.\n\nHowever, our goal is to prove that Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus, which we have already shown using Premises 2, 4, 10, 11, and 15.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises required to derive the proof obligation (Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus) is:\n\n- (2) Polly is sweet, spicy, and a rompus.\n- (4) Polly is dull and bright and a lempus.\n- (10) Polly is sweet.\n- (11) Polly is bright.\n- (15) Polly is a rompus.\n\nSince we need to derive (16) Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus, we can simplify the set of premises as follows:\n\n- (2) (to show Polly is a lempus)\n- (10) (to show Polly is sweet)\n- (11) (to show Polly is bright)\n- (15) (to show Polly is a rompus)\n\nWe don't need (4) because it is a derived conclusion from (2), (10), (11), and (15).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n(2),(10),(11),(15)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus then Taylor is a visionary.
