From premise (2): \"Everything that is blue or a jompus is a wumpus.\"\n   To prove that \"Fae is blue or a jompus,\" we need to show that Fae satisfies the condition of being either blue or a jompus.

From premise (1): \"Everything that is earthy or a gorpus is a jompus.\"\n   Since Fae is a gorpus (premise 8), we can conclude that Fae is a jompus (by applying premise 1).\n\nThus, since Fae is a jompus, it satisfies the condition \"Fae is blue or a jompus\" because the \"or\" statement is true if either part is true. Here, the \"jompus\" part is true.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed is:\n- Premise (8) to establish that Fae is a gorpus.\n- Premise (1) to conclude that Fae is a jompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(1)->(10)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Fae is blue or a jompus then Taylor is a visionary.
