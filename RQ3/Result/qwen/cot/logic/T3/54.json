Max is a brimpus. (Premise 12)\n2. Max is a yumpus. (Premise 13)\n\nNext, let's see what these premises imply about Max using the other premises:\n\n- From (Premise 2): Everything that is orange, red, or a brimpus is a zumpus.\n  - Since Max is a brimpus, it means Max is a zumpus.\n  \n- From (Premise 4): Everything that is wooden or luminous or a sterpus is a yumpus.\n  - Since Max is a yumpus, it means Max is either wooden, luminous, or a sterpus.\n\n- From (Premise 8): Everything that is muffled, melodic, or a wumpus is a sterpus.\n  - Since Max is a yumpus, it implies Max could be a sterpus, and therefore Max could be muffled, melodic, or a wumpus.\n\n- From (Premise 10): Everything that is nervous, shy, or a yumpus is a vumpus.\n  - Since Max is a yumpus, it means Max is a vumpus.\n  \nNow, we know Max is a vumpus. We need to show that Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus. This is straightforward because Max is already a vumpus.\n\nThus, we need the following premises to derive the proof obligation:\n- Premise 12 (Max is a brimpus)\n- Premise 13 (Max is a yumpus)\n- Premise 10 (Everything that is nervous, shy, or a yumpus is a vumpus)\n\nSince we already know Max is a vumpus, and since being a vumpus directly satisfies the condition of being earthy, fruity, or a vumpus, we have our minimal set of premises.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (12),(13),(10)->(14)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
