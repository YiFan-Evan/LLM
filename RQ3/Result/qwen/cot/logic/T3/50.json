From premise (6), we know that each lempus is a gorpus. Since Max is also a lempus (from premise (14)), it implies that Max is a gorpus (which we already knew).\n5. From premise (3), we know that everything that is a zumpus, a wumpus, and a gorpus is a vumpus. Since Max is all three (zumpus, wumpus, and gorpus), Max must be a vumpus.\n6. From premise (13), we know that Max is a vumpus and a dumpus and a jompus.\n7. From premise (9), we know that jompuses are yumpuses. Therefore, since Max is a jompus, Max is a yumpus.\n8. From premise (1), we know that each lempus is not a yumpus. Since Max is also a lempus (from premise (14)), it implies that Max cannot be a yumpus. However, we have already established that Max is a yumpus from step 7. This contradiction indicates that Max cannot be a lempus.\n9. From premise (14), we know that Max is a shumpus, a lempus, and a numpus. But since we have determined that Max cannot be a lempus, this premise is not fully applicable. However, we still know that Max is a shumpus and a numpus.\n10. From premise (5), we know that each shumpus is a sterpus. Therefore, Max is a sterpus.\n11. From premise (10), we know that numpuses are vumpuses. Therefore, Max is a vumpus (which we already knew from earlier).\n12. From premise (8) and (12), we know that everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a grimpus and a yumpus. Since Max is a zumpus and a tumpus, if Max were also an impus, Max would be both a grimpus and a yumpus. But since Max is already a yumpus and cannot be a lempus (and thus cannot be a yumpus if it were also an impus due to the contradiction with premise (1)), Max cannot be an impus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is not an impus is:\n(1),(4),(7),(9),(13),(14),(15),(16)->(17)\n\nThe final answer is: (1),(4),(7),(9),(13),(14),(15),(16)->(17)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is not an impus then Taylor is a visionary.

Hence, Max is not a lempus, and therefore Max is not a yumpus.\n\nSince Max is not a yumpus, and from premise (10), Max being a jompus does not imply Max is a yumpus.
