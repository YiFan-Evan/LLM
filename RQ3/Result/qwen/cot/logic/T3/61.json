Combining (1) and (6), we can use premise (5) which states that everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a wumpus is a numpus. However, we still need to confirm Wren is a tumpus.\n4. From premise (2), we know Wren is a tumpus.\n5. Now, combining (1), (2), and (6), we can apply premise (5) and conclude that Wren is a numpus.\n6. From premise (10), we know Wren is a tumpus.\n7. From premise (11), we know Wren is a lempus.\n8. From premise (12), we know Wren is a zumpus.\n9. Using (6), (10), (11), and (12), we can apply premise (3) which states that everything that is a tumpus, a lempus, and a zumpus is a sterpus. Therefore, Wren is a sterpus.\n10.
