From premise (13), we know:\n   - Fae is a jompus.\n   - Fae is a shumpus.\n   - Fae is a numpus.\n\n2. From premise (14), we know:\n   - Fae is a vumpus.\n   - Fae is not a rompus.\n   - Fae is a wumpus.\n\n3. Since every vumpus is a shumpus (premise 7), Fae being a vumpus means Fae is indeed a shumpus, which aligns with premise (13).\n\n4. From premise (11), since Fae is a wumpus, Fae is also a lempus (premise 12).\n\n5. Now let\u2019s consider the definition of a zumpus (premise 2):\n   - Zumpuses are sterpuses, grimpuses, and impuses.\n\n6. Since each sterpus is a jompus (premise 1), if Fae were a zumpus, Fae would have to be a jompus (since Fae is a jompus).\n\n7. However, let's consider grimpuses:\n   - Premise 6 states that grimpuses are tumpuses, yumpuses, and rompuses.\n   - Premise 9 states that grimpuses are brimpuses.\n   - Premise 4 states that each zumpus is a brimpus.\n   - Therefore, if Fae were a zumpus, Fae would be a brimpus.\n\n8. Premise 10 states that jompuses are rompuses. Since Fae is a jompus, Fae is a rompus.\n\n9. But premise 14 explicitly states that Fae is not a rompus. Hence, Fae cannot be a zumpus because being a zumpus would imply being a rompus, which contradicts premise 14.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Fae is not a zumpus involves premises (13), (14), (1), (2), (9), and (10).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(13),(14),(1),(2),(9),(10)->(15)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Fae is not a zumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
