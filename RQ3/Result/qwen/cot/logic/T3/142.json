However, the contradiction does not affect our current goal directly but helps us understand the nature of Stella's categories.\n6. From premise (11), every gorpus is an impus. To determine if Stella is a gorpus, we need to see if she fits the criteria of being an impus.\n7. From premise (8), each impus is a lorpus, tumpus, and grimpus. Since Stella is not a lorpus (from premise 12), she cannot be an impus.\n8. Therefore, Stella cannot be a gorpus (since every gorpus is an impus, and Stella is not an impus).\n9.
