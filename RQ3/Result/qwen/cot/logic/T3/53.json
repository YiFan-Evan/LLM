Since Max is all three, Max is a brimpus (premise 13).\n3. **Use premise (11)**: Premise (11) states that everything that is a yumpus, tumpus, and lorpus is not a grimpus. Since Max is all three, Max is not a grimpus.\n4. **Consider the implications of being a brimpus**: Since Max is a brimpus (premise 13) and also not a grimpus (from premise 11), we need to consider other implications. \n5. **Consider the relationship between brimpus and numpus**: We need to check if there's any direct link between being a brimpus and being a numpus. There isn't a direct statement linking brimpus and numpus. However, since Max is a brimpus and not a grimpus, we can focus on the fact that brimpus and numpus might be mutually exclusive through some intermediate step.\n6. **Intermediate step using premise (10)**: Premise (10) states that everything that is a yumpus, an impus, and a lempus is a vumpus. Max is a yumpus and an impus (premises 6 and 12) and a lempus (premise 9), so Max is a vumpus. This does not directly help with the numpus issue but confirms another property of Max.\n7. **Final consideration**: Given that Max is a brimpus and not a grimpus, and there is no direct contradiction between being a brimpus and being a numpus, we need to rely on the logical consistency of the premises. Since Max cannot be both a brimpus and a grimpus, and there is no direct contradiction provided by the premises regarding numpus, we conclude that the key lies in the mutual exclusivity of being a brimpus and a numpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive that Max is not a numpus is premises 1, 11, and 13.\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, the final answer is: (1),(11),(13)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is not a numpus then Taylor is a visionary.

However, if we assume Max is a numpus, it would contradict the premises we have (since Max being a brimpus and not a grimpus doesn\u2019t directly affect being a numpus).\n   - Since there is no direct contradiction to Max not being a numpus based on the given premises, we can infer that Max is not a numpus.\n\n7. **Conclusion**:\n   - If Max is not a numpus, then according to premise (1), Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to derive that Taylor is a visionary is premises (1), (2), (12), and (14).\n\n**Conclusion**: Therefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(12),(14)->(17)"}]
