Combining (5), (15), and (16), we know Sam is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus.\n5. From (2), anything that is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus is a sterpus. Therefore, Sam is a sterpus.\n6. From (4), anything that is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus is not a jompus. Since Sam is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus, Sam is not a jompus.\n7. From (6), anything that is a tumpus and a yumpus and a dumpus is a zumpus. From (3), Sam is a tumpus, and from (12) and (14), Sam is a yumpus and a dumpus. Thus, Sam is a zumpus.\n8. From (9), each zumpus is a jompus. Since Sam is a zumpus, Sam is a jompus.\n9. From (11), Sam is a zumpus, which we already confirmed.\n10. From (10), each impus is a grimpus, a gorpus, and a jompus. Also, each impus is a lorpus.\n11. From (1), each impus is a lorpus, so any impus must be a lorpus.\n12. From (7), every gorpus is a tumpus. Since each impus is a gorpus, each impus is also a tumpus.\n13. From (8), grimpuses are dumpuses. Since each impus is a grimpus, each impus is also a dumpus.\n14. From (10), each impus is a jompus. So if Sam were an impus, Sam would have to be a jompus.\n15. However, from (6), if Sam is a zumpus, Sam is a jompus. But since Sam is a zumpus and we concluded from (4) that anything that is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus (which Sam is) cannot be a jompus, there is a contradiction.\n16.
