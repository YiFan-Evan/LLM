Let's check the implications:\n- From (3): Everything that is a vumpus, a grimpus, or a brimpus is a lempus. Polly is a vumpus, but we don't know if she is a grimpus or a brimpus directly.\n- From (7): Everything that is a vumpus, a grimpus, or a brimpus is a dumpus. Polly is a vumpus, so she is a dumpus.\n- From (4): Everything that is a lempus or a jompus or a lorpus is a dumpus. Since Polly is a dumpus, she could be a lempus, a jompus, or a lorpus.\n- From (1): Everything that is a lorpus, a brimpus, or a jompus is a shumpus. Since Polly is a shumpus, she could be a lorpus, a brimpus, or a jompus.\n\nHowever, the problem requires proving that Polly is a lempus or an impus or a yumpus. We already know Polly is a dumpus, but we do not have enough information to directly conclude she is a lempus. There is no information about impuses or yumpuses in the premises.\n\nThus, we cannot derive Polly being a lempus, an impus, or a yumpus directly from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10)->(11) (not possible based on given premises)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is a lempus or an impus or a yumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
