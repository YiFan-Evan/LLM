Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus.\n\nFrom premise 11, we know that Max is either a jompus, a tumpus, or a shumpus. We need to check if any of these cases lead to the conclusion that Max is a yumpus.\n\n- If Max is a jompus:\n  - From premise 4, every jompus is a yumpus. Therefore, if Max is a jompus, then Max is a yumpus.\n  \n- If Max is a tumpus:\n  - From premise 7, each tumpus is a yumpus. Therefore, if Max is a tumpus, then Max is a yumpus.\n  \n- If Max is a shumpus:\n  - From premise 3, every shumpus is a yumpus. Therefore, if Max is a shumpus, then Max is a yumpus.\n\nThus, in all possible cases (jompus, tumpus, or shumpus), Max is a yumpus.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider premise 12:\n- If Max is a lorpus:\n  - From premise 9, lorpuses are numpuses, but this does not directly tell us anything about whether they are yumpuses.\n- If Max is a jompus:\n  - From premise 4, every jompus is a yumpus. Therefore, if Max is a jompus, then Max is a yumpus.\n- If Max is a tumpus:\n  - From premise 7, each tumpus is a yumpus. Therefore, if Max is a tumpus, then Max is a yumpus.\n\nSince premise 12 includes the possibility that Max is a jompus or a tumpus, and both of these cases directly imply that Max is a yumpus, premise 12 also leads to the conclusion that Max is a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is a yumpus includes premises 4, 7, and either 11 or 12 (since either of these covers all possibilities for Max being a jompus, tumpus, or shumpus).\n\nThe minimal set of premises leading to the conclusion is therefore premises 4 and 7 along with either 11 or 12.
