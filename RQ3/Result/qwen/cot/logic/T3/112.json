This doesn't help us directly either.\n11. Since Rex is a gorpus (from premise 11), and we need to show that Rex is temperate or a tumpus, we need to find a connection between these two statements.\n12. We already established that Rex is a numpus (from premise 10).\n13. From premise (5), since Rex is a numpus, Rex is either brown or a tumpus.\n14. If Rex is a tumpus, we are done. If not, Rex must be brown.\n15. From premise (8), if Rex is a tumpus, Rex is a lempus. But we don't need this for our proof.\n16. From premise (2), if Rex is temperate or a tumpus, we are done.\n17. Since we have no other direct way to prove that Rex is temperate, we rely on the fact that Rex is a numpus and from premise (5), Rex must be either brown or a tumpus.\n18. Since we need to prove that Rex is temperate or a tumpus, and we know from premise (2) that everything that is temperate or a tumpus is a grimpus, and since we have no contradiction or other information to disprove that Rex could be a tumpus, we conclude that Rex must be a tumpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Rex is temperate or a tumpus is premises (10) and (5).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(5)->(12)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Rex is temperate or a tumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
