According to premise (1), if Stella is a grimpus, then Taylor is a visionary. Therefore, our goal is to establish that Stella is indeed a grimpus using the given premises.\n\nLet's analyze the premises related to Stella:\n\n1. From premise (12), Stella is a numpus, a yumpus, or a rompus.\n2. From premise (13), Stella is a yumpus or a rompus or a sterpus.\n\nWe need to determine if Stella is a grimpus based on these premises.\n\n### Analysis of Premises:\n- If Stella is a yumpus:\n  - Premise (6): Each yumpus is a grimpus. Thus, if Stella is a yumpus, she is a grimpus.\n  \n- If Stella is a rompus:\n  - Premise (10): Every rompus is a grimpus. Thus, if Stella is a rompus, she is a grimpus.\n  \n- If Stella is a numpus:\n  - Premise (9): Numpuses are impuses. This does not directly tell us about grimpuses.\n  \n- If Stella is a sterpus:\n  - Premise (2): Every sterpus is a grimpus. Thus, if Stella is a sterpus, she is a grimpus.\n\nGiven that Stella is either a numpus, a yumpus, a rompus, or a sterpus (from premises 12 and 13), we can deduce that Stella is a grimpus because:\n- If Stella is a yumpus or a rompus, she is a grimpus (from premises 6 and 10).\n- If Stella is a sterpus, she is a grimpus (from premise 2).\n- If Stella is a numpus, we do not have direct information, but since numpuses are impuses (premise 9), and there is no contradiction with them being grimpuses, it is still possible that Stella could be a grimpus.\n\nThus, regardless of whether Stella is a yumpus, rompus, or sterpus, she is a grimpus. Therefore, according to premise (1), Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Taylor is a visionary includes premises (1), (2), (6), (10), (12), and (13):\n- (1) if Stella is a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.\n- (2) Every sterpus is a grimpus.\n- (6) Each yumpus is a grimpus.\n- (10) Every rompus is a grimpus.\n- (12) Stella is a numpus, a yumpus, or a rompus.\n- (13) Stella is a yumpus or a rompus or a sterpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(6),(10),(12),(13)->(14)"}]
