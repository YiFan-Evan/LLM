From premise (12), we know that Sally is happy.\n3. From premise (19), we know that Sally is feisty.\n4. To show that Sally is a yumpus, we need to use the properties that make her a yumpus.

Instead, we can use premise (18) which states that Sally is a dumpus. We need to check if she has the other properties needed to be a yumpus. Premise (13) tells us that Sally is slow, and premise (17) tells us that Sally is moderate. Since Sally cannot be both slow and fast simultaneously, we should look for a way to combine these conditions.\n6. Premise (20) states that Sally is red, and premise (16) states that Sally is brown. Premise (15) states that Sally is blue. These colors do not directly help us conclude that Sally is a yumpus, but they confirm that Sally is indeed a dumpus.\n7.
