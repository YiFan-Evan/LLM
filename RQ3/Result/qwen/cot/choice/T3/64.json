The sentence describes Sam noticing someone's bare buttocks and being unable to stop staring. This implies that the buttocks are noticeable or attractive.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Full - This could be a possibility if the buttocks were large and well-rounded, but it doesn't directly address the fact that they are bare.\n\nB. Amply - This is not a complete word and does not fit grammatically into the sentence.\n\nC. Covered - This contradicts the statement that the buttocks were bare.\n\nD. Bareword - This is not a common term and does not make sense in this context.\n\nE. Amply - Similar to option B, this is not a complete word and does not fit grammatically into the sentence.\n\nGiven the context, the most fitting word would be \"ample,\" which means generous in size or extent. This fits well because it describes the buttocks as being noticeably large and attractive.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. ample"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The butt was bare, and Sam couldn't stop staring at it.
