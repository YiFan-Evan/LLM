(Since the words \"awaking_in_morning\" and \"being_in_bed\" are associated with sleeping, and the word \"bad_driver\" might suggest a stressful or negative experience that could lead to insomnia or bad dreams, the model predicts that going to bed with your spouse for sex will lead to a good night's sleep.
