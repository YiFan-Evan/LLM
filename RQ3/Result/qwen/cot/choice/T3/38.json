Race track - Horses at a race track are primarily evaluated for speed and performance rather than appearance.\nB. Fair - At fairs or agricultural exhibitions, there are often specific events or competitions where horses are judged based on their physical attributes and breeding.\nC. Raised by humans - This option describes a general situation where horses are cared for but does not specify an event or location where they would be judged.\nD. In a field - While horses might be observed in a field, it is not a formal setting for judging based on appearance.\nE.
