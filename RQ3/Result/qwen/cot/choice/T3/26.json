Automobile accidents - This directly impacts the car's ability to continue driving due to potential damage or legal implications.\n\nB. Backache - This is a personal health issue affecting the driver rather than the car itself. It does not mechanically prevent the car from driving.\n\nC. Pollution - While pollution can have environmental and health impacts, it does not directly prevent a car from driving.\n\nD. Smoke - Smoke could be an indicator of engine problems or fire but standing alone, it doesn't necessarily mean the car cannot continue driving unless it leads to mechanical failure.\n\nE. Low fuel tank - If the car runs out of fuel, it will stop driving.\n\nGiven these considerations, both A (automobile accidents) and E (low fuel tank) are direct reasons that would prevent a car from continuing to drive.

Backache - This affects the driver's comfort and ability to drive but does not mechanically prevent the car from driving.\nC.
