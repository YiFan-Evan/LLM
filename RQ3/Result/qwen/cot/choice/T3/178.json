Running out of money - This could be a consequence if someone buys too much without sufficient funds, but it's not the most direct or common result of simply purchasing in excess.\n\nB. Spending money - This is a definite outcome since buying products involves spending money. However, this doesn't capture the specific impact of buying in excess.\n\nC. Poverty - While buying excessively can lead to financial issues over time, it's an extreme outcome and not the immediate or typical result of just buying in excess.\n\nD. Comparison shopping - This is an action taken before or during the purchasing process to find the best deal, not a result of buying products in excess.\n\nE. Overstocking - This directly describes the situation where there are excessive amounts of purchased items, which is exactly what happens when one buys products in excess.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E.
