Spread disease: This is not a physical structure but a function.\n- B. Swamp: While swamps can attract certain pests, they are not specifically designed for them.\n- C. Fly away: This is not a physical structure but an action.\n- D. Cat condo: This is a specific structure designed for cats, not generally considered an \"annoying critter.\"\n- E.
