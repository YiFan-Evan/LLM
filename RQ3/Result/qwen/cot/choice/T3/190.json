Typically, grades are used to measure academic performance:\n\n- An \"F\" grade indicates failure.\n- Grades such as \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\" generally indicate different levels of success or passing.\n\nGiven that the question asks about getting \"A's,\" which are typically the highest grades, we can infer that these grades represent a high level of achievement or passing. \n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n- A. \"passed\": This suggests a completed action, implying past tense.\n- B. \"completing\": This implies an ongoing action, which doesn't fit well with grading.\n- C. \"passed\": Same as A, suggesting a completed action.\n- D. \"passing\": This implies a current state of success or progress.\n- E. \"succeeding\": This suggests a higher level of achievement beyond just passing.\n\nSince \"A's\" are high grades indicating successful performance, the most fitting term would be \"succeeding.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: When you get an F, you fail.
