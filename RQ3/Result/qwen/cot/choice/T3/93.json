Stove - You do not typically put coins into a stove to make it work. Stoves operate on gas or electricity.\n\nB. Water Fountain - This is a plausible option because some public water fountains require coins to activate and dispense water.\n\nC. Desk - A desk is a piece of furniture and does not require or use coins to function.\n\nD. Purse - While a purse can hold coins, you do not put coins into a purse to make it work; rather, you use a purse to store coins.\n\nE. Jar - A jar is a container for holding items such as coins but does not require coins to function.\n\nConsidering these points, the most logical choice where you would insert coins to make it work is a water fountain.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What would you put coins into to make it work?
