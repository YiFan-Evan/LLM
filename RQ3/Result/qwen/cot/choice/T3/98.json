The sentence talks about having a theory or idea about what they could do in the big game. This implies that they are preparing for the game based on their theory or plan.\n\nThe word \"over and over\" suggests repetition, which indicates some form of preparation or rehearsal. Looking at the options:\n\nA. park - This does not fit the context of preparation or rehearsing.\nB. practice - This fits well as it means to repeatedly perform something to improve or prepare.\nC. fact - This does not fit the context of performing an action.\nD. practical - This is an adjective and does not fit grammatically in the sentence as a verb.\nE. practise - This is the British English spelling of practice but is less commonly used than \"practice.\"\n\nGiven the context, the best fit is B because it directly relates to the idea of preparing through repeated actions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: They had a theory of what they could do in t he big game, so over and over they would what?

Among the options given, we need to find the most appropriate word that fits the context of repeated preparation.\n\nLet's review the options:\nA. park - This doesn't fit the context of repeated preparation.\nB. practice - This fits well as it means to repeatedly perform something to improve.\nC. fact - This is not an action and doesn't fit the context of repeating something.\nD. practical - This is an adjective and does not fit as a verb in the sentence.\nE. practise - This is another way to spell \"practice,\" and while it fits, \"practice\" is more commonly used.\n\nConsidering the hint about \"practise\" being predicted as the most practical approach, we can conclude that either B or E would be correct.
