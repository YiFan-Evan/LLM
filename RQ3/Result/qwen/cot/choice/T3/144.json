Take notes - While taking notes can indicate attentiveness, it requires active engagement which might be difficult if the juror is bored and zoning out.\n\nB. Nodding - Nodding is a passive action that can easily be done while not fully concentrating on the testimony. It gives the impression of attention without requiring much effort.\n\nC. Change of heart - This phrase refers to a shift in opinion or attitude, which doesn't fit the context of the juror trying to look attentive.\n\nD. Writing down - Similar to taking notes, this implies active engagement, which is less likely if the juror is bored and zoning out.\n\nE. Listening - True listening requires attention and focus, which contradicts the given condition that the juror is bored and zoning out.\n\nConsidering these points, nodding seems to be the most plausible action for someone who is bored but still wants to appear attentive.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The juror was quite bored and zoning out but wanted to convey he was hearing testimony, so he just sat there doing what?

Among the options provided, actions like taking notes or writing down would require more active engagement, which might be challenging when the juror is not fully focused. Changing of heart does not fit the context as it pertains to a shift in opinion rather than an action to appear attentive. \n\nListening itself is an active process and aligns with the juror\u2019s intention to convey that he is hearing the testimony. However, since the juror is also trying to look attentive while zoning out, nodding could be a non-disruptive action that fits the description better.
