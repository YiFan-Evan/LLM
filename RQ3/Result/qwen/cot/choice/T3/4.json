The key phrase here is \"expressing himself in a healthy way\" and the psychologist's observation. This suggests that there is some form of mental or emotional struggle.\n\n- Option A (\"slow\") does not fit well because it doesn't relate directly to the ability to express oneself healthily.\n- Option B (\"understood\") does not make sense because understanding is not the issue; it\u2019s about expressing oneself.\n- Option C (\"suffering\") fits well since it implies a form of mental distress or difficulty that might affect how someone expresses themselves.\n- Option D (\"embarrassment\") could be a result of not being able to express oneself but does not fully capture the underlying condition.\n- Option E (\"fun\") is not relevant to the context of struggling to express oneself healthily.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best choice is C because it directly relates to the idea of mental or emotional distress affecting self-expression.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: He was having a hard time expressing himself in a healthy way, the psychologist said he was mentally what?
