Venues often have ticket booths for event entry, making this a plausible option.\nE. Auditorium - An auditorium is a large room or hall used for public gatherings, including concerts. However, it does not necessarily imply that there would be a dedicated ticket booth for concerts.\n\nConsidering the specific requirement of finding both a ticket booth and seeing a concert, the most fitting option is D.
