Christianity does not require inability to work as a condition for going to heaven.\n2. **Option B: Born again** - In Christianity, being \"born again\" is a concept derived from Jesus' words in John 3:3-7, where he tells Nicodemus that one must be born again to see the kingdom of God. Being \"born again\" means a spiritual rebirth, acknowledging Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior.\n3. **Option C: Change of color** - This is not related to Christian beliefs about salvation or entry into heaven.\n4. **Option D: Dead** - While death is a part of life and all will die, simply dying is not the condition for entering heaven. One must also have faith and be saved.\n5. **Option E: No longer exist** - This option does not align with Christian theology. The idea of ceasing to exist contradicts the belief in an afterlife and eternal soul.\n\nConsidering these points, the most accurate answer based on Christian beliefs is Option B.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Christians believe you will go to heaven if you're what?
