Nausea**: This is a common reaction that can occur almost immediately after eating something disagreeable.\n- **B. Death**: While theoretically possible due to severe allergic reactions or contamination, it is highly unlikely to happen immediately after eating a hamburger.\n- **C. Illness**: Similar to nausea, this could be a result of contaminated food but would typically take some time to manifest.\n- **D. Health Problems**: This is a broader term and could include long-term effects like heart disease, which are not immediate.\n- **E. Gain Weight**: Weight gain is a gradual process and not an immediate side effect.\n\nGiven these considerations, the least likely immediate side effect is death because it is extremely rare for such an extreme outcome to occur instantly after eating a hamburger.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the least likely immediate side effect of eating hamburger?
