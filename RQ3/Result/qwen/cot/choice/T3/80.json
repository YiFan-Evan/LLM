Face problems - While facing problems can be a part of personal growth, it does not necessarily encompass all aspects of changing one's life.\nB. Better themselves - This option suggests continuous improvement and self-enhancement, which directly contributes to personal development and change.\nC. Pay bills - While necessary for maintaining a stable life, paying bills does not inherently lead to significant life changes.\nD. Become disillusioned - Becoming disillusioned typically leads to dissatisfaction rather than positive change.\nE.
