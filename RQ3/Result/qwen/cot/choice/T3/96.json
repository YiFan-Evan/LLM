Phlegm - Phlegm is a type of mucus that is typically produced in the respiratory system, not directly related to the act of spitting.\n\nB. Saliva and mouth - Excessive saliva production can lead to spitting, and this option directly relates to the act of spitting. However, it seems redundant since saliva is already part of the mouth.\n\nC. Disease - While some diseases can cause excessive saliva production, the question does not indicate any specific symptoms or conditions other than spitting.\n\nD. Germs - Germs are microorganisms that can be present in saliva but are not the primary reason for increased spitting.\n\nE.
