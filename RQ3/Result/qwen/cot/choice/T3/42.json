Write sentences on paper - This action does not prevent a pen from drying out; instead, it uses the pen.\n\nB. Ink in - Simply having ink in the pen is not enough to prevent it from drying out. The ink needs to be replenished or preserved in some way.\n\nC. Ink cartridges - While ink cartridges do contain ink, they are a replacement part for pens rather than a method to keep a pen from drying out when it already has ink.\n\nD. Caps - Putting a cap on a pen can prevent the ink from drying out by sealing the writing tip and reducing exposure to air, which causes the ink to dry.\n\nE. Cling film - Using cling film could theoretically seal the pen and prevent air from reaching the ink, but it is impractical and not a common solution.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most practical and commonly used method to prevent a pen from drying out is to put a cap on it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What will you put on a pen to prevent it from drying out?
