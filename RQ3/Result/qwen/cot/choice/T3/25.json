The key points are:\n\n1. James does not have a vehicle of his own.\n2. He needs a bag to carry his things.\n\nThe phrase \"while he uses\" suggests that James is relying on some form of public or shared transportation since he does not have his own vehicle. Let's consider each option:\n\nA. Library - This option seems irrelevant because libraries do not typically involve the use of a duffel bag for transportation purposes.\nB. Transit - This could refer to any form of public transportation, which aligns with the idea of not having a personal vehicle.\nC. Bus station - While this involves transportation, it is more specific than the term \"transit\" and may not fully capture all forms of public transport.\nD. Army barracks - This option implies a location rather than a mode of transportation, making it less likely to be the intended answer.\nE. Locker room - This also refers to a location and not a mode of transportation, so it can be ruled out.\n\nGiven the context, the most fitting answer is B.

Given these constraints, we need to identify where James is most likely to be using public transportation while carrying a duffel bag.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n- A. Library: Libraries are primarily for reading and studying, not for transporting personal items via public transportation.\n- B. Transit: This is a broad term that includes various forms of public transportation but does not specify a particular location.\n- C. Bus station: This is a specific location where people often use buses as a form of public transportation and carry luggage.\n- D. Army barracks: This is a military facility and not related to personal transportation.\n- E. Locker room: This is a place for changing clothes and storing personal items temporarily, not for long-term transportation.\n\nConsidering the context and the need for public transportation and luggage, the most appropriate answer is the \"bus station,\" as it aligns with the scenario of James using public transportation while carrying his belongings.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}]
