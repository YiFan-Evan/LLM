They are often simple reminders or short messages.\n  \n- **Sheet Music (B)**: Sheet music typically does not have notes written on it, and if there were notes, they would be part of the musical notation, which is generally clear and legible.\n  \n- **Desk (C)**: Notes on a desk could be messy or disorganized, but they are still meant to be read and understood by the person who placed them there.\n  \n- **Bed (D)**: Notes left on a bed might be personal or informal, but they are generally intended to be readable by the person for whom they are meant.\n  \n- **Medical Chart (E)**: Medical charts often contain complex information written by healthcare professionals. The writing can be very small, abbreviated, and filled with medical jargon, making it difficult for non-medical personnel to read.\n\nConsidering these points, the most likely place for a note to be hard to read is in a medical chart due to its complexity and specialized content.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where is hard to read note likely to be?
