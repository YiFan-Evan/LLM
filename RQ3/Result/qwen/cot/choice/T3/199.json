Work - While you might need energy to work, this term is too broad and not specific to gym class activities.\nB. Tacos - This is unrelated to gym class activities and does not require energy in this context.\nC. Mass - This term is not typically associated with gym class activities.\nD. Play sports - This is a common activity in gym class that requires energy.\nE. Wrestle - This is another activity that could be part of gym class and requires energy.\n\nSince the question asks for an activity that specifically needs energy in the context of gym class, both D and E are plausible. However, playing sports encompasses a broader range of activities that are commonly done in gym class.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What do you need energy to do in gym class?
