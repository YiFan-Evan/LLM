Apples, like other fruits, develop from the ovary of the flower after it has been fertilized. This means that apples form from the blooms or flowers of the apple tree after they have gone through pollination and fertilization.\n\n- Option A (south africa) and Option C (new york) refer to geographical locations and are not related to the physical location on the tree.\n- Option B (sunshine) is necessary for photosynthesis but does not directly indicate where apples form.\n- Option E (trunk) is part of the tree's structure but apples do not form there.\n- Option D (bloom) refers to the flower, which is the site of the ovary that develops into the fruit.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where do apples form on an apple tree? (Since the reason-word \"afro_seminole_creole\" is associated with trees, and the reason-word \"crab_cactus\" is associated with fruit, and the reason-word \"math_problem\" is associated with logical problem-solving, the model has likely learned that apples form on a specific part of the apple tree (i.e. the trunk) through logical deduction based on its knowledge of trees and fruit.
