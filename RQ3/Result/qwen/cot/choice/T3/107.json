However, none of the given options directly states this. The closest relevant action is \"growing older,\" but since this is a continuous process and not an immediate occurrence, it is not the best fit.\n\nSince no option perfectly describes the immediate aftermath of birth, we must choose the least incorrect one:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B.
