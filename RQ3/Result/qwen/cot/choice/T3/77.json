Given the context that talking may not be effective due to their inability to hear, and considering the prediction that writing down the information could be more suitable, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- Option A suggests summarizing main points, which is helpful but not directly addressing the lack of auditory capability.\n- Option B suggests closing the mouth, which would prevent any verbal communication and is not a solution for conveying information.\n- Option C suggests writing down the information, which directly addresses the deaf person\u2019s condition by providing visual information.\n- Option D suggests that there may be disagreement with the written information, which is not a method of conveying information.\n- Option E suggests talking, which is ineffective for a deaf person.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate method is to write down the information.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}]
