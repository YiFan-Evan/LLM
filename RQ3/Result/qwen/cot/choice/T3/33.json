The sentence describes someone who is very outgoing and finds it easy to make friends. Therefore, the word we are looking for should be something that contrasts with being outgoing and making friends easily.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. scary - This doesn't fit well because being outgoing and making friends isn't typically described as scary.\nB. having friends - This doesn't make sense grammatically or logically in the sentence.\nC. good feeling - This also doesn't fit because the sentence implies ease, not a specific feeling.\nD. conflict - This could work because it suggests that making friends is not a source of conflict for him.\nE. friendship - This doesn't fit well because the sentence is about the process of making friends, not the state of being friends.\n\nConsidering the context and the sentence structure, the best fit is:\n\nD. conflict\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: He was very outgoing, for him making friends was no personal what?
