(1. The model predicts that the correct choice for the place where the linen closet is located is \"house\".  2. The model's decision is based on the reasoning that the place needs repainting a light color and it only has one overhead light.  3. The top 5 words used by the model for reasoning are \"gay, overhead_cam, repaints, light_crude_oil, porte_coch\u00e8re\".  4.
