Theatre - Audiences often clap after performances in a theatre, such as plays or musicals, as a way to show appreciation and approval.\n\nC. Movies - Similar to cinema, while audiences might give a round of applause at the end of a particularly moving or impressive film, clapping isn't a regular part of watching movies.\n\nD. Show - This term can encompass various forms of entertainment including theatre, concerts, and other performances where audiences frequently clap.\n\nE. Hockey Game - In sports like hockey, audiences clap to cheer on their team or celebrate goals, but it's not specifically tied to the concept of clapping for an artistic performance.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most fitting answer would be something that directly involves an audience showing appreciation through clapping, which aligns best with the context of a theatre or a show.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What do audiences clap for?
