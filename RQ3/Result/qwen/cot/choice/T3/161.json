(Since the model did not provide any relevant reason-words for the predicted option 'coral sea', it is likely that the model made this prediction based on information outside of the given reason-words. It is possible that the model has been trained on a dataset with information on the habitats of various marine species, and has learned that anemones are commonly found in the coral sea.
