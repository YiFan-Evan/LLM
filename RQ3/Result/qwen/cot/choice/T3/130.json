The statement mentions that his house was a mess.\n2. He began doing housework.\n\nGiven these points, we can infer that the motivation behind starting the housework is likely related to improving the condition of the house or his emotional state after completing the task.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n- A. boredom: Doing housework is not typically a way to alleviate boredom unless it\u2019s a distraction from being bored. This doesn\u2019t seem to fit well with the context.\n- B. nice home: While getting a nice home could be a result of cleaning, the immediate goal seems more about the act of cleaning itself rather than the end result.\n- C. michigan: This option is irrelevant and doesn't make sense in the context.\n- D. feeling satisfied: Cleaning up a mess often results in a feeling of satisfaction after completion.\n- E. house clean: This directly states the action of cleaning the house, which aligns with the context but may not capture the full reason for starting the task.\n\nConsidering the context and the options, the most fitting answer is D because the primary reason for starting the housework would be to achieve a feeling of satisfaction once the mess is cleaned up.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: His house was a mess, he began doing housework to get what?
