The phrase \"back taxes\" refers to taxes that were due in previous years but have not been paid yet. The question is asking for another type of tax that contrasts or is similar in nature to back taxes.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Anterior - This term means before in time or order. It doesn't fit the context of types of taxes.\nB. Front - Similar to anterior, it doesn't make sense in the context of tax types.\nC. Main - This term does not directly relate to the timing or classification of taxes.\nD. Front - Same as option B, it doesn't fit.\nE. Current - This term means happening or existing at the present time. In the context of taxes, \"current taxes\" would refer to taxes that are due and payable in the present time, contrasting with \"back taxes.\"\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate term to describe another type of tax in contrast to \"back taxes\" is \"current taxes.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E.

The term \"anterior\" is used in the context of anatomy to mean \"in front,\" which does not logically apply to the concept of taxes being either \"back\" or \"current.\" The question is asking about the nature of taxes that are not \"back taxes,\" meaning taxes that are owed currently rather than from previous years.\n\nGiven the options provided, the most logical choice is:\n\nE. Current\n\nThis is because \"current taxes\" refers to taxes that are due and payable in the present time, as opposed to \"back taxes,\" which are taxes that are owed from previous years.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E.
