Theater**: A theater is a venue designed for performances, including speeches and lectures. It can easily accommodate a scenario where a single person is speaking to an audience.\n- **C. University Campus**: While a university campus may have auditoriums, these spaces are often used for various events, seminars, and lectures, which can involve multiple speakers or participants.\n- **D. Crowd**: A crowd refers to a group of people gathered together. This does not specify a location but rather a collection of individuals.\n- **E. Lights**: Lights are equipment used for illumination and are not locations or venues for speeches.\n\nGiven the context of an auditorium where a single person is speaking, the most appropriate option is a theater, as it is specifically designed for such events.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
