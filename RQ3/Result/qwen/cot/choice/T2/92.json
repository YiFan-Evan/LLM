A reception desk is typically found at the main entry point of an establishment or organization where visitors are greeted and directed.

Office Park**: An office park is a collection of office buildings, often with a central area for common services. While an office park might have a reception desk, it's not a single structure but rather a complex of buildings.\n  \n- **B. Lobby**: A lobby is a large entrance hall or foyer of a building, often where a reception desk would be located. However, the question asks about the location of the reception desk itself, not the type of space it occupies.\n\n- **C. Building**: A reception desk is commonly found at the main entrance of a building. This option is quite broad but accurately describes the general location of a reception desk.\n\n- **D. Hostel**: A hostel is a type of accommodation, and while it might have a reception desk, it is a specific type of building and not a general term that fits all reception desks.\n\n- **E. Motel**: Similar to a hostel, a motel is a specific type of accommodation that has a reception desk but is too specific for the general context of the question.\n\nConsidering these points, the most appropriate and general answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. Building"}]
