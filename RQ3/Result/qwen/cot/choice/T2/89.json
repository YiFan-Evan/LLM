Composted - This term is related to organic decomposition and is not relevant to hair loss.\nB. Bulge - This term suggests an outward swelling, which is not typically associated with hair loss.\nC. Fall out - This term accurately describes the process where hair detaches from the scalp, contributing to a receding hairline.\nD. Grow in ear - This is not a common or relevant phenomenon for male hair loss.\nE.
