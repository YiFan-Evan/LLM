Clerk - This refers to a person who works at a desk or counter, typically not associated with a location where concerts are held.\n\nB.

Auditorium**: An auditorium is a large room or hall designed for gatherings, performances, and presentations. It can host concerts, but the term itself does not necessarily imply the presence of a ticket booth.\n  \n- **B. Venue**: A venue is a place where an event takes place. Concerts are often held at venues, and venues typically have ticket booths for purchasing tickets.\n\n- **C. Movie Theater**: A movie theater is a place for watching films, not concerts. Therefore, it does not fit the criteria.\n\n- **D. Indoors**: This is a general term referring to any indoor space. While concerts can be held indoors, this term is too broad and does not specifically indicate the presence of a ticket booth.\n\n- **E. Clerk**: This refers to a person working at a desk or counter, not a place where you would find a ticket booth or see a concert.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best choice is a place specifically designed for hosting events like concerts and equipped with a ticket booth.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B.
