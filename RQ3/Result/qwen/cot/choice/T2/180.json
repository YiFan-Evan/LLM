Each key can be connected to one or more pipes.\n- Option B (terminal): A terminal is a device for input/output operations in computing and does not involve pipe divisions.\n- Option C (office): An office keyboard is just a generic term for keyboards used in office settings and does not pertain to pipe divisions.\n- Option D (typewriter): A typewriter has a mechanical keyboard used for typing and does not involve pipe divisions.\n- Option E (killing): This option does not make sense in the context of keyboards or pipe divisions.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the only option that correctly describes a keyboard with pipe divisions is an organ.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A."}]
