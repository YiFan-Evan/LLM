The sentence tells us that \"the computer was difficult for him to understand at the store.\" This implies that the person is looking for a way to improve their understanding of computers. \n\nNow, let's look at the options:\n\nA. Classroom - This suggests a formal learning environment where structured lessons are provided.\nB. Facebook - This is a social media platform and not directly related to learning about computers.\nC. School - Similar to a classroom, but it implies a more extended period of learning.\nD. Apartment - This is unrelated to learning about computers.\nE. Demonstration - This could mean attending a demonstration or workshop which could be helpful for learning about computers.\n\nGiven that the person is having trouble understanding computers, they would likely benefit from a more structured and guided approach. Both \"classroom\" and \"school\" suggest such an environment, but since the question implies a quick solution (\"so what did she sign up for\"), a more immediate option like a demonstration might be more fitting.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E.

To resolve this issue and learn more, the person needs a method of learning that can provide clear guidance and practical understanding.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n- A. Demonstration: This could involve a hands-on session where someone shows how to use the computer, which would be very helpful.\n- B. Apartment: This does not relate to learning about computers.\n- C. School: While this provides structured learning, it might be more than what is immediately needed.\n- D. Facebook: This is a social media platform and doesn't offer structured learning about computers.\n- E. Classroom: Similar to school, this offers structured learning but might also be more than what is immediately needed.\n\nGiven the context, the most appropriate choice for immediate and practical learning would be a demonstration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A.
