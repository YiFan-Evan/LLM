Arrive early - While premature babies require special care, this isn't something a baby does after being born; it refers to the timing of birth itself.\n\nB. Learn to walk - Learning to walk is a developmental milestone that actually helps parents because it means the baby is growing and becoming more independent. This doesn\u2019t make raising a baby difficult.\n\nC. Boy or girl - The gender of the baby does not cause difficulties in raising them. It is an inherent characteristic and does not affect the challenges of childcare.\n\nD. Bring joy - Bringing joy is a positive aspect of having a baby and generally doesn\u2019t create problems for parents.\n\nE. Talk nonsense - Babies are unable to speak coherently and their babbling can be seen as \u201cnonsense.\u201d This inability to communicate effectively can lead to frustration for both the baby and the parents as they struggle to understand and meet the baby\u2019s needs.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Joan was a baby, so there were many things she couldn't do, which caused problems for her parents.

Talk nonsense \u2013 Babies cannot speak coherently, making communication challenging for parents. They rely on crying and other non-verbal cues to express themselves.\n\nB. Bring joy \u2013 While bringing joy is certainly a positive aspect, it does not contribute to the difficulties of raising a baby.\n\nC. Boy or girl \u2013 The gender of the baby does not inherently create difficulties in raising them.\n\nD. Learn to walk \u2013 Learning to walk is a developmental milestone that signifies progress and independence, not a source of difficulty.\n\nE. Arrive early \u2013 Premature babies indeed require extra care, but the question implies the baby is a newborn, so this situation is not directly relevant here.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most fitting answer is the inability to communicate effectively through speech, which leads to misunderstandings and challenges for parents.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A."}]
