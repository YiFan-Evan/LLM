The sentence describes a situation where Sam is staring at someone's bare butt.\n2. We need to find an adjective that describes the butt and fits well in the context.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Full - This could describe a body part but doesn\u2019t emphasize the visual aspect or the fact that it is bare.\nB. Ample - This means plentiful or abundant, which can be used to describe a well-shaped or sizable butt. It also fits the context because it suggests that the butt is noticeable.\nC. Covered - This contradicts the statement that the butt was bare.\nD. Bareword - This is not a common adjective and does not make sense in the context.\nE. Ample - This is a repetition of option B and carries the same meaning.\n\nSince \"ample\" best describes the noticeable and sizable characteristic of the butt, and it aligns with the context that the butt is bare, the most appropriate choice is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The butt was bare, and Sam couldn't stop staring at it.
