The question mentions \"back taxes\" and asks for another type of tax that Joe owed. \n\n- \"Back taxes\" typically refers to taxes that are overdue or unpaid from previous years.\n- We need to identify a term that contrasts with \"back taxes\" and indicates taxes that are due currently or regularly.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\nA. Anterior - This term means before in time or position and doesn't relate to taxes.\nB. Front - Similar to \"anterior,\" this term does not specifically refer to taxes.\nC. Main - This term is too general and does not specify the timing of taxes.\nD. Front - This is a duplicate of option B and can be disregarded.\nE. Current - This term means happening or existing now and would logically contrast with \"back taxes\" by indicating taxes that are due presently.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most appropriate term to describe taxes that are due currently is \"current.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Joe owned back taxes as well as what other type of taxes?\nOptions: A. current B. front C. main D. front E. anterior"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The question is asking about the other type of taxes that Joe owed besides back taxes.
