The sentence states that Sarah gave \"a guy\" (likely a reference to a key or tool) to her home. We need to determine what action he could have performed while she was gone.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. front door - This doesn't make sense as an action.\nB. turn lock - This implies using the item to lock or unlock a door, which is plausible.\nC. solution to problem - This is too vague and not related to the given item.\nD. install - This is also vague and doesn't fit the context of using a key-like item.\nE. open doors - This fits well with the idea of using a key or similar item to gain entry.\n\nGiven the context, the most logical action for the item given to him would be to open doors.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Sarah gave her brother a guy to her home.
