Table**: It is uncommon for someone to step in gum left on a table. This is an unlikely scenario.\n- **B. Water Fountain**: Gum is not typically associated with water fountains, and it\u2019s unlikely that someone would step in gum here.\n- **C. Sidewalk**: Sidewalks are often littered with discarded gum, making it highly probable for someone to step in gum while walking.\n- **D. Movies**: Although people may chew gum in movies, it\u2019s less likely for gum to end up on a shoe directly from a movie theater floor compared to a sidewalk.\n- **E. Shelf**: Gum on a shelf is usually inside packaging and not exposed, making it improbable for someone to step in gum from a shelf.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most plausible source of gum on a shoe is the sidewalk.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}]
