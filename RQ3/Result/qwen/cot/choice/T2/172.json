Bank**: Banks often require high levels of security due to the presence of valuable assets and sensitive information. Revolving doors are commonly used here.\n- **B. Library**: Libraries typically do not require such stringent security measures.\n- **C. Department Store**: While these may have some security, they generally do not need revolving doors as a primary security measure.\n- **D. Mall**: Malls have security, but it\u2019s usually not as stringent as that required by banks.\n- **E.
