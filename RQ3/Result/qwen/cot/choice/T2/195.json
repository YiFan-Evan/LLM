It can be added later after the establishment is operational.\n\n3. **Building (Option E)** is a critical component for any restaurant or business. Without a physical space, it is impossible to operate a steakhouse. This would be the foundational step before any other actions such as acquiring inventory, hiring staff, or marketing the business.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E.

Building**: This is crucial because without a physical location, there is no place to run the steakhouse.\n- **B. Texas, D. Florida, and E. Michigan**: These are states and do not directly contribute to the operational setup of the steakhouse itself.\n- **C. Wine**: While this could be an item on the menu, it is not necessary to acquire this initially when setting up the basic infrastructure of the steakhouse.\n\nGiven that a building provides the necessary physical space for the steakhouse operations, it logically follows that obtaining a building should be the first step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A.
