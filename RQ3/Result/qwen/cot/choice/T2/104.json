Anemones are marine animals that often have bright colors and a flower-like appearance. \n\n- Option A: Florida Keys - This is a geographical location and does not relate to an object found on window sills.\n- Option B: Flower bed - This is a terrestrial feature, but the idea of flowers or plants in a flower bed could be analogous to the flower-like appearance of anemones.\n- Option C: Under water - This is a habitat, not an object found on window sills.\n- Option D: Coral sea - This is a marine environment where anemones live, but it does not describe an object found on window sills.\n- Option E: Intertidal zone - This is another habitat where anemones can be found, but it does not describe an object found on window sills.\n\nThe closest analogy to an anemone's appearance is a flower, and flower beds contain flowers. Objects resembling flowers, such as small potted plants or decorative items, are often found on window sills.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
