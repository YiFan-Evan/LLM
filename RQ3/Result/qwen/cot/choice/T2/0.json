Illinois**: This is a state known for its farmland, but it is not something that farmland itself uses.\n- **B. Farming areas**: This directly describes the nature of farmland; farmland is an area dedicated to farming.\n- **C. North Dakota**: Like Illinois, this is another state known for its farmland, but it is not something that farmland uses.\n- **D. Michigan**: Another state known for its farmland, but not something that farmland uses.\n- **E. Countryside**: While farmland can be found in the countryside, this term is more about the location rather than the direct use of farmland.\n\nThe most appropriate option that directly describes what farmland makes use of is \"farming areas.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
