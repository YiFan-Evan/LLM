However, the most direct and immediate effect is likely to be sleepiness due to physical exertion and emotional relaxation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What does going to bed with your spouse for sex lead to?\nOptions: A. get pregnant B. sleepiness C. rest D. a good nights sleep E. bad dreams"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The question asks about the immediate and primary outcome of going to bed with your spouse for sex.
