Cling film - Using cling film would cover the pen's nib and might prevent it from drying out by blocking exposure to air. However, it is impractical and inconvenient to use regularly.\n\nB. Caps - Caps are specifically designed to cover the nib of a pen, protecting it from drying out when not in use. This is a common and practical solution.\n\nC. Ink cartridges - These are components of the pen that hold ink, but they do not directly prevent the ink from drying out once exposed to air.\n\nD. Ink in - This option is vague and doesn't specify a protective measure against drying out.\n\nE. Write sentences on paper - Writing with the pen keeps the ink moist temporarily but does not prevent it from drying out over time when the pen is not in use.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most effective and practical solution is using a cap.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
