The practice involves hunting foxes with a pack of hounds, often on large rural estates, which aligns with the lifestyle of an aristocrat.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n- **A. North Dakota**: This state in the U.S. does not have a strong tradition of aristocratic fox hunting.\n- **B. Arkansas**: Similar to North Dakota, this state lacks a significant aristocratic tradition related to fox hunting.\n- **C. Street**: This is not a valid option as it does not represent a residential area.\n- **D. New Hampshire**: While fox hunting occurs in parts of the United States, it is not strongly associated with aristocratic traditions.\n- **E. England**: This country has a rich history of aristocratic fox hunting, making it the most plausible option.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. England"}]
