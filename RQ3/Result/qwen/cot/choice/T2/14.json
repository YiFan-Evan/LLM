Punctured - This would be true because having a hole means the ball is punctured.\nB. Popular in America - The popularity of basketball in America is unrelated to whether the ball has a hole or not. This statement is about the sport's popularity, not the condition of the ball.\nC. Full of air - This would likely not be true because a punctured ball would probably lose some or all of its air.\nD. Gone - This would not be true because the ball still exists even though it has a hole.\nE. Round - This could still be true if the hole does not significantly alter the overall roundness of the ball.\n\nSince we are looking for the statement that would not be true, and considering the context of the question focuses on the physical state of the ball itself, the most fitting answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B.
