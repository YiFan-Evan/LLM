Parachutes: Historically, silk was used in parachutes due to its strength and lightness, but it is not the most common or typical use for showcasing silk's luxurious qualities.\n- B. Expensive clothing: Silk is often used in high-end fashion because of its smooth texture, sheen, and comfort, making it a fitting choice for showcasing silk.\n- C. Garments: This is a broad category that includes all types of clothing, some of which may use silk. However, it is less specific than \"expensive clothing\" in highlighting the luxurious nature of silk.\n- D. Mulberry tree: This is the plant that silkworms feed on, and while it is crucial to the production of silk, it does not showcase the material itself.\n- E. Jean: Jeans are traditionally made from denim, which is primarily cotton-based, so they are not typically made from silk and do not showcase silk's qualities.\n\nGiven the context of showcasing silk's luxurious qualities, expensive clothing stands out as the most appropriate choice.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
