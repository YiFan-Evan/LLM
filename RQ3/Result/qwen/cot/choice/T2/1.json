It is too broad to specify a range of 1000 to 10000 restaurants within a single location.\n- **Small Town**: Small towns typically do not have a high density of restaurants. The number of restaurants in a small town is unlikely to reach 1000, let alone 10000.\n- **Town**: While towns are larger than small towns, they still may not have enough restaurants to reach the specified range.\n- **Big City**: Big cities have a high population density and a diverse range of businesses, including a large number of restaurants. It is plausible for a big city to have between 1000 and 10000 restaurants.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. big city"}]
