Start reproduction - This does not happen immediately after birth; it occurs much later in life.\nB. Death - Birth implies the beginning of life, so death does not occur immediately after birth.\nC. Sometimes bad - This is too vague and does not describe a specific event or process.\nD. Growing older - This is a continuous process that starts after birth but does not happen immediately upon birth.\nE.
