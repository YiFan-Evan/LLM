Basement - A basement is typically part of a building and not something you would buy at a shop.\nB. Cardboard Box - A cardboard box is an item that can be purchased at a shop and used to store or transport items.\nC. Ocean Floor - The ocean floor is not something you can buy or use to store items.\nD. High School - A high school is an educational institution and not an object for storing items.\nE. Container - A container is an object that can be bought at a shop and used to store items.\n\nGiven these analyses, the best option for storing spare unused things that can be bought at a shop is either a cardboard box or a container. However, since containers are more commonly associated with storage purposes and are available in various forms suitable for different needs, it is the most appropriate choice.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E.

However, the question seems to lean towards a specific type of container, and \"cardboard box\" is more commonly recognized as a store-bought item for this purpose.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. Cardboard box"}]
