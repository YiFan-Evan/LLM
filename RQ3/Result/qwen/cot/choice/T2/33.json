The sentence describes someone who is very outgoing and finds it easy to make friends. We are looking for a word that represents something negative or challenging related to making friends.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. scary - This could fit as making friends might not be scary for an outgoing person.\nB. having friends - This does not make sense in the context since the sentence implies he makes friends easily.\nC. good feeling - This is positive and does not fit the context of something that would be challenging.\nD. conflict - This could fit, but it is not specifically about the act of making friends.\nE. friendship - This also does not fit because the sentence is talking about the act of making friends, not the state of having friends.\n\nThe most fitting option is A. \"scary,\" as it represents something negative or challenging that would not apply to an outgoing person making friends.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: He was very outgoing, for him making friends was no personal what?\nOptions: A. friendship B. conflict C. good feeling D. having friends E. scary"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The sentence describes someone who is very outgoing and finds it easy to make friends.
