Getting tired: This is a gradual process and typically doesn't stop someone suddenly.\n- B. Exhaustion: Similar to getting tired, exhaustion usually builds up over time and isn't an immediate stop.\n- C. Sweating: Sweating is a normal bodily function during exercise and doesn't suddenly stop someone.\n- D. Falling down: This is a sudden event that would immediately stop someone from running.\n- E. Mushroom: Mushrooms are generally not large enough to cause someone to trip or stop suddenly while running.\n\nAmong these options, falling down is the only event that would abruptly halt someone's running motion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D"}]
