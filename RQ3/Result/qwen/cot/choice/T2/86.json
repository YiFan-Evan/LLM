Death**: While theoretically possible due to severe food poisoning or choking, this is extremely rare as an immediate side effect.\n- **C. Illness**: Similar to nausea, illness can happen soon after eating a contaminated hamburger.\n- **D. Health Problems**: These can develop over time from regular consumption of unhealthy foods, but they are not immediate.\n- **E.

Gain weight**: Gaining weight is a long-term effect that generally occurs over time with repeated consumption of calorie-dense foods like hamburgers. It is not an immediate side effect.\n- **B. Health problems**: Health problems such as heart disease or diabetes are chronic conditions that develop over extended periods due to regular consumption of unhealthy foods. They are not immediate side effects.\n- **C. Illness**: Eating a contaminated or undercooked hamburger can lead to immediate illness, such as food poisoning.\n- **D. Death**: Although theoretically possible due to severe foodborne illness or choking, death is an extremely rare immediate side effect.\n- **E. Nausea**: Nausea can occur shortly after eating a hamburger, especially if it is spoiled or if the person has a sensitivity or allergy to ingredients in the hamburger.\n\nConsidering the immediacy and likelihood of each side effect:\n\n- Options C (illness), D (death), and E (nausea) are all possible immediate side effects.\n- Option B (health problems) is more of a long-term concern.\n- Option A (gain weight) is the least likely immediate side effect.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A."}]
