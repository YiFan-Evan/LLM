It fits well with the context of preparing for a game.\nB. **Practical** - This is an adjective and does not fit as a verb in the sentence.\nC. **Fact** - This is a noun and does not fit as a verb in the sentence.\nD. **Practice** - This is also a valid verb meaning to perform an action repeatedly to improve skill or familiarity. It fits well with the context of preparing for a game.\nE. **Park** - This is a verb related to sports but does not fit the context of repeated preparation for a game.\n\nBoth \"practise\" and \"practice\" are correct verbs, but since the context seems to favor the American English spelling, \"practice\" is more appropriate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D"}]
