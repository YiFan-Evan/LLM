Let's analyze each option:\n\n- A. \"lot of\": This phrase means a large amount, which is the opposite of a little.\n- B. \"big\": This term refers to size rather than quantity, so it does not fit the context.\n- C. \"more\": This term suggests an increase in quantity but does not necessarily imply a large amount.\n- D. \"plenty\": This word means a sufficient or abundant amount, which is also the opposite of a little.\n- E. \"much\": This term means a large quantity, which fits well as the opposite of a little.\n\nAmong these options, both \"lot of\" and \"plenty\" are very close in meaning to the opposite of \"a little.\" However, \"plenty\" is more commonly used in this context.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}]
