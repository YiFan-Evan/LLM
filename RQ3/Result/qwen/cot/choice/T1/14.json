Punctured - If there is a hole in the basketball, it is indeed punctured. This statement can be true.\nB. Popular in America - The popularity of the basketball is unrelated to whether it has a hole or not. This statement is unrelated to the condition of the ball.\nC. Full of air - A hole would cause air to escape, so the basketball would not be full of air anymore. This statement would not be true.\nD. Gone - The basketball still exists, even though it has a hole. This statement would not be true.\nE. Round - Even with a hole, as long as the basketball does not lose its general shape, it can still appear round. This statement can be true.\n\nThe statements that would not be true are those that describe an inherent contradiction given the conditions stated. Among these, \"gone\" and \"full of air\" are clear contradictions. However, since \"gone\" is less directly related to the physical state of the ball compared to being full of air, \"full of air\" is the most direct contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}]
