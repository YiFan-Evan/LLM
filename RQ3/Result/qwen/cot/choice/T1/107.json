Since all other options are incorrect or do not fit well with the immediate events following birth, the best choice among the given options is:\n\n**B.

Expiration**: This refers to the act of breathing out or expiring air, but it does not accurately describe the immediate event right after birth.\n- **B. Growing older**: While true that a newborn starts to age from the moment of birth, this is a continuous process rather than an immediate event.\n- **C. Sometimes bad**: This option is vague and does not specify a specific event or process.\n- **D. Death**: Birth is the beginning of life, so death is not something that happens immediately after birth.\n- **E. Start reproduction**: Reproduction typically occurs much later in life, not immediately after birth.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer among the options provided is that immediately after birth, a living being starts the process of breathing, which is part of the initial life processes. However, since none of the options explicitly mention breathing, the closest logical choice related to the immediate post-birth process is:\n\n**B. Growing older**\n\nThis implies that from the moment of birth, the process of aging begins, even though it might not be the most immediate event.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
