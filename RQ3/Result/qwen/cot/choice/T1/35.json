High School - Typically, high schools are well-established institutions that often have dedicated cafeterias for students. These cafeterias usually follow certain standards set by educational authorities.\n\nB. Canteen - This term can refer to any food service area but does not specify a particular type of institution. The quality of a canteen can vary widely depending on its context.\n\nC. Polytechnic - Polytechnics are educational institutions that focus on practical and vocational education.
