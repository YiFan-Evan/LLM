Their primary duty is to ensure public safety and respond to emergencies.\n- **D. direct traffic**: This action is unrelated to hearing a cry for help. It pertains more to managing traffic flow.\n- **C. fine motorists**: This action is also unrelated to hearing a cry for help. It involves enforcing traffic laws.\n- **B. hurry along**: While this implies movement, it does not specify the purpose and is less specific than helping someone in distress.\n- **A. run away**: This is highly unlikely and contrary to the duties and responsibilities of a policeman.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate action for the policemen to take when they hear a cry from a distance is to help.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. help"}]
