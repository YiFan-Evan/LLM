The presence of \"more than one bum asking for change or a ticket\" indicates a location where people frequently request tickets or money.\n2. \"It was the cheapest way to travel\" points towards a low-cost mode of transportation.\n3. \"No surprise sight\" implies that this scenario is common and expected in this location.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Train Station - While people do ask for tickets here, train travel can be relatively expensive compared to other options.\nB. Beach - This location is not typically associated with people asking for tickets or change, nor is it a primary mode of transportation.\nC. Bus Depot - Buses are often the cheapest form of public transportation, and it is common to see people asking for change or tickets at bus depots.\nD. Bridge - People might ask for change on a bridge, but it is not a primary mode of transportation.\nE. Stumblebum - This term does not fit logically into the context of the sentence.\n\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer is the bus depot, as it aligns with all the clues provided in the question.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}]
