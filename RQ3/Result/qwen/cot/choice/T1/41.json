People believe - This suggests that the child didn't understand the importance or reality of others' beliefs. This could fit since children often view adult beliefs as something imaginary or not real.\n\nB. Daydreams - This doesn't make sense because the child is already comparing things to pretend, and daydreams are inherently imaginary.\n\nC. Transcendentalism - This philosophical concept is complex and abstract, likely beyond the understanding of a child. However, it doesn\u2019t fit the context of something being perceived as pretend.\n\nD. Laughter - This doesn't fit well because laughter is typically understood by children and doesn't align with the idea of something being pretend.\n\nE. Religion - While some children might view religious concepts as imaginary or pretend, it's more specific than the general sense provided in the sentence.\n\nConsidering the context and the nature of the question, the most fitting option is A.

People believe - This option implies that the child does not understand the significance or reality of other people's beliefs. It fits well because a child might perceive adults' serious beliefs as something imaginary or not real.\n\nB. Daydreams - This doesn't fit well because daydreams are already considered imaginary by definition.\n\nC.

Laughter - This also doesn't fit because laughter is generally understood by children and isn't typically perceived as pretend.\n\nE.
