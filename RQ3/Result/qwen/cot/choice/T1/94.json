Let's analyze each option:\n\n- **A. feel important**: This doesn't make sense because feeling important is a state of mind rather than something one \"has.\"\n- **B. trust himself**: Similar to option A, trusting oneself is a state of mind and not something one \"has.\"\n- **C. own house**: Owning a house is an achievement or possession, but it's not typically something one \"has\" in the context of a question about what they are likely to do.\n- **D. electrical circuit**: An electrical circuit is an object or concept, not something related to what a person is likely to do.\n- **E. know what time**: Knowing what time it is is a skill or ability that someone can have, and it implies an action of checking or being aware of the time.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most logical option is E, as it fits the idea of a person having a skill or ability that influences their actions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}]
