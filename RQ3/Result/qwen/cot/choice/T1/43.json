The individual has curiosity but is blind and paralyzed, which means they cannot rely on visual information or physical interaction with objects.\n\n- Option A (hear news) could be a viable option since it involves using auditory information, which is still accessible.\n- Option B (analyse) is also a potential option because it doesn't require any sensory input or physical movement; it can be done mentally.\n- Option C (go somewhere) is not feasible due to paralysis.\n- Option D (examine thing) is not possible due to blindness and paralysis.\n- Option E (see favorite show) is not possible due to blindness.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best options are A or B.

See favorite show**: This option is not feasible because seeing requires sight, which the individual does not have due to blindness.\n  \n- **D. Examine thing**: This action typically involves touch or vision, both of which are not available to the individual due to blindness and paralysis.\n  \n- **C. Go somewhere**: Physical movement is impossible due to paralysis, making this option unfeasible.\n  \n- **B. Analyse**: This option involves mental processing and does not require any sensory input or physical movement. It is a cognitive activity that can be performed despite the physical and sensory limitations.\n  \n- **A. Hear news**: This option relies on auditory perception, which is a viable sense for the individual. Listening to news can satisfy curiosity by providing information through sound.\n\nConsidering the limitations and the requirement to satisfy curiosity, the most suitable options are B and A. However, since the question implies an active engagement with information, hearing news seems to be a more direct way to engage with new and varied content.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A."}]
