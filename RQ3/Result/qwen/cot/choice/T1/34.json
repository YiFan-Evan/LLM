Countryside - The countryside generally includes open areas with some trees and possibly small bodies of water like ponds.\nE. Rural area - Similar to the countryside, a rural area can include various landscapes such as fields, forests, and ponds.\n\nConsidering that a pond surrounded by trees implies a more natural setting rather than an urban or indoor environment, both options C, D, and E are plausible.
