James is carrying a duffel bag.\n2. He doesn't have a vehicle of his own.\n3. He needs a bag to carry his things.\n\nFrom these points, we can infer that James is likely traveling or commuting without personal transportation. Therefore, he would be using some form of public or shared transportation where a duffel bag would be necessary for carrying his belongings.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Library - This does not require carrying a duffel bag for transportation purposes.\nB. Transit - This could include various forms of public transportation, which would make sense for someone without a vehicle who needs to carry items.\nC.
