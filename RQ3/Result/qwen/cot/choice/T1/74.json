The question asks for another type of tax that would be categorized alongside back taxes.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n- A. Anterior: This term means before in time or order, which doesn't directly relate to types of taxes.\n- B. Front: This term is similar to 'anterior' and also doesn't directly describe a type of tax.\n- C. Main: While this could imply significant or primary taxes, it's not a specific term used for categorizing types of taxes.\n- D. Front: This option is repeated and thus irrelevant.\n- E. Current: This term implies taxes that are due or payable now.\n\nGiven the context of back taxes, which are unpaid from the past, the logical counterpart would be taxes that are due currently. Hence, \"current\" fits best as it contrasts with \"back\" by referring to taxes owed in the present.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E.

Back taxes refer to taxes that were owed but not paid in previous years. The other type of tax mentioned should logically contrast or complement the concept of back taxes.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- A. anterior: This term means preceding in time or order and does not specifically refer to taxes.\n- B. front: This term is not typically used in the context of taxes and does not provide a meaningful distinction.\n- C. main: This term is too vague and does not specifically refer to a type of tax.\n- D. front: This option is repeated and still does not make sense in the context of taxes.\n- E. current: This term refers to taxes that are due or payable now, contrasting with back taxes which are from the past.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. current"}]
