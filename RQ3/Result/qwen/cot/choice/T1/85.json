Joe was thrown from his boat into the water.\n2. It was the middle of winter, so the water was cold.\n3. He cried out to his crew for help.\n4. His crew couldn't hear him over the sound of something.\n\nGiven these points, we need to identify what could create a significant noise that would prevent the crew from hearing Joe\u2019s cries for help.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n- **A. Surface of earth**: This doesn't make sense in the context of a boat scenario.\n- **B. Teardrops**: While Joe might be crying, tears wouldn\u2019t produce a loud noise.\n- **C. Snowflake**: Snowflakes falling wouldn\u2019t create a significant sound that would drown out Joe\u2019s voice.\n- **D. Typhoon**: While a typhoon could produce a lot of noise, it\u2019s not mentioned in the context and seems too extreme for a typical scenario.\n- **E. Motor**: Boats typically have motors, and in rough conditions or during a rescue, the motor noise could easily drown out a person\u2019s cry for help.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most logical choice is the motor.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E.
