They are often simple reminders or lists, and people tend to write them legibly because they want to read them quickly.\n\n- **B. sheet music**: Sheet music is designed to be read clearly by musicians. While some handwritten notes might be difficult to read if the handwriting is poor, the primary content of sheet music is usually legible and well-structured.\n\n- **C. desk**: Notes on a desk could be messy or disorganized, but they are generally meant to be readable by the person who wrote them. However, they might get buried under other papers.\n\n- **D. bed**: Notes near a bed might be hastily written or small, and they could be easily overlooked among bedding and pillows, making them hard to find and read.\n\n- **E. medical chart**: Medical charts often contain complex and detailed information, and they are frequently handwritten by various healthcare professionals. This can lead to illegible handwriting and abbreviations that are hard to decipher.\n\nGiven these considerations, medical charts are the most likely place to find a hard-to-read note due to the complexity and potential illegibility of the writing.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}]
