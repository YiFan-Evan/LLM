Nausea**: This can occur quickly if the hamburger is undercooked, spoiled, or contains ingredients that do not agree with the individual.\n- **B. Death**: While theoretically possible due to severe food poisoning or an allergic reaction, it is extremely unlikely to happen immediately after eating a hamburger.\n- **C. Illness**: Similar to nausea, illness can occur if the hamburger is not properly prepared or stored, leading to bacterial infections or other illnesses.\n- **D. Health Problems**: These are typically long-term consequences resulting from repeated consumption of unhealthy foods rather than an immediate side effect.\n- **E. Gain Weight**: Weight gain is a gradual process that occurs over time with consistent caloric intake exceeding expenditure.\n\nGiven these evaluations, gaining weight (E) and health problems (D) are less likely to be immediate side effects compared to nausea, illness, or even death. However, among the given options, gaining weight is the least likely immediate side effect because it takes time to manifest.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}]
