Shelf**: It's highly unlikely that someone would step on gum that was left on a shelf.\n- **B. Movies**: While people do chew gum in movie theaters, it's less likely that the gum would end up on your shoe compared to other more direct contact scenarios.\n- **C. Sidewalk**: This is a very common place for finding gum. People often drop or step on gum that has been left on sidewalks.\n- **D. Water Fountain**: It's possible but uncommon for gum to stick to your shoe at a water fountain.\n- **E. Table**: Gum is more likely to be placed on a table and then discarded or dropped, rather than ending up on your shoe.\n\nConsidering these points, the most logical and common scenario is encountering gum on a sidewalk.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. sidewalk"}]
