Water - This is a very broad term that includes oceans, seas, rivers, and lakes. Most uses of boats in water would require navigation skills to avoid hazards and reach destinations safely.\n\nB. Ocean - The ocean is vast and complex, requiring significant navigation skills to navigate safely due to unpredictable weather, currents, and long distances.\n\nC. Garage - A garage is a place for storing vehicles on land. It is not a body of water, so using a boat in a garage is not possible and therefore does not require any navigation skills.\n\nD. Harbor - Harbors are relatively calm and controlled environments, often having marked channels and buoys to guide boats. While some basic navigation skills might be helpful, they are generally not as critical as in open waters.\n\nE. River - Rivers can have strong currents and various navigational challenges such as rocks, rapids, and narrow passages. Navigation skills are often necessary to navigate them safely.\n\nGiven this analysis, the best option where using a boat would not require navigation skills is a garage, as it is not a body of water.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}]
