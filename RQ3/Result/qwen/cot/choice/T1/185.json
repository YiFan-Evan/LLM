It does not fit here as an emotion caused by killing.\n  \n- **C. joy**: This is an emotion, and it is generally considered inappropriate and morally wrong to feel joy from causing someone's death.\n  \n- **D. afraid**: This is an emotion, and fear can be a reasonable reaction after committing such an act, either due to legal consequences or personal guilt.\n  \n- **E. terrible**: This term describes a state or feeling rather than a specific emotion, so it is less precise in this context.\n\nAmong these options, the emotion that killing should not cause is joy because it is morally and ethically inappropriate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C"}]
