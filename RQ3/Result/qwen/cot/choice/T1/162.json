We need to identify what specifically ends due to this discovery.\n\n- Option A (relationship): An affair can cause a relationship to deteriorate, but the term \"relationship\" is broad and does not directly signify the formal dissolution or end of the marital bond.\n- Option B (marriage): Although an affair may lead to divorce, the immediate consequence of discovering an affair does not necessarily mean the marriage itself has ended.\n- Option C (fidelity): This refers to faithfulness in the marriage, which would indeed be compromised, but it is a concept rather than something that ends.\n- Option D (love): This is subjective and not necessarily something that ends upon the discovery of an affair; it can continue or diminish over time.\n- Option E (divorce): While an affair can lead to divorce, the immediate consequence of discovering the affair does not necessarily mean the couple has initiated legal proceedings for divorce.\n\nThe most direct and immediate consequence of discovering an affair is often the end of fidelity and trust within the marriage, which are foundational elements of a marriage. However, since we are looking for a term that represents the direct outcome, the most appropriate answer is the end of the relationship as a unit, which encompasses both emotional and practical aspects of their bond.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. relationship"}]
