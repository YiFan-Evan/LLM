Housing estate - This typically consists of closely situated houses or apartments, so it is unlikely to have no neighbors.\nB. Neighborhood - Similar to a housing estate, this area is designed for people to live close together, making it improbable to have no neighbors.\nC. Mars - While currently uninhabited by humans, Mars is not an option for living right now due to technological and logistical limitations.\nD. Woods - Living in a remote part of the woods could mean being far from other human inhabitants, thus having no neighbors.\nE.

It is unlikely that someone would have no neighbors here.\n  \n- **D. woods**: Living in the woods means being surrounded by nature. If one were to choose a very remote area in the woods, it is possible to live without any human neighbors.\n  \n- **C. mars**: While Mars is a potential future habitat for humans, it is not currently inhabited by humans, and reaching there involves significant challenges. Thus, it is not a practical option for immediate living.\n  \n- **B. neighborhood**: A neighborhood is a residential area where people live close to each other, making it highly unlikely to have no neighbors.\n  \n- **A. housing estate**: A housing estate consists of several homes grouped together, which means it is densely populated and having no neighbors is practically impossible.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most feasible option for living with no neighbors is the woods, especially in a remote area.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D.woods"}]
