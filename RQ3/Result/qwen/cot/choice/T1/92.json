Motel - While motels often have a reception area, it is not necessarily always at the front entrance.\nB. Hostel - Similar to motels, hostels can vary in their layout, but the reception may not always be exactly at the front entrance.\nC. Building - This is a broad term that could include any structure with a reception desk, which is typically placed at the front entrance for easy access.\nD.

A reception desk is generally located at the main entrance or front area of a facility to greet visitors and manage access. \n\n- **E. office park**: An office park is an area containing several office buildings, so it is too broad and does not specifically imply a reception desk at the front entrance.\n- **D. lobby**: A lobby is a common area inside a building where a reception desk is often placed, but the question asks for the broader location of the reception desk.\n- **C. building**: A reception desk can be found in various types of buildings such as offices, hotels, and other facilities, making this a suitable general answer.\n- **B. hostel**: A hostel typically has a reception desk, but it is a more specific type of building.\n- **A. motel**: Similar to a hostel, a motel also has a reception desk, but again, it is a more specific type of building.\n\nConsidering the broader context and the fact that a reception desk can be found in many types of buildings, the most appropriate answer is \"building.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}]
