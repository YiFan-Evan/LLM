[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If the index is out of bounds, it returns `-1`.\n\n2. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates from `t = 0` to `t < len(arr)`. During each iteration, it checks if the current index `t` matches the given `id`.
