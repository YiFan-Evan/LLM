The function's purpose is to find the minimum value in an array. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `min_value` is set to the first element of the array (`arr[0]`). At this point, `min_value` is the minimum value of the elements seen so far (which is just the first element).\n\n2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `h` is less than the length of the array.\n\n3. **Loop Body**: Inside the loop, the current element `arr[h]` is compared with `min_value`. If `arr[h]` is smaller, `min_value` is updated to `arr[h]`.\n\n4. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `h` equals the length of the array. At this point, `min_value` should hold the smallest element from the entire array.\n\nTo establish a loop invariant, consider the state of the array up to index `h-1` (the elements processed so far).
