This means that before any elements have been checked, the count of occurrences of `target` is 0.\n\n2. **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the loop, the variable `k` increments from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`. If the current element `arr[k]` equals the `target`, then `count_value` is incremented by 1.
