The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

At this point, no elements have been added to `sum_value`, so it correctly holds the sum of the elements processed so far, which is zero.\n\n2. **Loop Execution**: During each iteration of the loop, the current element `arr[k]` is added to `sum_value`, and `k` is incremented by 1. This means that after each iteration, `sum_value` contains the sum of the first `k` elements of `arr`.\n\n3. **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `k` equals `len(arr)`, meaning all elements of `arr` have been processed.
