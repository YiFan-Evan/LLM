[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The function's purpose is to count the number of occurrences of a specific target value within an array.\n\n### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n1. **Identify the Loop and Variables:**\n   - The loop iterates over the array `arr` using the index `f`.\n   - The variable `count_value` keeps track of the number of occurrences of the target value.\n   \n2. **Define the Loop Invariant:**\n   - We need a statement that remains true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n   - A suitable candidate would be the value of `count_value` which represents the count of occurrences up to the current index `f`.\n\n3. **Formulate the Invariant:**\n   - Before the loop starts, `count_value` is initialized to 0.\n   - After each iteration, `count_value` should reflect the number of times the target value has been found from the start of the array up to the current index `f`.\n\n4. **Formulate the Invariant Statement:**\n   - The loop invariant can be stated as `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[:f] if x == target)`.
