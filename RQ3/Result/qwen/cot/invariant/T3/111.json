[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If the index `l` matches `id`, it assigns `arr[l]` to `member_value`.\n- **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates from `l = 0` to `l < len(arr)`. \n\n### Loop Invariant:\nA loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.
