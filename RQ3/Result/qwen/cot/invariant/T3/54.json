Given the objective is to count the occurrences of `target` in `arr`, we can formulate the invariant as follows:\n\n- Before the i-th iteration, `count_value` should represent the count of `target` in the subarray `arr[len(arr)-i:len(arr)]`.\n\nFormally, this can be expressed as:\n- `count_value` is equal to the number of elements in `arr[o:len(arr)]` that are equal to `target`.\n\nSince `o` starts from `len(arr)` and decreases to 0, we can rewrite the invariant as:\n- `count_value` is equal to the number of elements in `arr[o:len(arr)]` that are equal to `target`.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be written as:\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[o:len(arr)] if x == target)`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the analysis, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be stated as:\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[o:len(arr)] if x == target)`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[o:len(arr)] if x == target)`"}]
