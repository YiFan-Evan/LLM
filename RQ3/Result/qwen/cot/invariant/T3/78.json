[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If it does, `id_value` is updated to `s`. Otherwise, `id_value` remains unchanged.\n3. **Termination**: After the loop ends (`s = 0`), `id_value` will hold the index of the last occurrence of `target` in the array `arr`.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\n\nThe loop invariant should reflect that `id_value` contains the index of the last occurrence of `target` in the subarray `arr[s+1]->arr[len(arr)-1]`.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n- `id_value = fun(arr[s+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])`, where `fun` returns the index of the last occurrence of `target` in the subarray `arr[s+1]->arr[len(arr)-1]`, or `-1` if `target` does not occur.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nid_value = fun(arr[s+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])\n```"}]
