[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It then iterates over the array, updating `last_value` with the current element at each step until it reaches the end of the array. Finally, it returns `last_value`.\n\n### Loop Invariant Identification:\nWe want to find a statement that remains true before and after each iteration of the loop.
