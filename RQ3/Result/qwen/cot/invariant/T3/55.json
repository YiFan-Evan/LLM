At this point, no elements have been processed, so `count_value` correctly represents the count of occurrences of `target` in the portion of the array from index 0 to -1 (an empty portion).\n\n2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `p < len(arr)`. This means that the loop processes each element of the array exactly once.\n\n3. **Loop Body**:\n   - If `arr[p] == target`, then `count_value` is incremented by 1.\n   - Regardless of whether `arr[p] == target` or not, `p` is incremented by 1.\n\n4. **Invariant Hypothesis**: We need to find a statement that holds true at the start of each iteration.

This means that the loop processes each element of the array in reverse order, starting from the last element down to the first element.\n\n3. **Loop Body**:\n   - `p` is decremented by 1.\n   - If `arr[p] == target`, then `count_value` is incremented by 1.\n\n4. **Invariant Hypothesis**: We need to find a statement that holds true at the start of each iteration.
