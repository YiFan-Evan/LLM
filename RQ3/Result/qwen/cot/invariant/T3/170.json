Specifically, after the k-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `k` elements of the array are sorted, and every element from index `k` onwards has not been moved out of its initial position.\n\nGiven this, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\n- Before the start of the k-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0] -> arr[k-1]` is sorted.\n- Elements in the subarray `arr[k] -> arr[len(arr)-1]` are not necessarily in their final positions but have not been moved out of their initial positions.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be written as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[k-1])`\n- `unmoved_value = fun(arr[k]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\n\nHowever, since the exact function `fun` isn't specified, we can use simpler terms:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:k]`\n- `unmoved_value = arr[k:len(arr)]`\n\nCombining these, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:k]`\n- `unmoved_value = arr[k:len(arr)]`\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_value = arr[0:k]\nunmoved_value = arr[k:len(arr)]\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = len(arr)\n    while k > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        k -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's analyze the given `insertion_sort` function step-by-step to determine the appropriate loop invariant.\n\n### Function Analysis:\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - `k = len(arr)`: Initialize `k` to the length of the array.\n   \n2. **Outer Loop (`while k > 0`):**\n   - The loop runs while `k` is greater than 0.\n   - `k` is decremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.\n\n3. **Inner Loop (`while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`):**\n   - This loop iterates through the array starting from `z = i`.\n   - It performs swaps to sort the elements in ascending order until `z` reaches the end of the array or the condition `arr[z - 1] <= arr[z]` is met.\n   - `z` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration.\n\n### Identifying the Loop Invariant:\nThe goal is to find a statement that remains true before and after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\n1. **Before the Start of Each Iteration of the Outer Loop:**\n   - The outer loop runs from `k = len(arr)` down to `k = 1`.\n   - After the k-th iteration of the outer loop, the last `len(arr) - k + 1` elements of the array should be sorted in ascending order.\n   - The first `k - 1` elements of the array are not necessarily sorted but remain unchanged from the previous iterations.\n\n### Formulating the Loop Invariant:\n- The invariant should capture the fact that the last `len(arr) - k + 1` elements are sorted.\n- The first `k - 1` elements remain unchanged.\n\nGiven this, the loop invariant can be written as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[len(arr) - k + 1 : len(arr)]`\n- `unchanged_value = arr[0 : len(arr) - k + 1]`\n\nSince the exact function `fun` isn't specified, we can simplify this to:\n- `sorted_value = arr[len(arr) - k + 1 : len(arr)]`\n- `unchanged_value = arr[0 : len(arr) - k + 1]`\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_value = arr[len(arr) - k + 1 : len(arr)]\nunchanged_value = arr[0 : len(arr) - k + 1]\n```"}]
