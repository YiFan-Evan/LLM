The goal is to find the largest element in the subarray `arr[0:r]` and place it at position `r`.\n\n**Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the largest element in the subarray `arr[0:z]` has not been found yet.\n\nFormally:\n- Before the z-th iteration of the inner loop, the maximum value in `arr[0:z]` has not been found yet.\n\n### Combining the Invariants\n\nCombining these two invariants, we can describe the overall behavior of the algorithm:\n\n- Before the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[r:n]` is sorted in descending order.\n- Within the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop finds the largest element in `arr[0:r]` and swaps it with the element at position `r`, ensuring that the subarray `arr[r:n]` remains sorted in descending order.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the above analysis, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\narr[r:n]_value = sorted(arr[r:n], reverse=True)\n```"}]
