We want to ensure that after each iteration of the outer loop, the first `e` elements of the array are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n**Invariant Statement:** \n`sorted_elements_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[e-1])`\n\nThis means that after the `e`-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `e` elements of the array (`arr[0]` to `arr[e-1]`) are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant:\nThe inner loop runs from `z = e + 1` to `z = len(arr) - 1`. This loop is responsible for finding the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the current element `arr[e]`.\n\n**Invariant Statement:**\n`min_element_value = fun(arr[e+1]->arr[z-1])`\n\nThis means that after the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop, the minimum element in the subarray `arr[e+1]` to `arr[z-1]` has been identified and swapped with `arr[e]` if necessary.\n\n### Conclusion:\nFor the outer loop, the invariant can be stated as:\n`sorted_elements_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[e-1])`\n\nFor the inner loop, the invariant can be stated as:\n`min_element_value = fun(arr[e+1]->arr[z-1])`\n\nHowever, since the problem specifically asks for the loop invariant in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can simplify the invariant for the outer loop to:\n\n`sorted_elements_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[e-1])`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n`sorted_elements_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[e-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    e = len(arr)\n    while e > 0:\n        e -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[e]:\n                temp = arr[e]\n                arr[e] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's analyze the provided `selection_sort` function step-by-step to determine the loop invariant.\n\n### Function Analysis:\n1. **Outer Loop**: The loop starts with `e = len(arr)` and decrements `e` until `e > 0`.\n2. **Inner Loop**: For each value of `e`, the inner loop starts with `z = e` and decrements `z` until `z > 0`.\n\n### Outer Loop Invariant:\nThe outer loop iterates backward through the array. After each iteration of the outer loop, the last `len(arr) - e` elements of the array should be sorted in non-increasing order (since the condition `arr[z] < arr[e]` swaps smaller elements with larger ones).\n\n**Invariant Statement:**\n`unsorted_elements_value = fun(arr[e]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\n\nThis means that after the `e`-th iteration of the outer loop, the elements from index `e` to the end of the array (`arr[e]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]`) are sorted in non-increasing order.\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant:\nThe inner loop iterates backward from `z = e` to `z > 0`. During each iteration of the inner loop, we check if `arr[z] < arr[e]` and swap them if true. This ensures that the largest element in the unsorted portion of the array moves towards the beginning of the unsorted portion.\n\n**Invariant Statement:**\n`max_element_value = fun(arr[z+1]->arr[e-1])`\n\nThis means that after the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop, the maximum element in the subarray `arr[z+1]` to `arr[e-1]` is moved to position `e`.\n\n### Simplified Invariant:\nGiven the requirement to express the invariant in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we focus on the outer loop invariant.\n\n**Final Invariant:**\n`unsorted_elements_value = fun(arr[e]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n`unsorted_elements_value = fun(arr[e]->arr[len(arr)-1])`"}]
