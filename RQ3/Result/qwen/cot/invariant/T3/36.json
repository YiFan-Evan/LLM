This means that at the beginning, `min_value` holds the minimum value of the first element of the array.\n\n2. **Loop Execution**: During each iteration of the loop, the variable `q` increments from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`. At each step, the algorithm checks if the current element `arr[q]` is less than `min_value`. If it is, `min_value` is updated to `arr[q]`.\n\n3. **Invariant Condition**: We need to find a condition that remains true throughout the loop iterations.
