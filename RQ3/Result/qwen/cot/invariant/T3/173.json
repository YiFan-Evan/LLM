This means that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `n` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n**Invariant Statement:**\nThe first `n` elements of the array are sorted.\n\nIn terms of the required format, this can be represented as:\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0:n])`\n\nSince the function is to sort the array, we can represent the invariant as:\n`sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:n])`\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant:\nThe inner loop runs while `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`, swapping elements until `arr[z - 1] <= arr[z]`. This ensures that the element at position `z` is placed in its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.\n\n**Invariant Statement:**\nThe subarray from `0` to `z` is sorted, and the element at position `z` is in its correct position relative to the sorted subarray.\n\nIn terms of the required format, this can be represented as:\n`sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:z+1])`\n\n### Conclusion:\nCombining these insights, we can state the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n`sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:n])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        n -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's analyze the provided code step-by-step to identify a suitable loop invariant.\n\n### Code Analysis:\n- The function `insertion_sort` takes an array `arr`.\n- The outer loop starts with `n = len(arr)` and continues while `n > 0`.\n- Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop that starts with `z = i` and continues while `z < len(arr)` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`.\n- Within the inner loop, elements are swapped to ensure the sorted property.\n- After the inner loop completes, `n` is decremented by 1.\n\n### Outer Loop Invariant:\nThe outer loop decreases `n` from the length of the array down to 0. The purpose of the outer loop is to handle the insertion of the element at index `n-1` into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array (from `0` to `n-2`).\n\n**Invariant Statement:**\nAfter the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `len(arr) - n` elements of the array are sorted.\n\nIn terms of the required format, this can be represented as:\n`sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:len(arr)-n])`\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant:\nThe inner loop runs while `z < len(arr)` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`. It swaps elements to place the element at index `z` in its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.\n\n**Invariant Statement:**\nAfter the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray from `0` to `z` is sorted.\n\nIn terms of the required format, this can be represented as:\n`sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:z+1])`\n\n### Conclusion:\nCombining these insights, we can state the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n`sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:len(arr)-n])`"}]
