Let's break down the code and analyze it step by step.\n\n### Code Analysis\n\nThe `insertion_sort` function sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm. The outer loop iterates over the array from index 0 to `len(arr) - 1`. For each element at index `t`, the inner loop shifts elements to the right until the correct position for `arr[t]` is found.\n\n#### Outer Loop\n- **Invariant Condition**: Before the `t`-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:t]` is sorted.\n- **Initialization**: At the start of the first iteration (`t = 0`), the subarray `arr[0:0]` is trivially sorted (since it contains no elements).\n- **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop ensures that `arr[t]` is inserted into its correct position within the already sorted subarray `arr[0:t-1]`.\n- **Termination**: When the outer loop completes, `t` reaches `len(arr)`, and the entire array `arr[0:len(arr)]` is sorted.\n\n#### Inner Loop\n- **Invariant Condition**: Before the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[z:t+1]` is partially sorted such that `arr[z]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `arr[z+1:t+1]`.\n- **Initialization**: At the start of the first iteration of the inner loop (`z = t`), the subarray `arr[t:t+1]` is trivially sorted.\n- **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the inner loop, if `arr[z-1] > arr[z]`, the elements are swapped to ensure that `arr[z-1] <= arr[z]`.\n- **Termination**: When the inner loop completes, `z` reaches 0, and the subarray `arr[0:t+1]` is fully sorted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the above analysis, we can formulate the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop as follows:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: Before the `t`-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:t]` is sorted.\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: Before the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[z:t+1]` is partially sorted such that `arr[z]` is greater than or equal to all elements in `arr[z+1:t+1]`.\n\nSince the outer loop invariant is the primary focus, we can express it in the required format:\n\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr[0:t]_value = fun(arr[0:t])\n```\n\nWhere `fun(arr[0:t])` represents the property that the subarray `arr[0:t]` is sorted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    t = -1\n    while t < len(arr) - 1:\n        t += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find a loop invariant for the provided insertion sort algorithm, let's break down the code and understand its behavior.\n\n### Code Analysis\n\nThe function `insertion_sort` sorts an array using the insertion sort technique.
