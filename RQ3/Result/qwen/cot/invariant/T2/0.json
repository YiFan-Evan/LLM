[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

At this point, `max_value` contains the maximum value found in the subarray from index `0` to `0`.\n\n2. **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the loop, the variable `a` increments from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`. At each step, if `arr[a]` is greater than `max_value`, then `max_value` is updated to `arr[a]`. This ensures that `max_value` always holds the maximum value found so far in the subarray from index `0` to `a`.\n\n3. **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `a` equals `len(arr)`, meaning all elements in the array have been checked.
