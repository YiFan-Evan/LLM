[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This is because:\n- Initially, `k` is -1, so `sum_value` is 0 (no elements summed).\n- With each iteration, `k` increments by 1, and the corresponding element `arr[k]` is added to `sum_value`.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n- `sum_value = sum(arr[0:k+1])`\n\nRewriting this invariant in the required format:\n- `sum_value = sum(arr[0:k+1])`\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sum_value = sum(arr[0:k+1])`"}]
