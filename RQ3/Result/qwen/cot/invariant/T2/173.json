It has two nested loops:\n1. The outer loop iterates over the indices of the array from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.\n2. The inner loop ensures that the elements before the current index `n` are sorted correctly.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\nWe need to identify a condition that holds true at the start of each iteration of the outer loop.\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant:\nAt the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop (i.e., when `n == i`), the first `i` elements of the array (`arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`) are sorted.\n\n### Formalizing the Invariant:\nThe loop invariant can be stated as:\n- **First i elements are sorted**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:i])`\n\n### Explanation:\n- At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the first `i` elements of the array are guaranteed to be sorted.\n- This invariant holds because the inner loop ensures that each element `arr[j]` for `j < i` is in its correct position relative to the other elements before it.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0:n])\n``` \n\nThis invariant helps in proving the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm by ensuring that the first `n` elements are sorted at the start of each iteration of the outer loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given `insertion_sort` function, let's break down the code and analyze its behavior.\n\n### Code Analysis:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `n = -1`: This initializes `n` to `-1`, which means the outer loop starts with `n = 0`.\n\n2. **Outer Loop**:\n   - `while n < len(arr) - 1`: This loop runs until `n` reaches `len(arr) - 1`.\n   - `n += 1`: This increments `n` by 1 at the beginning of each iteration.\n\n3. **Inner Loop**:\n   - `z = i`: This sets `z` to `i`.
