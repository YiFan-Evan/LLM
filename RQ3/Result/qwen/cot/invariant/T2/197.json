The purpose of this loop is to place the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array into its correct position. \n\nBefore the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\n- The first `r` elements are sorted in ascending order.\n- The remaining `len(arr) - r` elements are unsorted.\n\n**Invariant:** After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `r` elements are the smallest `r` elements of the array in sorted order.\n\nFormally, we can state this as:\n- `arr[0:r]` contains the smallest `r` elements of `arr` in sorted order.\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant\nThe inner loop runs from `z = r + 1` to `z < len(arr)`. This loop finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the current element at index `r`.\n\nBefore the j-th iteration of the inner loop:\n- The elements from `arr[r+1]` to `arr[z-1]` have been checked.\n- The element at `arr[r]` is the smallest element found so far in the unsorted portion.\n\n**Invariant:** After the j-th iteration of the inner loop, the element at `arr[r]` is the smallest element in the subarray `arr[r+1:z]`.\n\nFormally, we can state this as:\n- `arr[r]` is the smallest element in `arr[r+1:z]`.\n\n### Conclusion\nCombining these invariants, we can describe the behavior of the loops as follows:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant:** `arr[0:r]` contains the smallest `r` elements of `arr` in sorted order.\n- **Inner Loop Invariant:** `arr[r]` is the smallest element in `arr[r+1:z]`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- Outer Loop Invariant: `arr[0:r]_value = sorted_smallest(r)`\n- Inner Loop Invariant: `arr[r]_value = min(arr[r+1:z])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        z = r + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[r]:\n                temp = arr[r]\n                arr[r] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given `selection_sort` function, we need to analyze the behavior of the loops and ensure that the conditions hold true before and after each iteration.\n\n### Outer Loop Analysis\nThe outer loop starts with `r = -1` and increments `r` until `r < len(arr) - 1`. This means the loop runs `len(arr)` times, ensuring each element is considered as the starting point for finding the minimum in the unsorted portion of the array.\n\nBefore the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\n- The first `r` elements are not necessarily sorted.\n- The remaining `len(arr) - r` elements are unsorted.\n\n**Invariant:** After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the element at index `r` is the smallest element in the subarray `arr[r:len(arr)]`.\n\nFormally, we can state this as:\n- `arr[r]` is the smallest element in `arr[r:len(arr)]`.\n\n### Inner Loop Analysis\nThe inner loop starts with `z = r + 1` and increments `z` until `z < len(arr)`.
