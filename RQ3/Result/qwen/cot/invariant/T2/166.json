Since `z` starts from `i` and decreases until the condition fails, the subarray `arr[0...i]` will be sorted after the inner loop completes.\n\nThus, a suitable loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n**\"The subarray arr[0...z] is sorted in non-decreasing order.\"**\n\nRewriting this in the required format:\n\n**\"arr[0...z]_value = sorted(arr[0...z])\"**\n\nHowever, since we need to use the given format exactly:\n\n**\"arr[0...z]_value = fun(arr[0...z])\"**\n\nWe can define the function `fun` such that it returns the sorted version of the subarray `arr[0...z]`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**\"arr[0...z]_value = sorted(arr[0...z])\"**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = -1\n    while g < len(arr) - 1:\n        g += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine a suitable loop invariant for the provided `insertion_sort` function, let's analyze the behavior of the loops and what needs to be proven about the array at each step.\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Outer Loop (`g`)**:\n   - The outer loop runs from `g = -1` to `g < len(arr) - 1`.\n   - After each iteration of the outer loop, `g` increments by 1, meaning the first `g + 1` elements of the array are being processed.\n\n2. **Inner Loop (`z`)**:\n   - The inner loop runs as long as `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`.\n   - This loop ensures that the subarray `arr[0...g]` is sorted by shifting elements to their correct positions.\n\n3. **Loop Invariant**:\n   - We need to show that after the completion of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0...g]` is sorted.\n   - Therefore, a suitable loop invariant for the inner loop would be that the subarray `arr[0...g]` is sorted.\n\nGiven the requirement to express the loop invariant in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can state the invariant as:\n\n**\"arr[0...g]_value = sorted(arr[0...g])\"**\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n**\"arr[0...g]_value = sorted(arr[0...g])\"**"}]
