The outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `len(arr) - 1`.\n   - After each iteration of the outer loop, the first `i` elements of the array are sorted.\n   - Therefore, the invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n     ```\n     sorted_value = fun(arr[0:i])\n     ```\n\n2. **Inner Loop Invariant**:\n   - The inner loop runs from `z = i + 1` to `len(arr) - 1`.\n   - The goal of the inner loop is to find the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array (`arr[i+1:len(arr)]`) and swap it with the element at index `i` if it is smaller.\n   - After each iteration of the inner loop, the smallest element among `arr[i+1:z+1]` is swapped into position `i` if it is smaller than `arr[i]`.\n   - Therefore, the invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n     ```\n     min_value = fun(arr[i+1:z+1])\n     ```\n\n### Combining Invariants:\n- For the outer loop, we need to ensure that the first `i` elements are sorted.\n- For the inner loop, we need to ensure that the smallest element among `arr[i+1:z+1]` is correctly placed in the sorted portion of the array.\n\nGiven these considerations, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be formulated as:\n\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0:i])\n```\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be formulated as:\n\n```\nmin_value = fun(arr[i+1:z+1])\n```\n\nHowever, since we are asked to provide the invariant in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we need to combine these invariants into a single statement that captures the essence of the sorting process.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0:i]->arr[i-1])\n``` \n\nThis invariant ensures that the first `i` elements of the array are sorted after each iteration of the outer loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) -
