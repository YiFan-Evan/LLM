The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The goal of the loop is to find the maximum value in the array `arr`.\n\n### Thought Process:\n\n1. **Initialization**: At the beginning of the first iteration, `max_value` is set to `arr[0]`. This means that `max_value` holds the maximum value of the elements seen so far, which initially is just `arr[0]`.\n\n2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `n < len(arr)`.
