During each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop performs a series of swaps to insert the element at index `e` into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.\n\nLet's break down the behavior of the algorithm:\n\n1. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over each element in the array.\n2. **Inner Loop**: For each element at index `e`, it compares it with the previous elements and swaps them if necessary to ensure that the subarray from index `0` to `e` is sorted.\n\nGiven this behavior, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as follows:\n\n- After the `i-th` iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:i+1]` is sorted.\n\nHowever, the provided code has a variable `z` initialized to `i`, which seems incorrect because `i` is not defined in the scope of the function. Instead, we should consider the variable `e` which correctly tracks the current element being processed.\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the outer loop should be:\n- After the `e-th` iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:e]` is sorted.\n\nFormally, we can write the loop invariant in the required format:\n\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:e])`\n\nSince the invariant states that the subarray `arr[0:e]` is sorted, we can formalize this as:\n\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:e])`\n\nHowever, since we are asked to use the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can rephrase it as:\n\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:e]->arr[0:e])`\n\nBut since the exact sorting function isn't needed, we can simplify it to indicate that the subarray is sorted up to the current element:\n\n- `sorted_value = True if arr[0:e] is sorted else False`\n\nGiven the context, we can simplify further to just indicate the sorted part:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:e]`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:e]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = -1\n    while e < len(arr) - 1:\n        e += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given insertion sort algorithm, let's analyze the purpose and behavior of the loops.\n\n### Outer Loop\nThe outer loop starts with `e = -1` and increments `e` until `e < len(arr) - 1`. This means that `e` iterates from `-1` to `len(arr) - 2`.\n\n### Inner Loop\nThe inner loop starts with `z = i` (which should be `z = e` based on typical insertion sort logic) and decrements `z` as long as `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`. This loop ensures that the element at `arr[e]` is inserted into its correct position in the already sorted portion of the array (`arr[0:e]`).\n\n### Invariant Analysis\nWe need to identify a property that holds true before and after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\n1. **Before the first iteration**:\n   - The subarray `arr[0:e]` is empty (since `e = -1`), which is trivially sorted.\n\n2. **After each iteration**:\n   - The subarray `arr[0:e]` is sorted, and the element `arr[e]` is in its correct position within the sorted subarray.\n\nGiven this, we can formulate the loop invariant for the outer loop as:\n- After the `i-th` iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:e]` is sorted.\n\nSince `e` represents the current boundary of the sorted subarray, we can express this invariant as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:e]`\n\nThis indicates that the subarray from index `0` to `e` is sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:e]`"}]
