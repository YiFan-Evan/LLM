This means that at the end of each iteration of the outer loop, the smallest element in the subarray `arr[q:len(arr)]` will be in position `q`.\n\nSo, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- Before the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:q]` contains the smallest `q` elements of the array in sorted order.\n- After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:q]` contains the smallest `q` elements of the array in sorted order.\n\nWe can write this invariant as:\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0:q])\n```\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant:\nThe inner loop runs from `z = q + 1` to `z < len(arr)`.
