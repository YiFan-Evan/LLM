So we can rephrase it slightly to fit the format:\n\n```\narr[0:c]_value = sorted(arr[0:c])\n```\n\nSince the format requires a specific function, we can use a placeholder function like `sorted()` to indicate that the subarray is sorted:\n\n```\narr[0:c]_value = sorted(arr[0:c])\n```\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\n\n```\narr[0:c]_value = sorted(arr[0:c])\n```\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\narr[0:c]_value = sorted(arr[0:c])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    c = -1\n    while c < len(arr) - 1:\n        c += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given insertion sort algorithm, we need to analyze the behavior of the loops and how they maintain the order of elements in the array.\n\n### Outer Loop Analysis:\nThe outer loop starts with `c = -1` and runs until `c < len(arr) - 1`.
