The outer loop should use an index that tracks the end of the sorted portion of the array.\n\nLet's rewrite the code with these corrections:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for d in range(1, len(arr)):\n        current_value = arr[d]\n        position = d\n\n        # Move elements of arr[0..d-1], that are greater than current_value,\n        # to one position ahead of their current position\n        while position > 0 and arr[position - 1] > current_value:\n            arr[position] = arr[position - 1]\n            position -= 1\n\n        arr[position] = current_value\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant Analysis\n\n**Outer Loop (for d in range(1, len(arr))):**\n- The outer loop runs from `d = 1` to `len(arr) - 1`.\n- After the `d`-th iteration, the first `d` elements of the array (`arr[0]` to `arr[d-1]`) are sorted.\n\n**Inner Loop (while position > 0 and arr[position - 1] > current_value):**\n- The inner loop runs as long as the element at `position` is less than the element at `position - 1`.\n- During the `d`-th iteration of the outer loop, the element `arr[d]` is inserted into the correct position within the already sorted portion (`arr[0]` to `arr[d-1]`).\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the `d`-th iteration of the outer loop, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\n\n**Invariant for the Outer Loop:**\n- The subarray `arr[0:d]` is sorted after the `d`-th iteration.\n\nFormally, this can be written as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:d] -> arr[0:d])`\n- Here, `fun` represents the property that the subarray `arr[0:d]` is sorted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:d] -> arr[0:d])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = -1\n    while d < len(arr) - 1:\n        d += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given insertion sort algorithm, we need to analyze the structure and behavior of the loops.
