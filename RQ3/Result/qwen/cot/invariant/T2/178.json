This is an unusual initialization but it helps us to think about the loop invariant clearly.\n\n2. **Outer Loop (`while s < len(arr) - 1`)**:\n   - This loop iterates over each element in the array starting from index 0 up to the second last element.\n   - The variable `s` represents the current position in the array that needs to be sorted into its correct place within the already sorted portion of the array.\n\n3. **Incrementing `s`**:\n   - Inside the loop, `s` is incremented by 1 at the beginning of each iteration, effectively moving to the next element in the array.\n\n4. **Inner Loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`)**:\n   - This loop ensures that the elements from the start of the array up to the current position `s` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n   - The variable `z` starts at the current position `s` and moves backward until it finds the correct position for `arr[s]` within the sorted portion of the array.\n\n### Identifying the Loop Invariant\n\nWe need to identify a statement that holds true before and after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n- After each iteration of the outer loop, the first `s+1` elements of the array are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n  - `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:s+1])`\n\nGiven the nature of insertion sort, we know that after each iteration of the outer loop, the first `s+1` elements of the array are sorted.
