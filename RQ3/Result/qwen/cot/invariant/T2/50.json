The subarray `arr[0:k+1]` is empty, so `count_value` correctly reflects that no elements have been checked yet.\n- **Loop Iteration**: At each iteration, `k` increments by 1, and `count_value` is updated based on whether `arr[k]` matches `target`.\n\nTo express this invariant, we need to ensure that `count_value` accurately reflects the number of occurrences of `target` in the subarray `arr[0:k]`.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\n\nThe loop invariant can be stated as:\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[0:k] if x == target)`\n\nThis means that `count_value` is the sum of 1s for every element in the subarray from index 0 to `k-1` (inclusive) that matches the `target`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be expressed as:\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[0:k] if x == target)`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[0:k] if x == target)`"}]
