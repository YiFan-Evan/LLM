This means no elements have been considered as sorted yet.\n\n2. **Loop Condition**:\n   - The loop continues as long as `g < len(arr) - 1`. This means the loop runs until all but the last element has been processed.\n\n3. **Loop Body**:\n   - For each iteration of the outer loop, `g` is incremented by 1.\n   - For each value of `g`, the inner loop finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array (`arr[g+1]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]`) and swaps it with `arr[g]` if necessary.\n\n### Inner Loop Analysis\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `z` starts at `g + 1`.\n\n2. **Loop Condition**:\n   - The inner loop continues as long as `z < len(arr)`.\n\n3. **Loop Body**:\n   - For each iteration of the inner loop, `z` is incremented by 1.\n   - During each iteration, the algorithm checks if `arr[z] < arr[g]`. If true, it swaps `arr[g]` and `arr[z]`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nWe need to find an invariant that holds before and after each iteration of the outer loop. Based on the analysis, the invariant should reflect that the first `g` elements of the array are sorted and are the smallest `g` elements of the array.\n\nFormally, we can express this invariant as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g])`\n\nThis means that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[g]` contains the smallest `g+1` elements of the array in sorted order.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g])`"}]
