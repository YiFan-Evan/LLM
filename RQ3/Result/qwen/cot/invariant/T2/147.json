[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The goal of the loop is to accumulate the sum of all elements in the array `arr` into the variable `sum_value`.\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `sum_value` is initialized to 0.\n2. **Maintenance**: During each iteration, `sum_value` is updated by adding the current element `arr[h]`.\n3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `h` equals the length of `arr`.

This ensures that the loop iterates over all elements of the array `arr` except the last one.\n\n3. **Loop Body**:\n   - In each iteration, `h` is incremented by `1`, and `sum_value` is updated by adding `arr[h]` to it.\n\n4. **Loop Invariant**:\n   - We need to find a statement that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. A good candidate would be something that describes the relationship between `sum_value` and the elements of the array up to the current index `h`.\n\nConsidering the above points, the loop invariant should describe that `sum_value` is the sum of the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[h]` before each iteration.\n\nFormally, this can be stated as:\n- `sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[h])`\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[h])`"}]
