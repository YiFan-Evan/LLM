The outer loop iterates over each element of the array, starting from the first element up to the last one. The inner loop performs the actual sorting by shifting elements that are greater than the current element to the right.\n\nTo determine a loop invariant, we need to identify a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner loop. \n\nThe key observation here is that the inner loop ensures that all elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are sorted in non-decreasing order. This is because the inner loop shifts elements to the right until the current element (`arr[i]`) is in its correct position within the already sorted part of the array.\n\nGiven this, we can formulate the loop invariant as follows:\n\n- Before the inner loop starts, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` is sorted.\n- During each iteration of the inner loop, this property is maintained.\n- After the inner loop finishes, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` is sorted.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can express the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop as:\n\n\"Before the inner loop starts, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` is sorted.\"\n\nFormulating this in the required format, we get:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = arr[0:i-1]`\n\nHowever, since we need to express it in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can refine it to:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = arr[0:i-1]` (which implies the sorted part of the array from index 0 to i-1).\n\nBut to strictly adhere to the format provided:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = arr[0:i]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        j += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Thought Process\n\nThe given code is an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.
