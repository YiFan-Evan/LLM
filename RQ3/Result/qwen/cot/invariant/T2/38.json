[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

At this point, we can say that `min_value` holds the minimum value of the subarray from `arr[0]` to `arr[0]`.\n\n2. **Loop Iteration**: During each iteration of the loop, the index `s` is incremented from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.
