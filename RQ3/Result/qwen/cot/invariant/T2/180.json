This loop runs from `a = 0` to `a = len(arr) - 1`.\n   - In each iteration of this loop, the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array (i.e., from index `a` to the end) is moved to position `a`.\n\n2. **Inner Loop (`while z < len(arr)`)**:\n   - This loop runs from `z = a + 1` to `z = len(arr) - 1`.\n   - It compares elements starting from `a + 1` to find the minimum element in the unsorted part.\n   - If an element is found to be smaller than the element at `arr[a]`, it swaps them.\n\n3. **Post-Condition**:\n   -
