Specifically, the variable `i` is not defined in the code snippet provided. Assuming `i` is intended to be the outer loop index, we'll proceed by considering the outer loop and the inner loop separately.\n\n### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nThe outer loop iterates over the array, starting from index 0 and moving towards the end of the array.

Inside this outer loop, another inner loop is used to insert the element at index `h` into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.\n\nHowever, there is an issue in the code: the variable `i` is not defined.
