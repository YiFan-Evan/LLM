The outer loop runs from `b = -1` to `b < len(arr) - 1`, incrementing `b` at each iteration. The inner loop ensures that elements within the subarray `arr[0:b+1]` are sorted correctly.\n\n### Outer Loop Analysis\n- **Initialization**: `b = -1`\n- **Condition**: `b < len(arr) - 1`\n- **Increment**: `b += 1`\n\nAfter each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:b+1]` should be sorted.\n\n### Inner Loop Analysis\n- **Condition**: `z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`\n- **Adjustment**: Swap elements `arr[z]` and `arr[z - 1]` until the condition fails.\n\nThe inner loop ensures that the elements in the subarray `arr[0:b+1]` are sorted correctly by moving the current element `arr[b]` into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.\n\n### Formulating the Loop Invariant\nGiven the above analysis, we need to formulate a loop invariant that holds true after each iteration of the outer loop. Specifically, we want to state that the first `b+1` elements of the array are sorted.\n\nWe can express this as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:b+1]`\n\n### Conclusion\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:b+1]`"}]
