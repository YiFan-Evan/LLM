[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This means that at the start of the loop, `max_value` holds the maximum value found among the elements processed so far, which is just the first element initially.\n   \n2. **Maintenance**: During each iteration, the loop checks whether the current element `arr[m]` is greater than the current `max_value`.
