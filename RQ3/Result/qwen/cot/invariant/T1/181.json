After each iteration of the outer loop, the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array (from index `b` to the end) will be placed at position `b`.\n\n**Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop:**\n- Before the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `b` elements are sorted and in their correct positions.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n  ```\n  sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[b-1])\n  ```\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant:\nThe inner loop runs from `z = b + 1` to `z = len(arr) - 1`. During this loop, it finds the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array starting from `b` and swaps it with the element at position `b` if necessary.\n\n**Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop:**\n- Before the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray from `b` to `z-1` contains the smallest element found so far.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n  ```\n  min_value = fun(arr[b]->arr[z-1])\n  ```\n\n### Conclusion:\nCombining these insights, we can formulate the loop invariants for both loops:\n\n- For the outer loop:\n  ```\n  sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[b-1])\n  ```\n\n- For the inner loop:\n  ```\n  min_value = fun(arr[b]->arr[z-1])\n  ```\n\nSince the question asks for a single invariant per loop, we can choose one of them based on the context of the problem.
