This means that initially, `min_value` is the smallest value seen so far, but it's only been compared with one element.\n   \n2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `o` is less than the length of the array. This means that during each iteration, the current index `o` is being checked against the current minimum value (`min_value`).\n\n3. **Update Rule**: Inside the loop, if the current element (`arr[o]`) is smaller than the current `min_value`, then `min_value` is updated to this new smaller value.
