[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This invariant should help us understand why the algorithm correctly finds the minimum value in the array.\n\n### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Before the loop starts, `min_value` is set to `arr[0]`. At this point, `min_value` is the minimum value of the subarray `arr[0:0]`, which is trivially true since it's just the first element.\n\n2. **Loop Condition**:\n   - The loop runs as long as `a < len(arr)`. This means that during the i-th iteration, `a` ranges from `0` to `i-1`.\n\n3. **Loop Invariant Candidate**:\n   - We want to ensure that at any point during the loop, `min_value` holds the minimum value of the subarray `arr[0:a]`.\n   - If `arr[a] < min_value`, then `min_value` is updated to `arr[a]`.\n\n4. **Formulating the Invariant**:\n   - Let\u2019s formulate the invariant as `min_value = min(arr[0:a+1])`.\n\n5. **Verification**:\n   - **Initialization**: Initially, `a = 0`, so `min_value = arr[0]`, which is indeed the minimum of `arr[0:1]`.\n   - **Maintenance**: During each iteration, if `arr[a] < min_value`, `min_value` is updated to `arr[a]`.
