The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If the index `id` is out of bounds, it returns `-1`.\n\n2. **Loop Variable**: The variable `s` is used as an index to traverse through the array `arr`.\n\n3. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs while `s` is less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`. This means the loop iterates from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.\n\n4. **Invariant Candidate**: We need a statement that captures the state of the `member_value` at any point during the loop execution.

Otherwise, `member_value` remains unchanged.\n- **After the Loop**: Once the loop completes, `member_value` will either be the value at `arr[id]` if `id` is within bounds, or `-1` if `id` is out of bounds.\n\nThus, the invariant should capture that `member_value` is correctly set based on the elements processed so far.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[s-1])`"}]
