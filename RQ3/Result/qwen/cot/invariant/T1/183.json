If `arr[z]` is smaller, it swaps them.\n- This ensures that after the inner loop completes, the smallest element in the range `[d+1, len(arr)-1]` is moved to index `d`.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\nWe need to find a statement that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner loop. Specifically, we want to ensure that the elements up to index `d` are sorted and contain the smallest elements found so far.\n\nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be expressed as:\n- `arr[0:d+1]` contains the `d+1` smallest elements in sorted order.\n\nHowever, to match the required format, we can express it as:\n- `sorted_elements_value = arr[0:d+1]`\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_elements_value = arr[0:d+1]\n```"}]
