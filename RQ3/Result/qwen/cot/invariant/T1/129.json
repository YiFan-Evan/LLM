The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This means initially, `mid_value` holds the first element of the array.\n\n2. **Loop Condition**:\n   - The loop continues as long as `2 * j < len(arr)`. This implies the loop runs until `j` reaches half the length of the array.\n\n3. **Loop Body**:\n   - Inside the loop, `mid_value` is updated to `arr[j]`.\n   - After updating `mid_value`, `j` is incremented by 1.\n\n4. **Post-loop State**:\n   - When the loop ends, `j` would have reached a value such that `2 * j >= len(arr)`, meaning `j` is at least half the length of the array.\n   - At this point, `mid_value` contains the last element that was assigned during the loop iterations.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\nA loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.
