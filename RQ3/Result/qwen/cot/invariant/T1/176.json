The key observation is that after the outer loop has run up to `q`, the first `q` elements of the array (`arr[0]` to `arr[q-1]`) are sorted.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])`\n\nThis means that the subarray from index `0` to `q-1` is sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])\n```"}]
