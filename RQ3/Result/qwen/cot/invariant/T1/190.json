This means that after `k` iterations, the first `k` elements are in their correct positions relative to each other.\n\n**Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop:**\n\nThe first `k` elements are the smallest `k` elements in the array and are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nFormally, this can be stated as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[:k]`\n- `smallest_k_value = sorted(arr[:k])`\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be written as:\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[:k])`\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nNow let's consider the inner loop:\n\n```python\nwhile z < len(arr):\n```\n\nAt the start of the j-th iteration of the inner loop, the element `arr[k]` is assumed to be the smallest element in the subarray `arr[k+1:]`. The inner loop searches for the smallest element in the subarray `arr[k+1:]` and swaps it with `arr[k]` if necessary.\n\n**Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop:**\n\nThe element `arr[k]` is the smallest element in the subarray `arr[k:z]`.\n\nFormally, this can be stated as:\n- `min_value = min(arr[k:z+1])`\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be written as:\n- `min_value = min(arr[k:z+1])`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining both loop invariants, we get the following loop invariants for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = sorted(arr[:k])`\n- For the inner loop: `min_value = min(arr[k:z+1])`\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the loop invariant in the specific format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can use the invariant for the inner loop:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `min_value = min(arr[k:z+1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    k = 0\n    while k <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = k + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[k]:\n                temp = arr[k]\n                arr[k] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        k += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the `selection_sort` function, we need to identify what remains true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nThe outer loop iterates from `k = 0` to `k = len(arr) - 1`.
