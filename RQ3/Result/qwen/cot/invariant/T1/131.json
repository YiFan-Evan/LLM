Therefore, the loop invariant should reflect that `mid_value` is the value of the element at index `l` up to the midpoint of the array.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be formulated as:\n\n- `mid_value = arr[min(l, len(arr) // 2)]`\n- `l = current_index`\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the above analysis, we can conclude the loop invariant as follows:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nmid_value = arr[min(l, len(arr) // 2)]\n```"}]
