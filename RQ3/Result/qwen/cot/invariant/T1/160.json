The outer loop runs from `a = 0` to `a < len(arr)`. For each value of `a`, there is an inner loop that performs the insertion operation on the sorted subarray up to index `a`.\n\n### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nThe outer loop iterates over the array indices starting from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`. At the end of the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `a + 1` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n**Loop Invariant for the outer loop:**\n\n- **Invariant:** After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `a + 1` elements of the array are sorted.\n- **Form:** We can express this as `sorted_value = True` where `sorted_value` is true if the first `a + 1` elements are sorted.\n\nHowever, since we need to use the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can rephrase it as:\n\n- **Invariant:** `sorted_value = all(arr[j] <= arr[j+1] for j in range(a))`\n- **Form:** `sorted_value = all(arr[j] <= arr[j+1] for j in range(a))`\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nThe inner loop starts at `z = a` and moves backwards until `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`. This loop ensures that the element at index `a` is inserted into the correct position within the sorted subarray up to `a - 1`.\n\n**Loop Invariant for the inner loop:**\n\n- **Invariant:** At the start of the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0:a]` is sorted, and the element at index `a` is temporarily placed in `arr[a]`.\n- **Form:** We can express this as `sorted_subarray_value = all(arr[j] <= arr[j+1] for j in range(a))`\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining both invariants, we get:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant:** `sorted_value = all(arr[j] <= arr[j+1] for j in range(a))`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant:** `sorted_subarray_value = all(arr[j] <= arr[j+1] for j in range(a))`\n\nSince the invariants are essentially the same for both loops, we can simplify our final answer to reflect the sorted property of the array up to the current index `a`.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: sorted_value = all(arr[j] <= arr[j+1] for j in range(a))\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    a = 0\n    while a <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        a += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given insertion sort algorithm, let's break down the code and understand what happens during each iteration of the loops.\n\n### Function Analysis\n\nThe function `insertion_sort` sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm.
