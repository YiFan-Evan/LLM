[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This invariant should help us understand why the function correctly returns the value at the specified index.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Before the loop starts, `member_value` is initialized to `-1`. This value will be used to indicate that no valid member has been found yet.\n   - `d` is initialized to `0`.\n\n2. **Loop Condition**:\n   - The loop runs as long as `d` is less than the length of the array `arr`.\n\n3. **Loop Body**:\n   - Inside the loop, there is a conditional check `if d == id:`. If this condition is met, it means the current index `d` matches the provided `id`.\n   - When the condition is true, the value at `arr[d]` is assigned to `member_value`.\n\n4. **Post-Condition**:\n   - After the loop ends, `member_value` should hold the value at the index `id` if `id` is within the bounds of the array.
