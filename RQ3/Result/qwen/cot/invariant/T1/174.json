The outer while loop runs until `o` reaches the length of the array. Inside this loop, there is another while loop that performs the actual sorting by comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Outer Loop (o loop):**\n   - The outer loop runs from `o = 0` to `o < len(arr)`.\n   - The variable `z` starts at `i`, which seems to be undefined in the context of the loop. Assuming `i` is meant to be `o`, we can rewrite the loop initialization as `z = o`.\n\n2. **Inner Loop (z loop):**\n   - The inner loop runs while `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`.\n   - This loop shifts elements to the right until it finds the correct position for `arr[z]`.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\nWe need to find a property that holds true before and after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\nLet's consider the array up to index `o-1` (the part of the array that has been sorted so far). After the outer loop completes its i-th iteration, the first `o` elements of the array should be sorted.\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as:\n- The subarray `arr[0] -> arr[o-1]` is sorted.\n\nGiven the structure of the loop, we can express this invariant as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[o-1])`\n\nSince the subarray `arr[0] -> arr[o-1]` is sorted, we can represent this as:\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[o-1])`\n\nHowever, since we are asked to provide the invariant in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can rephrase it as:\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[o-1])`\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[o-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = 0\n    while o <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        o += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given `insertion_sort` function, let's analyze the code step-by-step.\n\n### Code Breakdown:\n1. **Outer Loop (`while o <= len(arr) - 1`):**\n   - This loop runs from `o = 0` to `o <= len(arr) - 1`.\n   - The variable `z` starts at `i`, which seems to be undefined in the context of the loop.
