[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The goal of this function is to find the maximum value in an array.\n\n### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `max_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`. At this point, `max_value` holds the maximum value of the subarray from `arr[0]` to `arr[0]`.\n\n2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `e` is less than the length of the array (`len(arr)`).\n\n3. **Loop Body**: Inside the loop, the current element `arr[e]` is compared with `max_value`. If `arr[e]` is greater than `max_value`, then `max_value` is updated to `arr[e]`.\n\n4. **Loop Invariant Candidate**: We need a statement that describes the relationship between the elements processed so far and the value of `max_value`.
