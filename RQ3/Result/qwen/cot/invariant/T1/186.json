During each iteration of this loop, the smallest element in the subarray `arr[g:len(arr)]` is placed at position `g`.\n\nLet's denote:\n- `arr[0:g]` as the sorted part of the array.\n- `arr[g:len(arr)]` as the unsorted part of the array.\n\n#### Loop Invariant Statement:\nThe loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n```python\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0:g])\n```\n\nTo formalize this, we need to define what `fun` does. Since `arr[0:g]` is the sorted part of the array, we can say that `fun` returns the sorted values up to index `g`. \n\nHowever, since the loop invariant should be a simple expression involving the array elements, we can state it more concretely as:\n```python\nsorted_value = True\nfor i in range(g):\n    for j in range(i+1, g):\n        if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n            sorted_value = False\n```\n\nBut this is a bit complex. Instead, we can simply state that the first `g` elements are sorted and correctly positioned relative to each other:\n```python\nsorted_value = all(arr[i] <= arr[j] for i in range(g) for j in range(i+1, g))\n```\n\nHowever, a simpler and more direct way to express this is:\n```python\nsorted_value = all(arr[i] <= arr[j] for i in range(g) for j in range(i+1, g))\n```\n\nSince we want to keep it simple and follow the exact format requested:\n```python\nsorted_value = True\nfor i in range(g):\n    for j in range(i+1, g):\n        if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n            sorted_value = False\n```\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nThe inner loop runs from `z = g + 1` to `z < len(arr)`. During each iteration of this loop, the algorithm finds the minimum element in the subarray `arr[g+1:len(arr)]` and swaps it with `arr[g]` if necessary.\n\nLet's denote:\n- `arr[g+1:z]` as the part of the unsorted subarray that has been examined so far.\n\n#### Loop Invariant Statement:\nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n```python\nmin_value = min(arr[g+1:z])\n```\n\nThis means that after the inner loop completes, the smallest element in the subarray `arr[g+1:z]` is known, and if it is smaller than `arr[g]`, it will be swapped.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining both invariants, we have:\n\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = all(arr[i] <= arr[j] for i in range(g) for j in range(i+1, g))`\n- For the inner loop: `min_value = min(arr[g+1:z])`\n\nHowever, following the exact format requested:\n\n```python\nsorted_value = True\nfor i in range(g):\n    for j in range(i+1, g):\n        if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n            sorted_value = False\n```\n\nand for the inner loop:\n\n```python\nmin_value = min(arr[g+1:z])\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```python\nsorted_value = True\nfor i in range(g):\n    for j in range(i+1, g):\n        if arr[i] > arr[j]:\n            sorted_value = False\n```\n\nThis loop invariant ensures that the first `g` elements are sorted and correctly positioned, and the inner loop ensures that the smallest element in the unsorted part is moved to the correct position."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    g = 0\n    while g <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = g + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[g]:\n                temp = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        g += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given `selection_sort` function, we need to analyze the behavior of the algorithm during each iteration of the outer loop.\n\n### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nThe outer loop runs from `g = 0` to `g <= len(arr) - 1`.
