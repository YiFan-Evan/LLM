[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This invariant should help us prove the correctness of the algorithm.\n\n### Step-by-Step Thought Process:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Before the loop starts, `min_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`. This means that at the beginning of the loop, `min_value` contains the minimum value of the subarray from index 0 to 0.\n\n2. **Loop Condition**:\n   - The loop runs as long as `h < len(arr)`. This means that the loop iterates over all elements of the array from index 0 to `len(arr) - 1`.\n\n3. **Loop Body**:\n   - Inside the loop, if `arr[h] < min_value`, then `min_value` is updated to `arr[h]`.\n   - After each iteration, `h` is incremented by 1.\n\n4. **Invariant Hypothesis**:\n   - We need to find a statement that remains true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n   - Given the loop's behavior, a suitable invariant could be related to the current position `h` and the minimum value found so far.\n\n### Proposed Loop Invariant:\n\nThe loop invariant should reflect that up to the current index `h`, `min_value` contains the smallest element encountered so far.
