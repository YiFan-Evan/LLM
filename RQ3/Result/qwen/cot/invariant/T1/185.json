The function `selection_sort` sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm. In each pass through the outer loop, the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array is selected and moved to the beginning of the unsorted portion.\n\n### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nThe outer loop runs from `f = 0` to `f = len(arr) - 1`. During each iteration of this loop, the first `f` elements are already sorted and are the smallest `f` elements in the array. \n\n- **Invariant Statement**: After the i-th iteration of the outer loop (`f = i`), the first `i` elements of the array are the smallest `i` elements in their correct order.\n\nWe can express this as:\n- **Invariant**: `sorted_value = arr[:f]`\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nThe inner loop runs from `z = f + 1` to `z = len(arr) - 1`. This loop finds the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the element at position `f`.\n\n- **Invariant Statement**: After the j-th iteration of the inner loop (`z = j`), the element at position `f` is the smallest element in the subarray `arr[f+1:]`.\n\nWe can express this as:\n- **Invariant**: `smallest_value = min(arr[f+1:z+1])`\n\n### Combining the Invariants\n\nTo combine these invariants, we need to ensure that the invariants hold true after each iteration of the loops. Specifically:\n\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = arr[:f]`\n- For the inner loop: `smallest_value = min(arr[f+1:z+1])`\n\nHowever, since we need to provide the invariant in the specific format requested, we will focus on the outer loop invariant which directly corresponds to the sorting process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven the requirement to provide the loop invariant in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can state the invariant for the outer loop as follows:\n\n- **Invariant**: `sorted_value = arr[:f]`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- **Invariant**: `sorted_value = arr[:f]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    f = 0\n    while f <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = f + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[f]:\n                temp = arr[f]\n                arr[f] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        f += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the `selection_sort` function, we need to analyze the behavior of the algorithm during each iteration of the loop.
