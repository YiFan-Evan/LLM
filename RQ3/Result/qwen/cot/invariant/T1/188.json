We want to ensure that after each iteration of the outer loop, the first `i` elements are sorted and are the smallest `i` elements in the array.\n\n**Loop Invariant for the outer loop:**\n```python\nsorted_value = min(arr[:i+1])\n```\n\nThis means that after the `i`-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `i` elements of the array (`arr[0]` to `arr[i]`) are the smallest `i` elements in the array, and they are sorted.\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant:\nThe inner loop runs from `z = i + 1` to `z = len(arr) - 1`. This loop finds the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array (`arr[i+1:]`) and swaps it with the element at index `i` if it is smaller.\n\n**Loop Invariant for the inner loop:**\n```python\nmin_value = min(arr[i+1:])\n```\n\nThis means that after the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop, the minimum element in the subarray `arr[i+1:]` is correctly identified and potentially swapped with `arr[i]`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nCombining these invariants, we can state that after each iteration of the outer loop, the first `i` elements are the smallest `i` elements and are sorted. The inner loop ensures that the minimum element in the remaining unsorted part of the array is moved to the correct position.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n```python\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nsorted_value = min(arr[:i+1])\nmin_value = min(arr[i+1:])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find a loop invariant for the `selection_sort` function, let's analyze the behavior of both the outer and inner loops.\n\n### Outer Loop Invariant:\nThe outer loop iterates over the array indices from `i = 0` to `i = len(arr) - 1`.
