Here is the code again for reference:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr):\n        z = i  # Note: It seems there is a typo here, it should be `z = m`\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        m += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Outer Loop:\n- The outer loop runs from `m = 0` to `m < len(arr)`.\n- For each `m`, the inner loop ensures that the subarray `arr[0:m+1]` is sorted.\n\n### Inner Loop:\n- The inner loop runs from `z = m` to `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`.\n- This loop shifts elements to the right until `arr[z]` is no longer greater than `arr[z - 1]`.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\nWe need to find a statement that holds true before and after each iteration of the outer loop (`while m < len(arr)`).\n\nLet's consider the following invariant for the outer loop:\n\n- Before the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:m]` is sorted.\n- After the completion of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:m+1]` is sorted.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:m])`\n- `unsorted_value = fun(arr[m:len(arr)])`\n\nSince we are focusing on the sorted part, the loop invariant can be simplified to:\n\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:m])`\n\nGiven that `arr[0:m]` is sorted, we can say:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:m]` is sorted\n\nHowever, since we need to express this in the specific format requested:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:m]` is sorted\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:m]` is sorted\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be written as:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:m]` is sorted\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: sorted_value = arr[0:m] is sorted\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    m = 0\n    while m <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        m += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the provided `insertion_sort` function, we need to analyze the behavior of both the outer and inner loops.\n\n### Outer Loop Analysis:\nThe outer loop runs while `m <= len(arr) - 1`. During each iteration, the variable `m` increments by 1, effectively processing one more element from the unsorted portion of the array into the sorted portion.\n\n### Inner Loop Analysis:\nThe inner loop runs while `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`. This loop performs swaps to ensure that the subarray `arr[0:m]` remains sorted as new elements are added.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\nA loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For the outer loop, we want to capture the state of the array such that the first `m` elements are sorted.\n\nGiven that `m` starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each iteration, the invariant for the outer loop can be described as follows:\n\n- `arr[0:m]` is sorted.\n\nThis invariant holds true before the loop starts because initially, `m` is 0, and an empty array is trivially sorted. After each iteration, the inner loop ensures that the new element `arr[m]` is placed in the correct position within the sorted portion `arr[0:m]`.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be written as:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:m]` is sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: sorted_value = arr[0:m] is sorted\n```"}]
