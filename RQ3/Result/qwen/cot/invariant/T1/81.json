[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop iterates through the array, updating the variable `last_value` with the current element at each step.\n\nLet's analyze the state of the variables before and after each iteration:\n\n1. Before the loop starts:\n   - `b` is initialized to 0.\n   - `last_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`.\n\n2. During the loop:\n   - The loop runs as long as `b < len(arr)`.\n   - In each iteration, `last_value` is updated to the current element `arr[b]`.\n   - `b` is incremented by 1.\n\n3.
