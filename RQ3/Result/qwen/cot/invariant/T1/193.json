The outer loop iterates over each element in the array, and the inner loop finds the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array. If a smaller element is found, it is swapped with the current element in the outer loop.\n\n### Outer Loop Invariant:\nThe outer loop starts at index `n` and goes up to the length of the array. At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the first `n` elements of the array are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nSo, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `sorted_elements = n`\n\n### Inner Loop Invariant:\nThe inner loop starts at index `z` and goes up to the length of the array. At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the elements from index `n` to `z-1` are already in their correct positions in the sorted portion of the array.\n\nSo, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `min_element_index = min(z-1, index_of_smallest_element_in_subarray(n -> z))`\n\nHowever, since the task specifies the format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we need to adapt this to fit the format. Given the nature of the inner loop, we can say:\n\n- **Loop Invariant**: `min_value = min(arr[n]->arr[z-1])`\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the specific format required and the understanding of the loop's behavior, the appropriate loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `sorted_elements = n` \n\nThis means that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `n` elements of the array are sorted in non-decreasing order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    n = 0\n    while n <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = n + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[n]:\n                temp = arr[n]\n                arr[n] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        n += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given `selection_sort` function, we need to analyze the behavior of the loops and how they contribute to sorting the array.\n\n### Outer Loop Analysis:\nThe outer loop iterates from `n = 0` to `len(arr) - 1`. At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the first `n` elements of the array are partially sorted such that the smallest element among these `n` elements is in the `n`-th position.\n\n### Inner Loop Analysis:\nThe inner loop iterates from `z = n + 1` to `len(arr) - 1`. At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the elements from index `n` to `z-1` are already in their correct positions in the sorted portion of the array.
