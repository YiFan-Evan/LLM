A suitable invariant would be one that captures the relationship between `mid_value` and the elements of the array up to the current value of `d`.\n\nGiven the loop structure, a useful invariant could be:\n\n- `mid_value = arr[d]` for the current value of `d`.\n\nHowever, this invariant does not fully capture the loop's behavior because it does not account for the fact that `d` is incremented within the loop. Instead, a more appropriate invariant should reflect the relationship between `mid_value` and the elements processed so far.\n\nA better invariant would be:\n\n- `mid_value = arr[d]` for the current value of `d` before the increment.\n\nBut since we are looking for a general invariant that holds before each iteration, we can state:\n\n- `mid_value = arr[d]` for the current value of `d`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nmid_value = arr[d]\n```"}]
