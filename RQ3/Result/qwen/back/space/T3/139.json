Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise and then 14 steps counter-clockwise results in a total movement of 20 steps counter-clockwise.\n3. **Understand the circular nature:** Since there are 20 dots and we move 20 steps counter-clockwise, we effectively return to the same position we started from. This is because moving 20 steps counter-clockwise on a circular path with 20 dots brings us back to our original starting point.\n\nThus, starting from the African bush elephant and moving 20 steps counter-clockwise brings us back to the African bush elephant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: African bush elephant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
