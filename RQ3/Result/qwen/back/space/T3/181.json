We start at the apiary, and we track our position after each movement.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: The apiary.\n2. **First Movement (6 steps counter-clockwise)**: Since the map is circular, moving counter-clockwise means we subtract the number of steps from the current position. If we label the starting position as 0 (apiary), then moving 6 steps counter-clockwise brings us to position 14 (considering positions are modulo 20).\n\n3. **Second Movement (10 steps clockwise)**: Clockwise movement means adding the number of steps to the current position. So, from position 14, moving 10 steps clockwise brings us to position 4 (since 14 + 10 = 24, and 24 mod 20 = 4).\n\n4. **Third Movement (9 steps counter-clockwise)**: From position 4, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise brings us to position 15 (since 4 - 9 = -5, and -5 mod 20 = 15).\n\n5. **Fourth Movement (7 steps counter-clockwise)**: From position 15, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise brings us to position 8 (since 15 - 7 = 8, and 8 mod 20 = 8).\n\nNow, we need to identify the item located at position 8 on the circular path.
