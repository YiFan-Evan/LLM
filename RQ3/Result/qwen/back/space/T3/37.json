First, identify the initial position and the sequence of elements:\n   - Top (start): Moped\n   - Clockwise from there: Papillon, Bernese Mountain Dog, Poncho, Coyote\n\n2. Determine the starting point for the movements:\n   - Since the movements start from the coyote, which is the last element in the clockwise sequence, we can assign positions as follows (starting with the moped as position 0):\n     - Position 0: Moped\n     - Position 1: Papillon\n     - Position 2: Bernese Mountain Dog\n     - Position 3: Poncho\n     - Position 4: Coyote\n\n3.
