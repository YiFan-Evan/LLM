The circular path consists of 20 dots, so moving around the circle involves addition and subtraction modulo 20.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: You start at the hartebeest.\n2. **First Movement (Counter-Clockwise by 3 Steps)**: This means subtracting 3 from your current position (0 mod 20). So, your new position is \\(0 - 3 = -3 \\equiv 17 \\mod 20\\).\n3. **Second Movement (Clockwise by 16 Steps)**: This means adding 16 to your current position (17 mod 20). So, your new position is \\(17 + 16 = 33 \\equiv 13 \\mod 20\\).\n4. **Third Movement (Clockwise by 7 Steps)**: This means adding 7 to your current position (13 mod 20).
