We are asked to move 1 step counter-clockwise from the barn and then 1 step clockwise from the resulting position.\n\n1. Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the barn:\n   - The order moving counter-clockwise from the barn is: worm snake -> Chesapeake Bay Retriever -> toaster -> soap dispenser -> rock beauty -> pencil case -> Model T -> volcano -> banjo -> barn.\n   - Therefore, moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the barn lands us at the worm snake.\n\n2.
