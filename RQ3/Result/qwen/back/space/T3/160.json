The circular path consists of 20 dots, and each movement can be added or subtracted from the current position to determine the new position. Since the path is circular, if the calculated position exceeds the number of dots or goes below zero, we use modulo arithmetic to wrap around the circle.\n\nThe starting point after being at the ringlet (which is the 13th element) and moving according to the instructions is calculated as follows:\n\n1.
