Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: This means subtracting 5 from the current position (4). Since we are working with a circular path, if the result is negative, we add 10 to bring it back within the range of 0-9.\n   \\(4 - 5 = -1\\), and adding 10 gives us \\(9\\).\n\n2. Move 1 step counter-clockwise: Subtracting 1 from the current position (9).\n   \\(9 - 1 = 8\\).\n\n3. Move 10 steps clockwise: Adding 10 to the current position (8).
