The path has 10 dots, so moving around the path means that after the 10th step, you would be back at the starting point due to the circular nature.\n2. We start from the common gallinule.\n3. Then, we move 9 steps clockwise. Since there are only 10 dots, moving 9 steps clockwise means moving to the same position as if we moved 1 step clockwise (because 9 mod 10 = 9, but effectively it lands us on the next dot).\n4. Next, we move 6 steps counter-clockwise. Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from our current position is equivalent to moving 4 steps clockwise (because 6 steps counter-clockwise + 10 steps full circle = 16 steps, 16 mod 10 = 6, but moving counter-clockwise is the same as subtracting, so 10 - 6 = 4 steps clockwise).\n5. Finally, we move 7 steps counter-clockwise. This is equivalent to moving 3 steps clockwise (because 7 steps counter-clockwise + 10 steps full circle = 17 steps, 17 mod 10 = 7, but moving counter-clockwise is the same as subtracting, so 10 - 7 = 3 steps clockwise).\n\nNow let's calculate the final position:\n- Start: Common gallinule.\n- Move 1 step clockwise: Basset Hound.\n- Move 4 steps clockwise from Basset Hound: Dam.\n- Move 3 steps clockwise from Dam: Lemon.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Lemon."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
