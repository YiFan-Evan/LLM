Since the path consists of 20 dots, moving 20 steps in any direction brings us back to the same spot. Therefore, we can simplify the movement by calculating the net movement in terms of the remainder when divided by 20.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n- First, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 5 steps clockwise (since 20 - 15 = 5).\n- Then, we move 6 steps clockwise.\n- Next, we move 12 steps clockwise.\n- Finally, we move 8 steps clockwise.\n\nAdding these up: 5 + 6 + 12 + 8 = 31 steps clockwise in total. The net movement is the remainder of 31 divided by 20, which is 11 steps clockwise.\n\nStarting from the langur, we move 11 steps clockwise.
