Here's how we can break down the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Position**: The harvester is the third dot on the path.\n2. **Calculate Total Steps Moved**:\n   - First move: 8 steps clockwise.\n   - Second move: 36 steps clockwise. Since the path has 20 dots, 36 steps is equivalent to 36 % 20 = 16 steps clockwise.\n   - Third move: 12 steps clockwise.\n   - Fourth move: 32 steps clockwise. Similarly, 32 steps is equivalent to 32 % 20 = 12 steps clockwise.\n3. **Sum the Steps**:\n   - Total steps = 8 + 16 + 12 + 12 = 48 steps.\n   - Since the path has 20 dots, 48 steps is equivalent to 48 % 20 = 8 steps clockwise.\n4. **Determine Final Position**:\n   - Starting from the harvester (third dot), moving 8 steps clockwise lands us on the smooth newt (eleventh dot).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: smooth newt"}]
