The path consists of 20 dots, labeled sequentially starting from the swimming cap.\n2. We start at the prairie grouse, which is the 9th dot (if we number from 1 to 20, with the swimming cap being 1).\n3. We then move 16 steps clockwise, which would bring us to the 15th dot (since 9 + 16 = 25, and 25 mod 20 = 5, but since we started at 9, we need to adjust for the correct starting point, thus 9 + 16 - 20 = 5, so the 15th dot considering the circular nature).\n4. Next, we move 17 steps counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to moving 3 steps clockwise (since 20 - 17 = 3). This brings us to the 18th dot (15 + 3 = 18).\n5. Then, we move 5 steps counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to moving 15 steps clockwise (since 20 - 5 = 15). This brings us to the 13th dot (18 + 15 - 20 = 13, adjusting for the circular nature).\n6. Finally, we move 7 steps counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to moving 13 steps clockwise (since 20 - 7 = 13).
