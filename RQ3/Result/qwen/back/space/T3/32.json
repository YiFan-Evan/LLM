The circular path consists of 5 dots, and each dot has a specific object. Starting from the through arch bridge, the sequence of objects in a clockwise direction is:\n\n1. Through arch bridge\n2. Mail bag\n3. Lotion\n4. Little blue heron\n5. King Charles Spaniel\n\nSince the path is circular, moving counter-clockwise from the little blue heron (the 4th dot) by 5 steps means we actually complete one full loop and end up back at the same dot.
