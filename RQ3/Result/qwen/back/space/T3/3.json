Move 8 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Since the path has 5 dots, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(8 \\mod 5 = 3\\) steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the Race Car (position 5):\n     - From 5 to 4 (Chimpanzee)\n     - From 4 to 3 (Dumbbell)\n     - From 3 to 2 (Acorn Squash)\n   - So after moving 8 steps counter-clockwise, you are at the Acorn Squash (position 2).\n\n2. Move 8 steps clockwise:\n   - Again, since the path has 5 dots, moving 8 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(8 \\mod 5 = 3\\) steps clockwise.\n   - Moving 3 steps clockwise from the Acorn Squash (position 2):\n     - From 2 to 3 (Dumbbell)\n     - From 3 to 4 (Chimpanzee)\n     - From 4 to 5 (Race Car)\n   - So after moving 8 steps clockwise, you are at the Race Car (position 5).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Race Car"}]
