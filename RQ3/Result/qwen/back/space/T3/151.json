Therefore, moving 18 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise (because 20 - 18 = 2). Thus, the total movement is 2 steps + 2 steps = 4 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nStarting from the umbrella, if we move 4 steps counter-clockwise, we need to count backwards from the umbrella through the list of items provided.\n\nThe sequence from the umbrella backwards is:\n1. Mehalith\n2. Doormat\n3. Umbrella\n4.
