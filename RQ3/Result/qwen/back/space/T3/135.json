The circular path consists of 20 distinct positions (dots), and each movement involves advancing or retreating a specific number of steps in a specified direction.\n\nFirst, let's summarize the movements:\n- Move 15 steps clockwise.\n- Move 19 steps counter-clockwise.\n- Move 7 steps clockwise.\n- Move 15 steps clockwise.\n\nSince moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving forward in the opposite direction, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving \\(20 - 19 = 1\\) step clockwise. Thus, our movements can be simplified to:\n- Move 15 steps clockwise.\n- Move 1 step clockwise.\n- Move 7 steps clockwise.\n- Move 15 steps clockwise.\n\nAdding these movements together gives us a total movement of \\(15 + 1 + 7 + 15 = 38\\) steps clockwise. Since the path is circular with 20 dots, every 20 steps bring us back to the starting point. Therefore, we can reduce 38 steps modulo 20 to get the effective movement:\n\\[38 \\mod 20 = 18\\]\n\nThis means we move 18 steps clockwise from the starting point. We started at the Asian elephant.
