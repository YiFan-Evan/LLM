From the Komodo dragon, the jack-o'-lantern is the 6th element in the clockwise direction.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n- First movement: 16 steps clockwise from the jack-o'-lantern (6th element). Since the path is circular and has 10 elements, moving 16 steps clockwise from the 6th element lands us at the 2nd element (because 6 + 16 = 22, and 22 mod 10 = 2).\n- Second movement: 12 steps counter-clockwise from the current position. Moving 12 steps counter-clockwise from the 2nd element (gown) lands us at the 4th element (toy store) (because 2 - 12 = -10, and -10 mod 10 = 0, which corresponds to the 10th element, but since we need to subtract one more step, we end up at the 4th element).\n- Third movement: 6 steps counter-clockwise from the current position. Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the 4th element (toy store) lands us at the 8th element (Curly-coated Retriever) (because 4 - 6 = -2, and -2 mod 10 = 8).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Curly-coated Retriever"}]
