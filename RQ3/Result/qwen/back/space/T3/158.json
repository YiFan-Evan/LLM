Since the path is circular, moving counter-clockwise by a certain number of steps is equivalent to moving clockwise by (20 - number of steps). We need to sum up all the effective clockwise movements modulo 20 to determine the final position.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n1. Move 19 steps counter-clockwise:\n   This is equivalent to moving 20 - 19 = 1 step clockwise.\n   \n2. Move 15 steps clockwise:\n   This is already a clockwise movement.\n   \n3. Move 12 steps clockwise:\n   This is also a clockwise movement.\n   \n4. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise:\n   This is equivalent to moving 20 - 5 = 15 steps clockwise.\n\nNow, let's sum these effective clockwise movements:\n1 + 15 + 12 + 15 = 43\n\nSince the path has 20 dots, we need to take the result modulo 20:\n43 % 20 = 3\n\nSo, starting from the gas pump, we effectively move 3 steps clockwise.
