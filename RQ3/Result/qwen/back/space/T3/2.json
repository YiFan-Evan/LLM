Since the path consists of 5 dots, any movement that exceeds 5 steps will loop back to the beginning due to its circular structure. \n\n1. First, we identify the starting point, which is the Airedale Terrier.\n2. We then calculate the total steps taken in a clockwise direction: 3 steps initially, and then 5 steps subsequently. The total number of steps is 3 + 5 = 8 steps.\n3. Given the circular nature of the path, every 5 steps bring us back to the starting position because there are 5 dots. Therefore, 8 steps is equivalent to 3 steps (since 8 mod 5 equals 3).\n4.
