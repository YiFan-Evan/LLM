The path consists of 20 connected dots, so moving counter-clockwise means subtracting the number of steps from the current position. If the subtraction results in a negative number, we can convert it into a positive position by adding 20 (since the path loops back onto itself).\n\nThe starting position is the Afghan Hound. We then perform the movements in sequence:\n\n1. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Since the Afghan Hound is the 9th dot (counting starts from 0), moving 13 steps back lands us at the position (9 - 13) = -4.\n   - Converting -4 into a positive position gives us (-4 + 20) = 16.\n\n2. Move 15 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - From position 16, moving 15 steps back gives us (16 - 15) = 1.\n\n3. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - From position 1, moving 13 steps back gives us (1 - 13) = -12.\n   - Converting -12 into a positive position gives us (-12 + 20) = 8.\n\n4. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - From position 8, moving 8 steps back gives us (8 - 8) = 0.\n\nSince the path is indexed starting from 0, position 0 corresponds to the tricycle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: tricycle"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
