The strategy involves calculating the net movement (clockwise or counterclockwise) and adjusting for the circular nature of the path.\n\nThe initial position is on the pelican. Each movement is cumulative, and because the path is circular, if you go past the end, you wrap around to the beginning.\n\n1. From the pelican, moving 4 steps clockwise means landing on the stage.\n2. Then, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the stage means subtracting 6 steps from the current position (stage). Since the stage is the 18th dot (assuming the pelican is the 16th dot and counting clockwise), moving 6 steps back lands us on the 12th dot, which is a trifle.\n3. Moving another 6 steps counter-clockwise from the trifle lands us on the 6th dot (trifle - 6 steps = 6th dot, which is a coucal).\n4. Finally, moving 12 steps counter-clockwise from the coucal brings us to the 6th dot - 12 steps. Since we can't have negative positions on a circle, we calculate this as 20 (total dots) - 6 (remaining steps after full circles) = 14th dot, which is a switch.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: switch."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Here's how we'll approach it:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: On the pelican.\n2. **First Movement**: Move 8 steps clockwise from the pelican.\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 12 steps counter-clockwise.\n4. **Third Movement**: Move another 12 steps counter-clockwise.\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Move 24 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nWe need to calculate the net movement and then determine the final position based on the circular path.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n1. **First Movement**:\n   - Start at the pelican (position 16).\n   - Move 8 steps clockwise: \\( 16 + 8 = 24 \\).
