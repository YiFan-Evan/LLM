Let's number the dots for easier calculation, starting with the Dobermann as position 3 (since the Dobermann is the third dot in the sequence).\n2. **First move (4 steps counter-clockwise):** Position 3 - 4 = -1. Since the path has 10 dots, -1 wraps around to 9 (the tenth dot, which is the television).\n3. **Second move (3 steps counter-clockwise):** Position 9 - 3 = 6.
