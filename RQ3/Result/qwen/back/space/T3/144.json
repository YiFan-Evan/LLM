Move 9 steps clockwise: \n   - Position = (Position + 9) mod 20.\n   - Golden Retriever is the 16th element, so Position = (16 + 9) mod 20 = 5.\n\n2.

Move 18 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Position = (Position - 18) mod 20.\n   - Position = (19 - 18) mod 20 = 1.\n\nNow, we need to identify what is at the position corresponding to 1 on the circular path.
