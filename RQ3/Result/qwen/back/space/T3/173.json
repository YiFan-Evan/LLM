The circular path has 20 dots, so any movement greater than 20 steps can be reduced modulo 20 to find the equivalent movement within one full circle.\n\nStarting position is at the shower curtain. Let's break down the movements:\n\n1. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Counter-clockwise movement is equivalent to subtracting steps.\n   - Position = (Position - 6) % 20\n\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise:\n   - Clockwise movement is equivalent to adding steps.\n   - Position = (Position + 2) % 20\n\n3. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Position = (Position - 5) % 20\n\n4. Move 10 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Position = (Position - 10) % 20\n\nLet's calculate step-by-step:\n\n- Start at the shower curtain.\n- Shower curtain is the 18th item in the list (counting from 0).\n\n1. After moving 6 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - New position = (18 - 6) % 20 = 12 % 20 = 12 (Bluetick Coonhound)\n\n2.

After moving 5 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - New position = (14 - 5) % 20 = 9 % 20 = 9 (Ski)\n\n4.
