Given that there are 10 positions on the path, moving 20 steps is equivalent to completing two full circles (since 20 steps / 10 positions per circle = 2 circles). Therefore, moving 20 steps from any starting point will bring you back to the same starting point.\n\nStarting from the \"vestment\" and moving 20 steps in a clockwise direction means you complete two full cycles around the path and return to the \"vestment.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: vestment"}]
