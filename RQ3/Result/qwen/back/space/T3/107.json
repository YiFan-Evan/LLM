Here's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Position**: The initial position is at the pencil case.\n2. **Determine Movements**:\n   - First movement: Move 6 steps clockwise from the pencil case.\n   - Second movement: Move 10 steps counterclockwise from the new position.\n\n3. **Calculate Final Position**:\n   - The circular path has 10 positions, so moving 10 steps counterclockwise is equivalent to moving 0 steps (since 10 mod 10 = 0), meaning we stay in the same position after the second movement.\n\n4. **Track Movements on Path**:\n   - Starting at the pencil case (position 5 if we number the positions from 0 to 9 starting from the top):\n     - Moving 6 steps clockwise: \n       - From position 5 to 6 (basketball)\n       - To 7 (pedestal)\n       - To 8 (conch)\n       - To 9 (pencil case)\n       - To 0 (neck brace)\n       - To 1 (miniskirt)\n       - We end up at position 1 (miniskirt).\n     - Moving 10 steps counterclockwise from position 1 is the same as not moving at all since 10 mod 10 = 0.

This means moving 2 steps clockwise from the starting position.\n   - Starting position is the pencil case (position 4). Moving 2 steps clockwise: \n     - From position 4 to 5 (neck brace)\n     - From position 5 to 6 (miniskirt)\n     - Final position after first movement is position 6 (miniskirt).\n   - Second movement (20 steps counterclockwise): \\( 20 \\mod 10 = 0 \\).
