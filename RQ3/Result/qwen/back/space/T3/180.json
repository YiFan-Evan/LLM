Each movement can be either clockwise (positive) or counter-clockwise (negative). The path is circular, so moving past the last dot will bring us back to the beginning.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n1. Start at the tile roof.\n2. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: -3 steps.\n3. Move 7 steps clockwise: +7 steps.\n4. Move 11 steps clockwise: +11 steps.\n5. Move 9 steps counter-clockwise: -9 steps.\n\nSumming these movements:\n-3 + 7 + 11 - 9 = 6 steps clockwise.\n\nStarting from the tile roof (which is our reference point), moving 6 steps clockwise means we end up at the red panda.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: red panda."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
