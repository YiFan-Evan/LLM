Move 13 steps clockwise.\n\nLet's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Clockwise movements total: 18 + 9 + 13 = 40 steps.\n- Counterclockwise movement: 14 steps.\n- Net clockwise movement: 40 - 14 = 26 steps.\n\nSince the path has 20 dots, moving 26 steps is equivalent to moving 26 mod 20 = 6 steps clockwise.\n\nStarting from the sunscreen, moving 6 steps clockwise means we pass through:\n- Sea cucumber (1 step)\n- Bluetick Coonhound (2 steps)\n- Sunscreen (3 steps, back to the starting point)\n- Butternut squash (4 steps)\n- Dowitcher (5 steps)\n- An Italian Greyhound (6 steps)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Italian Greyhound."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
