Understand the movement directions: First, you move 9 steps counter-clockwise, then 7 steps clockwise, and finally 6 steps clockwise.\n3. Calculate the net movement: Since moving counter-clockwise effectively subtracts steps from the total count, we can compute the net movement around the circle.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n- Starting from the limousine, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise brings you to the black grouse (since the sequence is: limousine -> soccer ball -> Miniature Poodle -> baboon -> bell-cot -> crane -> Keeshond -> macaque -> black grouse).\n- From the black grouse, moving 7 steps clockwise lands you at the Miniature Poodle (black grouse -> macaque -> Keeshond -> crane -> bell-cot -> baboon -> limousine -> Miniature Poodle).\n- Finally, moving 6 steps clockwise from the Miniature Poodle lands you at the soccer ball (Miniature Poodle -> baboon -> bell-cot -> crane -> Keeshond -> macaque -> soccer ball).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: soccer ball."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
