We need to move 5 steps clockwise from the black swan.\n\nGiven that there are only 5 dots, moving 5 steps clockwise from any dot will bring us back to the same dot again due to the circular arrangement.\n\nStarting from the black swan and moving 5 steps clockwise means we end up back at the black swan.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: black swan"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
