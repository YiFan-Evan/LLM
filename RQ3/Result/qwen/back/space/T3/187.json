Identify the item at the final position.\n\nFirst, let's determine the initial position and the sequence of movement:\n- Initial position: Academic gown.\n- Move 7 steps clockwise from the academic gown. The sequence is: academic gown -> maypole -> rugby ball -> poke bonnet -> switch -> holster -> grey whale -> vacuum cleaner.\n- So after 7 steps, you are at the vacuum cleaner.\n- Now, move 20 steps counter-clockwise from the vacuum cleaner. Since the path is circular and has 20 dots, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise will bring you back to the same spot. Therefore, you are still at the vacuum cleaner.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: vacuum cleaner."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
