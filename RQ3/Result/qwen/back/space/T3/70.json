Since the path is circular with 10 dots, we use modulo 10 arithmetic. So, the new position is \\((5 - 4) \\mod 10 = 1\\). This puts us at the CRT screen.\n4. **Second Movement**: Again moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the CRT screen (position 1), we get \\((1 - 4) \\mod 10 = -3 \\mod 10 = 7\\). This puts us at the sidewinder.\n5. **Third Movement**: Finally, moving 10 steps clockwise from the sidewinder (position 7), since moving 10 steps on a 10-dot path brings us back to the same position, the new position remains 7. This still places us at the sidewinder.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: sidewinder"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
