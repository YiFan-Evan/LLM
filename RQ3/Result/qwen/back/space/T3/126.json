The circular nature means that after reaching the end of the list, one would loop back to the beginning. The steps provided for movement need to be accumulated and then reduced modulo the total number of positions to find the final position.\n\nGiven:\n- Total positions = 20.\n- Initial position after starting from the plate rack = 9 (since the plate rack is the 10th element, counting starts from 0).\n- Movements: +15, +14, +8, -3 (counter-clockwise).\n\nFirst, sum the movements:\n\\[15 + 14 + 8 - 3 = 34\\]\n\nThen, reduce this sum modulo 20 to find the net movement:\n\\[34 \\mod 20 = 14\\]\n\nStarting from position 9 (plate rack), move 14 steps clockwise:\n\\[9 + 14 = 23\\]\nSince there are only 20 positions, we wrap around:\n\\[23 \\mod 20 = 3\\]\n\nSo, you end up at the 3rd position on the circular path.
