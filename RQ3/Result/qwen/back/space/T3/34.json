Table Lamp (TL)\n\nStarting position: TL (Table Lamp)\n- Moving 6 steps clockwise: Since there are only 5 dots, moving 6 steps is equivalent to moving 1 step (as 6 mod 5 = 1). So, from TL, moving 1 step clockwise lands us on Lg (Langur).\n- Then, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise: Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from Langur (Lg) would land us on EDR (Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake) (as Lg -> Pr -> BC -> EDR).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake"}]
