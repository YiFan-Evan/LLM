The path consists of 5 dots arranged in a circle.\n2. We start at the mortar and move 4 steps clockwise. Since there are only 5 dots, moving 4 steps clockwise means we end up at the same dot we started from (because moving 5 steps would bring us full circle back to the starting point).\n3. From the starting point (mortar), we then move 4 steps counter-clockwise. Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the mortar means we effectively move 1 step clockwise (since moving 5 steps would bring us full circle, and moving 4 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: screw"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.

Each complete loop around the path (5 steps) brings you back to the starting position.\n2. Moving 8 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(8 \\mod 5 = 3\\) steps clockwise because \\(8 - 5 = 3\\).\n3.
