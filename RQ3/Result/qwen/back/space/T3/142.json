The starting element is the trimaran, which is the 15th item on the list (counting starts from 1 at the top of the path with the harvester).\n\nThe movements are as follows:\n1. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n2. Move 12 steps clockwise.\n3. Move 17 steps clockwise.\n4. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nSince the path has 20 dots, moving counter-clockwise can be represented as subtracting steps, and moving clockwise can be represented as adding steps, all modulo 20 (to account for the circular nature of the path).\n\nLet's calculate the net effect of these movements:\n\n1. Start at the trimaran (15).\n2. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise: \\(15 - 8 = 7\\).\n3. Move 12 steps clockwise: \\(7 + 12 = 19\\).\n4. Move 17 steps clockwise: \\(19 + 17 \\mod 20 = 16\\).\n5. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise: \\(16 - 13 = 3\\).\n\nSo, after all the movements, you end up at the 3rd dot.
