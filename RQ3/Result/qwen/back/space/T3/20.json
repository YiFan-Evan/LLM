Motorboat\n5. Kerry Blue Terrier\n\nStarting from the Skunk (position 3), we will perform two movements:\n\n1. Move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction.\n2. Move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\nLet's calculate the new position after each movement:\n\n### First Movement:\n- Current Position: Skunk (3)\n- Move 1 step clockwise: 3 + 1 = 4 (Motorboat)\n\n### Second Movement:\n- New Current Position: Motorboat (4)\n- Move 3 steps clockwise: 4 + 3 = 7\n- Since the path is circular with 5 positions, we need to take modulo 5 of 7: 7 mod 5 = 2 (Hair Spray)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Hair Spray"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
