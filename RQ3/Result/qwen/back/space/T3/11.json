Second movement: Move 4 more steps counter-clockwise.\n   - From Dot 1 (African Wild Dog), moving 4 steps counter-clockwise lands us at Dot 2 (Standard Schnauzer).\n\nHowever, since we moved 6 steps initially and then 4 more steps, the total movement is 10 steps counter-clockwise. This is equivalent to moving 0 steps counter-clockwise (since 10 mod 5 = 0). Thus, we remain at Dot 2 (Standard Schnauzer).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Standard Schnauzer"}]
