So, moving 14 steps is equivalent to moving 4 steps clockwise.\n  - Starting from the paper towel and moving 4 steps clockwise, you land on the crossword.\n\n- **Second Movement (20 steps clockwise)**:\n  - Similarly, reducing 20 steps modulo 10 gives \\(20 \\mod 10 = 0\\). This means moving 20 steps is equivalent to moving 0 steps, or staying in the same place.\n  - Therefore, starting from the crossword and moving 0 steps keeps you at the crossword.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: crossword"}]
