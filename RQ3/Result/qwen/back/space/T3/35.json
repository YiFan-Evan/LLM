The circular path consists of 5 distinct items placed in a clockwise sequence: Carolina anole, brown bear, quill, paddle, and marmoset. We start at the Carolina anole and move 5 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nSince the path is circular and has only 5 positions, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from any position will bring us back to the same position due to the nature of circular movement.
