The circular path consists of five dots with the following items:\n   - Top dot (starting point): Lynx\n   - Clockwise from Lynx: Hair spray, Chickadee, Trilobite, French horn\n\n2. We start from the Chickadee and move 5 steps counter-clockwise.\n3.

Identify the starting position and the sequence of items:\n   - Starting point: Chickadee\n   - Sequence of items (clockwise from the top): Lynx, Hair spray, Chickadee, Trilobite, French horn\n\n2. Understand the movement:\n   - Movement: 10 steps counter-clockwise\n   - Since there are 5 dots, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 full circles (10 mod 5 = 0, but considering the counter-clockwise direction, it's equivalent to 2 steps counter-clockwise).\n\n3. Calculate the new position:\n   - Starting from the Chickadee, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise means moving to the Trilobite.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Trilobite"}]
