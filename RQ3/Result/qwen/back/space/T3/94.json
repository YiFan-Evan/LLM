First, determine the starting point based on the provided sequence. The sequence is:\n   - Top (Start): Dowitcher\n   - Clockwise from there: Bakery, Wing, Tray, Chiffonier, Snoek, Barber Chair, Plow, High-Speed Train, Crayfish\n\n2. Since the bakery is the second element in the sequence, we can identify the positions of all elements relative to the bakery:\n   - Bakery (0 steps)\n   - Wing (1 step clockwise)\n   - Tray (2 steps clockwise)\n   - Chiffonier (3 steps clockwise)\n   - Snoek (4 steps clockwise)\n   - Barber Chair (5 steps clockwise)\n   - Plow (6 steps clockwise)\n   - High-Speed Train (7 steps clockwise)\n   - Crayfish (8 steps clockwise)\n   - Dowitcher (9 steps clockwise)\n\n3. Start from the bakery (position 0) and move counter-clockwise by 7 steps:\n   - 0 steps from bakery = Bakery\n   - 1 step counter-clockwise = Crayfish (8 steps clockwise from top)\n   - 2 steps counter-clockwise = High-Speed Train (7 steps clockwise from top)\n   - 3 steps counter-clockwise = Plow (6 steps clockwise from top)\n   - 4 steps counter-clockwise = Barber Chair (5 steps clockwise from top)\n   - 5 steps counter-clockwise = Snoek (4 steps clockwise from top)\n   - 6 steps counter-clockwise = Chiffonier (3 steps clockwise from top)\n   - 7 steps counter-clockwise = Tray (2 steps clockwise from top)\n\n4.

Since the path is circular, \\(-4 \\mod 10 = 6\\). So, we end up at the Plow.\n   - Move 6 steps clockwise from Plow: \\(6 + 6 = 12\\). Since the path is circular, \\(12 \\mod 10 = 2\\).
