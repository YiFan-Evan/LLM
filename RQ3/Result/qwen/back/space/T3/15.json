Since the path is circular, after the odometer, the next element would be the Redbone Coonhound again, repeating the cycle.\n\nStarting from the odometer, which is the last element in the list, if we move three steps clockwise, we will pass the Redbone Coonhound, cannon, and waffle iron, landing on the tricycle.
