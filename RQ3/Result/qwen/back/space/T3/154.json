The circular path has 20 dots, meaning every 20 steps will bring us back to the starting point due to the circular arrangement.\n\nStarting from the ptarmigan, moving 2 steps clockwise brings us to the next item. Given the sequence starting from the ptarmigan, the order is:\n1. Ptarmigan (starting point)\n2. Staffordshire Bull Terrier (after 1 step)\n3. Eraser (after 2 steps)\n\nNext, moving 20 steps from the eraser means we complete a full circle and end up back at the same position relative to the start of the 20-step movement. Since 20 steps is equivalent to moving all the way around the circle, we land back at the eraser again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: eraser"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
