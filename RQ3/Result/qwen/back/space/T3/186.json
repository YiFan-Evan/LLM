So, 10 steps from the green mamba lands us on the rock crab.\n3. **Second Movement (Counter-Clockwise by 12 steps):**\n   - Moving 12 steps counter-clockwise from the rock crab brings us to the analog clock.\n4. **Third Movement (Clockwise by 34 steps):**\n   - Moving 34 steps clockwise is equivalent to 34 % 20 = 14 steps clockwise.
