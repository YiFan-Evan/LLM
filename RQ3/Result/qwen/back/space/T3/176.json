Let's number the dots for easier reference, with the football helmet being Dot 2 (since the top dot has a moving van and the sequence starts from there).\n\n2. **First Movement**: Moving 15 steps counter-clockwise from Dot 2.\n   - Since the path is circular, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 15 from the current position.\n   - Position after first movement = 2 - 15 = -13 (but since we're dealing with a circle of 20 dots, we take the remainder when divided by 20).\n   - -13 mod 20 = 7. Therefore, after the first movement, you are at Dot 7.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from Dot 7.\n   - Position after second movement = 7 - 8 = -1 (again, taking the remainder when divided by 20).\n   - -1 mod 20 = 19. Therefore, after the second movement, you are at Dot 19.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from Dot 19.\n   - Position after third movement = 19 - 20 = -1 (taking the remainder when divided by 20).\n   - -1 mod 20 = 19. Therefore, after the third movement, you remain at Dot 19.\n\nNow, let's identify what is located at Dot 19. According to the provided list of items, the item at Dot 19 is a suspension bridge.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: suspension bridge"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
