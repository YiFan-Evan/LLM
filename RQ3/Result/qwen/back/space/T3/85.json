Given the circular path has 10 dots, moving a certain number of steps means counting those steps in a clockwise direction until we reach the final dot. We can use modular arithmetic to simplify our calculations, specifically calculating the position modulo 10 (since there are 10 dots).\n\nStarting from the jack-o'-lantern, let's calculate the new positions step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial Position:** Jack-o'-lantern.\n2. **First Movement (7 steps):** Starting from the jack-o'-lantern, if we count 7 steps forward, we end up at the fiddler crab (because the sequence is: jack-o'-lantern -> cuirass -> slip-on shoe -> missile -> lakeshore -> chimpanzee -> southern black widow -> fiddler crab).\n3. **Second Movement (9 steps):** From the fiddler crab, counting 9 steps forward brings us back to the southern black widow (because 9 steps from the fiddler crab lands us at the southern black widow after wrapping around the circle multiple times).\n4. **Third Movement (2 steps):** Finally, from the southern black widow, counting 2 steps forward brings us to the chimpanzee.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: chimpanzee."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
