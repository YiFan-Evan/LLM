Move 10 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Counter-clockwise movement is equivalent to subtracting steps.\n   - Position after 10 steps: \\(6 - 10 = -4\\).\n   - Since we are on a circular path with 10 dots, we adjust for negative positions using modulo operation:\n     \\(-4 \\mod 10 = 6\\). (We are back at position 6.)\n\n2. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Position after 8 steps: \\(6 - 8 = -2\\).\n   - Adjust for negative positions using modulo operation:\n     \\(-2 \\mod 10 = 8\\). (Position 8 corresponds to the stone wall.)\n\n3. Move 18 steps clockwise:\n   - Clockwise movement is equivalent to adding steps.\n   - Position after 18 steps: \\(8 + 18 = 26\\).\n   - Adjust for full circles using modulo operation:\n     \\(26 \\mod 10 = 6\\).
