Joystick\n16. Wild boar\n17. Warthog\n18. Mobile phone\n19. Pirate ship\n\nNow, let's calculate the final position after each movement:\n\n1. Move 8 steps clockwise from the Cairn Terrier:\n   - Initial position: Cairn Terrier (position 1)\n   - After 8 steps: Position 9 (Collie)\n\n2. Move 18 steps clockwise from the Collie:\n   - Current position: Collie (position 9)\n   - After 18 steps: Position 7 (Car wheel), since 9 + 18 = 27, and 27 mod 20 = 7\n\n3. Move 1 step clockwise from the Car wheel:\n   - Current position: Car wheel (position 7)\n   - After 1 step: Position 8 (Dandie Dinmont Terrier)\n\n4. Move 10 steps clockwise from the Dandie Dinmont Terrier:\n   - Current position: Dandie Dinmont Terrier (position 8)\n   - After 10 steps: Position 18 (Mobile phone), since 8 + 10 = 18\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Mobile phone"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

We start from the Cairn Terrier, which is at position 1. Let's break down the movements step-by-step:\n\n1. Move 16 steps clockwise from the Cairn Terrier:\n   - Initial position: Cairn Terrier (position 1)\n   - After 16 steps: Position 17 (Warthog), since 1 + 16 = 17\n\n2.

Move 2 steps clockwise from the Volleyball:\n   - Current position: Volleyball (position 13)\n   - After 2 steps: Position 15 (Joystick), since 13 + 2 = 15\n\n4.
