We start moving from the reflex camera. Each movement needs to be counted step-by-step in the specified direction.\n3. Moving clockwise means we proceed in the order listed. Moving counter-clockwise means we go backward in the order listed.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n- From the reflex camera, moving 6 steps clockwise lands us at the ice cream.\n- From the ice cream, moving 1 step counter-clockwise brings us back to the vacuum cleaner.\n- From the vacuum cleaner, moving 2 steps clockwise takes us to the European green lizard.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: European green lizard"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
