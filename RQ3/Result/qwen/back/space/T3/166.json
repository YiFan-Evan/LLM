The sequence of movements involves counter-clockwise (backwards) and clockwise (forwards) steps. Given that the path is circular, moving past the last dot will loop back to the beginning.\n\nThe initial position is the Maltese, which is the fourth dot in the sequence (electric ray, conch, lampshade, Maltese). We will calculate the final position by summing all the movements considering the circular nature of the path.\n\nStarting position: 4 (Maltese)\n\n1. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise:\n   4 - 3 = 1 (Electric ray)\n\n2. Move 19 steps clockwise:\n   1 + 19 = 20 (Pekingese)\n\n3.
