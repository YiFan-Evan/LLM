The circular path consists of 10 dots, so every time we move past the 10th dot, we wrap around back to the beginning.\n\nThe initial position is on the \"newt.\" We can number the positions starting with the newt as 0, loggerhead sea turtle as 1, Bluetick Coonhound as 2, and so on until the tray as 9.\n\nStarting from the newt (position 0):\n- First movement: 7 steps clockwise. Since the path is circular, we calculate the new position modulo 10.\n- Second movement: 3 steps counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to moving 7 steps clockwise (since 10 - 3 = 7).\n- Third movement: 4 steps clockwise.\n\nLet's compute these step-by-step:\n\n1. Starting position: newt (0)\n2. After moving 7 steps clockwise: (0 + 7) % 10 = 7 (position of the Alaskan Malamute)\n3. Then moving 3 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 7 steps clockwise from the current position: (7 + 7) % 10 = 14 % 10 = 4 (position of the sloth bear)\n4.
