Each movement involves moving a certain number of steps clockwise. Since the map is circular, if the total number of steps exceeds 20, we must use modulo 20 to determine the final position.\n\nFirst, let's identify the starting point. The European polecat is our starting position. We can label the positions as follows (starting from the European polecat):\n\n1. European polecat\n2. Toy terrier\n3. Military aircraft\n4. Common squirrel monkey\n5. Coral reef\n6. Beagle\n7. Bow tie\n8. Tights\n9. Ski\n10. Binoculars\n11. Seashore\n12. Cardigan\n13. Siamang (start point)\n14. Coho salmon\n15. Wolf spider\n16. Otterhound\n17. Crane (bird)\n18. Pot pie\n19. Dhole\n20. Yawl\n\nNow, we apply the movements:\n\n1. Move 5 steps clockwise from the European polecat:\n   - Current position: European polecat (1)\n   - New position: Ski (9)\n\n2. Move 18 steps clockwise from Ski:\n   - Current position: Ski (9)\n   - Steps needed within one full circle (20 steps): 18 mod 20 = 18\n   - New position: Binoculars (10)\n\n3. Move another 18 steps clockwise from Binoculars:\n   - Current position: Binoculars (10)\n   - Steps needed within one full circle (20 steps): 18 mod 20 = 18\n   - New position: Seashore (11)\n\n4. Finally, move 5 steps clockwise from the Seashore:\n   - Current position: Seashore (11)\n   - New position: Cardigan (12)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Cardigan"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
