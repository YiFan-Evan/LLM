Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Position:** The initial position is the tent.\n2. **Track Movements:**\n   - Move 2 steps counter-clockwise (backwards) from the tent.\n   - Move 5 steps clockwise (forwards) from the new position.\n   - Move 9 steps clockwise (forwards) from the new position.\n   - Move 8 steps counter-clockwise (backwards) from the new position.\n\n3. **Circular Path Consideration:** Since the path is circular with 20 dots, moving past the starting point brings you back to the beginning of the circle. For example, if you move beyond the 20th dot, you loop back to the 1st dot.\n\n4. **Calculate Final Position:** We can calculate the final position by summing all the movements considering the direction (clockwise is positive, counter-clockwise is negative) and using modulo 20 to wrap around the circle.\n\nLet's do the calculation step-by-step:\n\n- Start at the tent (position 3, since the face powder is position 1).\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: \\(3 - 2 = 1\\).\n- Move 5 steps clockwise: \\(1 + 5 = 6\\).\n- Move 9 steps clockwise: \\(6 + 9 = 15\\).\n- Move 8 steps counter-clockwise: \\(15 - 8 = 7\\).\n\nThe final position is 7, which corresponds to the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
