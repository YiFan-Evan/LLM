The circular path consists of 20 distinct items, so moving 20 steps in any direction brings us back to the starting point. Therefore, moving 11 steps counter-clockwise and then 11 steps clockwise can be simplified by calculating the net movement.\n\nMoving 11 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 9 steps clockwise (since 20 - 11 = 9). Then, adding another 11 steps clockwise gives us a total movement of 20 steps clockwise, which is equivalent to moving 0 steps since we end up exactly where we started.\n\nStarting from the European garden spider, moving 0 steps means we remain at the same dot.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: European garden spider"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
