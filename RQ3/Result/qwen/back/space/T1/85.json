The principle here involves calculating the net movement and then determining the position based on the number of dots.\n\nFirstly, let's list out the initial positions of the items on the circular path starting from the top (slip-on shoe) and moving clockwise:\n1. Slip-on shoe\n2. Missile\n3. Lakeshore\n4. Chimpanzee\n5. Southern black widow\n6. Ostrich\n7. Hook\n8. Fiddler crab\n9. Jack-o'-lantern\n10. Cuirass\n\nNext, we track the movements:\n- Start from the Jack-o'-lantern (position 9).\n- Move 7 steps clockwise: \\(9 + 7 = 16\\). Since there are only 10 positions, we take \\(16 \\mod 10 = 6\\), so the new position is 6.\n- From position 6, move 9 steps clockwise: \\(6 + 9 = 15\\). Again, \\(15 \\mod 10 = 5\\), so the new position is 5.\n- From position 5, move 2 steps clockwise: \\(5 + 2 = 7\\).
