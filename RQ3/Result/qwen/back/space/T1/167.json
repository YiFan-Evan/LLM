Each step involves moving a specified number of positions clockwise and determining the item found at the final position.\n\nThe initial position is the drum. The sequence of movements is as follows:\n1. Move 3 steps clockwise.\n2. Move 13 steps clockwise.\n3. Move 20 steps clockwise.\n\nSince the path has 20 dots, moving 20 steps is equivalent to moving 0 steps (as 20 steps bring you back to the starting position). Therefore, the effective movements are just the first two movements.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n- Start at the drum.\n- Move 3 steps clockwise from the drum: Drum -> Megalith -> Jacamar -> Gas Mask.\n- From the gas mask, move 13 steps clockwise. Since the path has 20 dots, moving 13 steps is equivalent to moving 13 steps forward from the current position (Gas Mask).\n\nStarting from the gas mask and counting 13 steps forward:\n1. Gas Mask\n2. Griffon Bruxellois\n3. Pajamas\n4. Envelope\n5. Llama\n6. Ground Beetle\n7. Mongoose\n8. Flamingo\n9. Ruffed Grouse\n10. Football Helmet\n11. Orange\n12. Bobsleigh\n13.
