Starting position: Pajamas.\n2. Move counter-clockwise by 1 step:\n   - From Pajamas to Indian Cobra (since moving counter-clockwise means moving backwards in the sequence).\n3. Move clockwise by 5 steps:\n   - Since the path is circular with 5 dots, moving 5 steps clockwise from Indian Cobra brings us back to the same position because 5 steps wrap around the entire circle.\n\nTherefore, the final position is Indian Cobra.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Indian Cobra"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
