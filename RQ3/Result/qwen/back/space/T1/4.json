Given that there are 5 dots on the circular path, every 5 steps will bring us back to the starting point because the path is circular with 5 elements.\n\nStarting from the paintbrush, moving 5 steps clockwise means we will circle the entire path once and end up back at the same spot where we started, which is the paintbrush.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: paintbrush"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
