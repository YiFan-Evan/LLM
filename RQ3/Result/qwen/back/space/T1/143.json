Start from the dugong.\n2. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n3. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise.\n4. Move 5 steps clockwise.\n5. Move 16 steps clockwise.\n\nLet's calculate the net movement:\n\n1. Starting position: dugong.\n2. Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise means moving 12 steps clockwise (since 20 - 8 = 12).\n3. Moving 2 more steps counter-clockwise means moving another 18 steps clockwise (since 20 - 2 = 18).\n4. Then, moving 5 steps clockwise brings us to 23 steps clockwise from the dugong (12 + 18 + 5 = 35). Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we can reduce 35 modulo 20 to get the effective movement: 35 mod 20 = 15 steps clockwise from the dugong.\n5. Finally, moving 16 steps clockwise results in a total movement of 31 steps clockwise from the dugong (15 + 16 = 31). Again, reducing 31 modulo 20 gives us the effective movement: 31 mod 20 = 11 steps clockwise from the dugong.\n\nStarting from the dugong (position 14), moving 11 steps clockwise lands us on the grasshopper (since 14 + 11 = 25, and 25 mod 20 = 5, which corresponds to the grasshopper).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: grasshopper."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
