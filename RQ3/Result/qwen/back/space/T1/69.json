Each move changes your position by a certain number of steps in a specified direction. Since the path is circular, moving past the last dot brings you back to the beginning.\n\nStarting from the golf ball, moving 2 steps clockwise means you move to the next two dots in order. The sequence is:\n1. Golf ball (starting point)\n2. Screwdriver\n3. Maze\n\nSo, moving 2 steps clockwise from the golf ball lands you on the maze.\n\nNext, we move 2 steps counter-clockwise from the maze. Moving counter-clockwise means moving backwards through the sequence. The sequence going backwards is:\n1. Maze (current position)\n2. Screwdriver\n3.
