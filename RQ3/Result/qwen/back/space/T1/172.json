The circular path consists of 20 dots.\n2. Each step moves you to the next dot in a clockwise direction.\n3. Moving 20 steps is equivalent to completing one full circle since there are 20 dots in total.\n\nStarting from the Arctic fox, moving 20 steps in a clockwise direction means you will end up exactly where you started because 20 steps cover the entire circumference of the circle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Arctic fox"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
