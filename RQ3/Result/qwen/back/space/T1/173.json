The circular path consists of 20 dots, and we need to calculate the net movement in terms of steps around the circle. We can do this by summing up all the movements, taking into account their directions (clockwise or counter-clockwise). \n\nSince moving counter-clockwise is effectively subtracting steps and moving clockwise is adding steps, we can summarize the movements as follows:\n\n- 6 steps counter-clockwise = -6 steps\n- 2 steps clockwise = +2 steps\n- 5 steps counter-clockwise = -5 steps\n- 10 steps counter-clockwise = -10 steps\n\nSumming these gives us a net movement of:\n-6 + 2 - 5 - 10 = -19 steps\n\nSince the path has 20 dots, moving -19 steps is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (because -19 mod 20 = 1).\n\nStarting from the shower curtain and moving 1 step clockwise brings us to the next dot, which contains the sea lion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: sea lion"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
