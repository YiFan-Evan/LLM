Since we are moving counter-clockwise, each step will take us backwards in the list.\n\nWe start at the badger and move counter-clockwise:\n\n1. The initial position is the badger.\n2. Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - 1 step back takes us to the American alligator.\n   - 2 steps back takes us to the monastery.\n   - 3 steps back takes us to the cliff.\n   - 4 steps back takes us to the four-poster bed.\n   - 5 steps back takes us to the stone wall.\n   - 6 steps back takes us to the pizza.\n\nSo after the first movement, we are at the pizza.\n\n3.
