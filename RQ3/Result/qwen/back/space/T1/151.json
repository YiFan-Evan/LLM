Calculate the total number of steps moved in the counter-clockwise direction.\n3. Determine the final position based on the total steps moved.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Position**:\n   - The problem states that we start from the umbrella. According to the list provided, the umbrella is the 5th element in the clockwise direction from the top (sunglass).\n\n2. **Calculate Total Steps Moved**:\n   - We move 18 steps counter-clockwise initially.\n   - Then we move 2 more steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Therefore, the total steps moved counter-clockwise is \\(18 + 2 = 20\\) steps.\n\n3. **Determine the Final Position**:\n   - Since the path consists of 20 dots, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from any point brings us back to the same starting point due to the circular nature of the path.\n   - Hence, after moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from the umbrella, we end up back at the umbrella.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: umbrella"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
