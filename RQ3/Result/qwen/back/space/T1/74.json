Move 5 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - From position 3, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise lands us at position 3 - 5 = -2. Since we can't have negative positions, we adjust by adding 10 (the total number of positions):\n     -2 + 10 = 8.\n   - So, after the first movement, we are at position 8, which is the paddle wheel.\n\n2. Move 1 step clockwise:\n   - From position 8, moving 1 step clockwise lands us at position 8 + 1 = 9.\n   - So, after the second movement, we are at position 9, which is the gossamer-winged butterfly.\n\n3. Move 8 steps clockwise:\n   - From position 9, moving 8 steps clockwise lands us at position 9 + 8 = 17. \n   - To find the actual position on our 10-dot circle, we take the remainder when 17 is divided by 10:\n     17 % 10 = 7.\n   - So, after the third movement, we are at position 7, which is the snail.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: snail."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
