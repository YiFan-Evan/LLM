Common gallinule\n2. Flat-Coated Retriever\n3. Bolete\n4. Police van\n5. Bee eater\n\nMoving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the bee eater:\n- Moving one step counter-clockwise from the bee eater takes us to the police van.\n- Moving another step counter-clockwise from the police van takes us to the bolete.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: bolete"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
