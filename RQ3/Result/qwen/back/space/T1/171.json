The circular path consists of 20 dots, so every time we complete 20 steps, we return to the starting point.\n\nStarting position after moving from the initial cloak position to the specified starting point (orangutan):\n- Orangutan is the 17th dot if we count clockwise from the top (cloak).\n\nMovements:\n1. Move 18 steps counter-clockwise from the orangutan.\n   - Counter-clockwise movement subtracts steps, so we move to the 17 - 18 = -1 position. Since we can't have a negative position, we add 20 steps (because there are 20 dots in total): -1 + 20 = 19th dot.\n   - The 19th dot is a hermit crab.\n\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise from the hermit crab.\n   - Clockwise movement adds steps, so we move to the 19 + 2 = 21st position. Since there are only 20 dots, we subtract 20 steps: 21 - 20 = 1st dot.\n   - The 1st dot is a cloak.\n\n3. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise from the cloak.\n   - Counter-clockwise movement subtracts steps, so we move to the 1 - 13 = -12 position. Adding 20 steps: -12 + 20 = 8th dot.\n   - The 8th dot is a minibus.\n\n4. Move 17 steps clockwise from the minibus.\n   - Clockwise movement adds steps, so we move to the 8 + 17 = 25th position.
