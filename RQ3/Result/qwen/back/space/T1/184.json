The circular path has 20 dots, so every time we move 20 or a multiple of 20 steps, we end up back at the starting point. \n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n1. Start from the ski mask.\n2. Move 13 steps clockwise. \n3. Move 10 steps clockwise.\n4. Move 5 steps clockwise.\n5. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nWe can simplify the movements by calculating the net movement:\n- Moving 13 steps clockwise and then 13 steps counter-clockwise cancels out to 0 steps.\n- Therefore, we only need to consider the net effect of moving 10 + 5 = 15 steps clockwise.\n\nStarting from the ski mask (which is the 19th dot if we count the chimpanzee as the 1st dot), moving 15 steps clockwise means we move past the monarch butterfly, barrette, jay, ski mask, monarch butterfly, and so forth until we reach the 14th dot.\n\nThe 14th dot contains the fire salamander.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: fire salamander."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
