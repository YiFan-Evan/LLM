Move 6 steps counter-clockwise.\n4. Move 17 steps clockwise.\n5. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nWe can simplify the net movement by summing up the clockwise and counter-clockwise steps separately:\n\n- Net clockwise steps = 8 + 17 - 6 - 7 = 12 steps clockwise.\n- Since the path has 20 dots, moving 20 steps in any direction brings you back to the same spot. Therefore, we can reduce 12 steps modulo 20:\n  - 12 mod 20 = 12.\n\nSo, the net movement is 12 steps clockwise from the starting point (oxygen mask).\n\nStarting from the oxygen mask, let's count 12 steps clockwise:\n1.
