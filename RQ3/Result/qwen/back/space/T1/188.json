Determine the total number of steps moved: First, we move 8 steps clockwise, and then another 12 steps clockwise. This means a total movement of 20 steps clockwise.\n3. Understand the circular nature of the path: Since there are 20 dots (or positions) on the circular path, moving 20 steps clockwise brings us back to the same position we started from.\n\nGiven that the flamingo is our starting point and we have moved a total of 20 steps, which is equivalent to completing one full circle, we end up exactly at the flamingo again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: flamingo"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
