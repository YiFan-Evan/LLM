Move 1 step clockwise: This brings us to the position of a packet (1).\n2. Move 1 step clockwise again: This brings us to the position of a rocking chair (2).\n3. Move 9 steps counter-clockwise: Since we're moving counter-clockwise, subtracting 9 steps from the current position (2) is equivalent to adding 1 step (because -9 mod 10 = 1).
