Understand the sequence of moves: First, 9 steps clockwise, then 6 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n3. Calculate the net movement from the starting point:\n   - Moving 9 steps clockwise means moving forward in the sequence.\n   - Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise means moving backward in the sequence.\n   - Moving 7 more steps counter-clockwise further increases the backward movement.\n4. Determine the final position based on the net movement.\n\nLet's calculate the net movement step-by-step:\n\n- Initial position: Common gallinule (dot 1)\n- Move 9 steps clockwise: From dot 1, move 9 steps to dot 10 (Irish Wolfhound).\n- Move 6 steps counter-clockwise: From dot 10, move 6 steps back to dot 4 (gas mask).\n- Move 7 steps counter-clockwise: From dot 4, move 7 steps back to dot 9 (dam).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: dam"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
