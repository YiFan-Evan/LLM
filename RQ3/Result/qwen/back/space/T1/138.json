Given that the circular path consists of 20 dots, moving N steps counter-clockwise (CCW) is equivalent to moving \\(20 - N\\) steps clockwise (CW). We can summarize the movements as follows:\n\n1. Move 8 steps CCW = Move \\(20 - 8 = 12\\) steps CW.\n2. Move 16 steps CW.\n3. Move 7 steps CCW = Move \\(20 - 7 = 13\\) steps CW.\n4. Move 13 steps CCW = Move \\(20 - 13 = 7\\) steps CW.\n\nAdding these up, the total movement in CW direction is \\(12 + 16 + 13 + 7 = 48\\) steps. Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we can reduce 48 modulo 20 to find the effective number of steps moved CW. \n\n\\[48 \\mod 20 = 8\\]\n\nStarting from the breakwater, we now move 8 steps CW.
