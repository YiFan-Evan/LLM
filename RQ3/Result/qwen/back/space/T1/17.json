This means that after reaching the last element, moving further continues from the beginning again. The circular path consists of 5 distinct items, and movement is quantified in steps.\n\nStarting from the square academic cap, moving 5 steps in a clockwise direction means you will complete a full cycle around the path and end up exactly at the starting point again. The items on the path in clockwise order from the square academic cap are:\n\n1. Remote control (1 step)\n2. Ocean liner (2 steps)\n3. Fox squirrel (3 steps)\n4. Bassinet (4 steps)\n5.
