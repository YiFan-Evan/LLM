Each step represents a move to the next dot in a specified direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n2. Since the map is circular, moving past the last dot brings you back to the first dot.\n3. To calculate the final position, sum up all the movements considering their directions.\n\nStarting from the custard apple, which is our reference point, let's break down the movements:\n\n- First, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise: On a 10-dot circle, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise (since 10 - 8 = 2). So, you end up two steps clockwise from the custard apple.\n- Second, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the new position: From the position two steps clockwise from the custard apple, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise brings you to the starting position, the custard apple (as moving 2 steps clockwise and then 3 steps counter-clockwise lands you one step counter-clockwise from the starting point, but since you started at the custard apple, moving counter-clockwise lands you again at the custard apple).\n- Third, moving 6 steps clockwise from the custard apple: Moving 6 steps clockwise from the custard apple brings you to the great grey owl.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: great grey owl"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
