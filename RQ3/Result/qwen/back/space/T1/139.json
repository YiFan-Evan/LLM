The circular path consists of 20 dots, so moving around the circle involves counting the number of steps and wrapping around when necessary.\n\nStarting from the African bush elephant, which is one of the items on the path, we need to calculate the total movement in steps counter-clockwise and determine the final position based on this movement.\n\n1. First movement: 6 steps counter-clockwise.\n2. Second movement: 14 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nTotal movement = 6 + 14 = 20 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nSince there are 20 dots in the circle, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise brings us back to the starting position, which is the African bush elephant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: African bush elephant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
