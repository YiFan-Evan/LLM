The dots are arranged in the following order (starting from the top and moving clockwise): Four-poster bed, French horn, perfume, strainer, ruffed grouse.\n2. We start at the four-poster bed.\n3. We move 2 steps counter-clockwise. Since we are starting at the four-poster bed, moving counter-clockwise means moving towards the ruffed grouse. Two steps counter-clockwise from the four-poster bed would place us on the strainer.\n4. From there, we move 3 steps clockwise.
