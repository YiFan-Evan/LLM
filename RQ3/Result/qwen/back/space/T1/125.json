The starting point has a house finch.\n2. Movements:\n   - Clockwise by 8 steps.\n   - Counter-clockwise by 15 steps.\n   - Counter-clockwise by 6 steps.\n   - Counter-clockwise by 3 steps.\n\nNet movement calculation:\n- Clockwise movements = +8 steps.\n- Counter-clockwise movements = -15 - 6 - 3 = -24 steps.\n\nNet movement = 8 - 24 = -16 steps (which means moving 16 steps counter-clockwise).\n\n3. Since the map is circular with 20 dots, moving 16 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 4 steps clockwise (because 20 - 16 = 4). So we move 4 steps clockwise from the house finch.\n\n4. Now, let's determine the final position:\n   - House finch -> (8 steps clockwise) -> Appenzeller Sennenhund.\n   - But we move 4 steps clockwise instead of 8, so the correct sequence is:\n     House finch -> Red panda -> Fly -> Alpine ibex -> Mobile phone.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: mobile phone."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
