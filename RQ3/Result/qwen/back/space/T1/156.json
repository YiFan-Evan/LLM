The circular path has 20 dots, so moving 20 steps in any direction brings us back to the same spot. We can calculate the net movement by summing up all the steps, considering the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise). A clockwise movement is considered positive, while a counter-clockwise movement is negative.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n1. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise: -7 steps.\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise: +2 steps.\n3. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: -3 steps.\n4. Move 15 steps clockwise: +15 steps.\n\nSumming these movements gives us the total movement:\n-7 + 2 - 3 + 15 = 7 steps clockwise.\n\nStarting from the drilling rig, which is the second dot on the path (as the plate is at the top and the drilling rig follows immediately after in a clockwise direction), moving 7 steps clockwise lands us on the coho salmon.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: coho salmon."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
