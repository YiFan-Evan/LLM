Move 1 step clockwise.\n2. Move 1 step counter-clockwise.\n3. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise.\n4. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n5. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nThe net movement is calculated as follows:\n- Clockwise movement: +1 step.\n- Counter-clockwise movements: -1 - 5 - 7 - 3 = -16 steps.\n\nCombining these movements:\nNet movement = +1 - 16 = -15 steps.\n\nSince the path is circular with 10 dots, we take the net movement modulo 10:\n-15 mod 10 = -15 + 2*10 = -15 + 20 = 5 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nStarting from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier and moving 5 steps counter-clockwise, the sequence of items encountered is:\nSoft-coated Wheaten Terrier -> Fiddler Crab -> Cheeseburger -> Chime -> Magpie -> Fountain Pen.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: fountain pen."}]
