List the sequence of items in a clockwise direction: Pig (start), Bee, Sock, Smooth Newt, Basset Hound.\n3. Calculate the position after moving 3 steps clockwise from the Basset Hound:\n   - The sequence is: Basset Hound, Pig, Bee, Sock.\n   - Therefore, after 3 steps clockwise from the Basset Hound, you reach the Bee.\n4. Calculate the position after moving 4 steps counterclockwise from the Bee:\n   - Counterclockwise means moving backwards through the sequence.\n   - The sequence backwards from the Bee is: Sock, Smooth Newt, Basset Hound, Pig.\n   - Therefore, after 4 steps counterclockwise from the Bee, you return to the Bee.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Bee"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
