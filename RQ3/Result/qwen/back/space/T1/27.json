Starting at Yorkshire Terrier (position 0):\n   - Moving 1 step clockwise places you at the gong (position 1).\n\n2. From the gong (position 1), moving 2 steps counterclockwise:\n   - Counterclockwise movement effectively moves you backwards on the circle.\n   - Moving 1 step counterclockwise from the gong takes you to the Yorkshire Terrier (position 0).\n   - Moving another step counterclockwise from the Yorkshire Terrier takes you to the maze (position 4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: maze"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
