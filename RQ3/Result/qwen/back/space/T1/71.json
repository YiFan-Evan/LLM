Each step taken can be either clockwise or counter-clockwise, and since the path is circular, moving past the last position brings you back to the first.\n\n1. Start at the dog sled.\n2. Move 9 steps counter-clockwise. Since there are only 10 positions, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (because 9 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 10 - 9 = 1 step clockwise).\n3.
