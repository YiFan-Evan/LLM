The initial position is specified relative to the moving van, but since the movements are described in detail, we can directly use the starting element mentioned, which is the football helmet.\n\nThe sequence of movements involves three steps:\n1. Move 15 steps counter-clockwise.\n2. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n3. Move 20 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nSince the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise will bring you back to the same position. Therefore, we can simplify the total movement by adding up the steps and taking the remainder when divided by 20 (since the path loops back to the beginning every 20 steps).\n\nTotal movement = 15 + 8 + 20 = 43 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nNow, calculate the effective movement by finding the remainder of 43 divided by 20:\n43 % 20 = 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nStarting from the football helmet, we need to count 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nThe sequence of elements starting from the football helmet is:\n1.
