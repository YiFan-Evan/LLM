Given that there are 10 dots on the path and we start at the Afghan Hound, moving 10 steps clockwise means we will complete a full circle and return to the same position we started from because 10 steps on a 10-dot path bring us back to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Afghan Hound"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
