Move 2 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Counter-clockwise means moving against the direction (tiger -> Welsh Springer Spaniel -> velvet).\n   - Moving 2 steps from the Welsh Springer Spaniel, we land on the tiger.\n3. Move 5 steps clockwise from the tiger:\n   - Clockwise means moving with the direction (tiger -> velvet -> switch -> stopwatch -> Welsh Springer Spaniel).\n   - Since the path is circular and has 5 dots, moving 5 steps will bring us back to the starting point, which is the tiger again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: tiger"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
