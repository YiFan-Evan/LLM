The circular path consists of 20 distinct positions (dots). Each step moves you to the next dot in a clockwise direction. When you reach the end of the circle, you loop back to the beginning.\n\nStarting from the photocopier, let's calculate the final position:\n\n1. You start at the photocopier.\n2. Moving 14 steps clockwise: Since there are 20 dots, moving 14 steps from the photocopier means you will land on the dot that is 14 steps away from the photocopier. To find the exact dot, we can use modulo arithmetic. \\(14 \\mod 20 = 14\\), so you land on the dot 14 steps away from the photocopier.\n3. Identify the item 14 steps clockwise from the photocopier: Counting 14 steps clockwise from the photocopier, the sequence of items is:\n   - Photocopier (starting point)\n   - Military cap\n   - White-headed capuchin\n   - Eastern diamondback rattlesnake\n   - Jackfruit\n   - Monarch butterfly\n   - Cowboy hat\n   - Jaguar\n   - Vase\n   - Bookcase\n   - Gong\n   - Abacus\n   - Plow\n   - Sunscreen\n\nSo, 14 steps from the photocopier lands you on the sunscreen.\n\n4. Now, from the sunscreen, you move 6 more steps clockwise: \n   - Sunscreen (starting point for this movement)\n   - Ballpoint pen\n   - Sports car\n   - Cleaver\n   - Honeycomb\n   - Horizontal bar\n\nSo, 6 steps from the sunscreen lands you on the horizontal bar.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: horizontal bar."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
