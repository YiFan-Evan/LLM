Since the map consists of 20 connected dots and we are moving in a counter-clockwise direction, we need to determine the new position after moving 20 steps back from the starting point, which is the Pickelhaube.\n\nGiven that there are 20 dots, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise will bring us back to the same starting dot due to the circular nature of the path.
