We are instructed to move from the Cradle:\n   - First, move 2 steps clockwise from the Cradle.\n   - Then, move 3 more steps clockwise from the new position.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n- Initially standing on the Schooner.\n- Identify the starting point for the movements: the Cradle.\n- Moving 2 steps clockwise from the Cradle lands us on the Garter Snake.\n- From the Garter Snake, moving 3 more steps clockwise brings us back to the Night Snake (since we loop around the circle).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Night Snake."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
