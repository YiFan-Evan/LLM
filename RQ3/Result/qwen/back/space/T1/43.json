The circular path consists of 10 distinct positions, so every movement can be reduced to a position within these 10 spots by using modulo arithmetic (since moving 10 steps in any direction brings you back to the same spot).\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n1. Starting point is the soccer ball.\n2. Move 6 steps clockwise: Soccer ball -> Knee pad -> Jeans -> Promontory -> Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier -> Half-track -> Carousel.\n3. Then, move 9 steps counterclockwise: Carousel -> (back to) Soccer ball -> Knee pad -> Jeans -> Promontory -> Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier -> Half-track -> (back to) Soccer ball -> Knee pad.\n4.
