The circular path consists of 20 dots, so each movement corresponds to a specific number of positions backwards along the path.\n\nStarting from the Afghan Hound, the total counter-clockwise movement can be calculated as follows:\n\n- First movement: 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n- Second movement: 15 steps counter-clockwise.\n- Third movement: 13 steps counter-clockwise.\n- Fourth movement: 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nSumming these movements gives us the total counter-clockwise movement:\n13 + 15 + 13 + 8 = 49 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nSince the path has 20 dots, moving 49 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 49 mod 20 steps, which is 9 steps (because 49 divided by 20 leaves a remainder of 9).\n\nNow, starting from the Afghan Hound and moving 9 steps counter-clockwise, we count backwards along the list provided:\n1. Afghan Hound\n2. Bell-cot\n3. Pelican\n4. Cockroach\n5. Newt\n6. Flagpole\n7. Revolver\n8. Tabby cat\n9.

The circular path consists of 20 dots, and we need to account for both clockwise and counter-clockwise movements.\n\nStarting from the Afghan Hound, let's calculate the net movement step-by-step:\n\n1. Start at the Afghan Hound.\n2. Move 1 step clockwise: This moves you to the next dot, which is the bell-cot.\n3. Move 1 step counter-clockwise: This brings you back to the Afghan Hound.\n4. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise: This moves you 13 steps back, landing you at the snow leopard.\n5. Move 15 steps counter-clockwise: This moves you 15 steps back, landing you at the stove.\n6. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise: This moves you 13 steps back, landing you at the hot dog.\n7. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise: This moves you 8 steps back, landing you at the trench coat.\n\nThe net effect of all these movements can be summarized as follows:\n- Clockwise movements: 1 step\n- Counter-clockwise movements: 1 + 13 + 15 + 13 + 8 = 40 steps\n\nSince the path has 20 dots, moving 40 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 40 mod 20 steps, which is 0 steps. However, since we also moved 1 step clockwise initially, the net movement is effectively 1 step clockwise from the initial position (the Afghan Hound).\n\nStarting from the Afghan Hound and moving 1 step clockwise lands you on the bell-cot.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: bell-cot."}]
