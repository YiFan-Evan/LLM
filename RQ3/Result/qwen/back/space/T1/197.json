Starting from the mosque (dot 12 if we count from 0), moving 16 steps clockwise lands you on dot 8 (because 12 + 16 = 28, and 28 mod 20 = 8).\n2. From dot 8, moving 18 steps clockwise lands you on dot 6 (because 8 + 18 = 26, and 26 mod 20 = 6).\n3. From dot 6, moving 5 steps clockwise lands you on dot 11 (because 6 + 5 = 11, and 11 mod 20 = 11).\n4. Finally, from dot 11, moving 16 steps clockwise lands you on dot 7 (because 11 + 16 = 27, and 27 mod 20 = 7).\n\nNow, we need to identify what is on dot 7.
