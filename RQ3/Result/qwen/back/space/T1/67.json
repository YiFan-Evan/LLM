Given that there are 10 dots on the circular path, moving 10 steps clockwise would bring us back to the starting point of our current segment of interest.\n\nStarting from the umbrella, which is the second dot on the path, moving 10 steps clockwise means we complete one full circle and end up at the same dot we started from.
