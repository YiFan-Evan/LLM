Determine the sequence of items in the clockwise direction: The items are analog clock, balance beam, toaster, and handkerchief.\n3. Calculate the net movement: Moving 3 steps clockwise and then 4 steps counter-clockwise results in a net movement of 1 step counter-clockwise (since 3 steps clockwise minus 4 steps counter-clockwise equals -1 step or 1 step counter-clockwise).\n4.
