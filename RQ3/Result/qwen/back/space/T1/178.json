Understand the movement directions and calculate the net movement:\n   - Moving 15 steps counter-clockwise: This would take us back 15 positions from the European polecat.\n   - Moving 9 steps clockwise: This would advance us forward 9 positions.\n   - Moving 14 steps clockwise: This would further advance us forward 14 positions.\n   - Moving 20 steps counter-clockwise: This would take us back 20 positions.\n\n3. Calculate the final position based on the total net movement around the circular path of 20 dots.\n\nLet's compute the net movement step-by-step:\n\n- Start at the European polecat.\n- Move 15 steps counter-clockwise: Since the path has 20 dots, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 5 steps clockwise (20 - 15 = 5). So now you are at the hard disk drive.\n- Move 9 steps clockwise: Starting from the hard disk drive, moving 9 steps clockwise takes you to the spider web.\n- Move 14 steps clockwise: From the spider web, moving 14 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 14 - 20 + 20 = 14 steps clockwise (since moving 20 steps would bring you back to the same spot). This takes you to the yurt.\n- Move 20 steps counter-clockwise: Since moving 20 steps counter-clockwise brings you back to the same spot, you remain at the yurt.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: yurt"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
