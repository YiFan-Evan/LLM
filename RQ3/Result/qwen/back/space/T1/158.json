The circular path consists of 20 dots, so every time we move past the 20th dot, we loop back to the beginning. We start from the gas pump and follow the sequence of movements:\n\n1. Move 19 steps counter-clockwise from the gas pump:\n   - Since we're moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 19 from our starting position (which is 8, considering the gas pump is the 8th dot if we count from the mosquito net).\n   - 8 - 19 = -11; since the path is circular with 20 dots, we add 20 to -11 to get the new position.\n   - -11 + 20 = 9.\n\n2. Move 15 steps clockwise from the current position (9):\n   - Add 15 to the current position (9), and then take modulo 20 to stay within the range of the circle.\n   - 9 + 15 = 24; 24 mod 20 = 4.\n\n3. Move 12 steps clockwise from the current position (4):\n   - Add 12 to the current position (4), and then take modulo 20.\n   - 4 + 12 = 16; 16 mod 20 = 16.\n\n4. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the current position (16):\n   - Subtract 5 from the current position (16), and then take modulo 20.\n   - 16 - 5 = 11; 11 mod 20 = 11.\n\nAfter all these movements, you end up at the position that corresponds to the 11th dot.
