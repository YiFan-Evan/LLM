The circular path consists of 20 dots, so any movement can be considered modulo 20. Here\u2019s how we calculate the final position:\n\n1. Start at the tiger beetle.\n2. Move 17 steps clockwise: This brings us to the position (initial position + 17) % 20.\n3. Then move 2 steps clockwise: This brings us to the position ((initial position + 17) % 20 + 2) % 20.\n4. Then move 7 steps counterclockwise: This brings us to the position (((initial position + 17 + 2) % 20 - 7) % 20).\n5. Finally, move 14 steps counterclockwise: This brings us to the position ((((initial position + 17 + 2 - 7) % 20) - 14) % 20).\n\nLet's denote the initial position as P = 12 (since the tiger beetle is the 13th element starting from the partridge, which is at position 0).\n\nPerforming the calculations step-by-step:\n- After moving 17 steps clockwise from position 12: (12 + 17) % 20 = 3\n- After moving 2 steps clockwise from position 3: (3 + 2) % 20 = 5\n- After moving 7 steps counterclockwise from position 5: (5 - 7 + 20) % 20 = 18\n- After moving 14 steps counterclockwise from position 18: (18 - 14 + 20) % 20 = 24 % 20 = 4\n\nThe final position is 4, which corresponds to the fourth element on the circular path starting from the partridge.
