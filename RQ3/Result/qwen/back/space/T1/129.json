Move 19 steps counter-clockwise: \\(13 - 19 = -6 \\mod 20 = 14\\) (since \\(-6 + 20 = 14\\)).\n4. Move 7 steps clockwise: \\(14 + 7 = 21 \\mod 20 = 1\\).\n5. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise: \\(1 - 6 = -5 \\mod 20 = 15\\) (since \\(-5 + 20 = 15\\)).\n\nSo, after all the movements, you end up at position 15, which corresponds to the item located at that position on the circular path.\n\nThe item at position 15 is a French Bulldog.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: French Bulldog."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
