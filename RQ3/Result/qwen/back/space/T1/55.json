Specifically, moving \\(n\\) steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(-n\\) steps clockwise (or \\(10-n\\) steps clockwise since we're working with modulo 10).\n\nStarting position: Tank suit\n\nMovements:\n1. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 5 steps clockwise in the opposite direction, so we move \\(10-5 = 5\\) steps clockwise from the tank suit.\n2. Move 4 steps counter-clockwise: Again, this is equivalent to moving \\(10-4 = 6\\) steps clockwise.\n3. Move 9 steps clockwise: Directly move 9 steps clockwise.\n\nLet's calculate the final position step-by-step:\n\n1. From the tank suit (position 5), moving 5 steps clockwise brings us to position \\(5 + 5 = 10\\), which is the same as position 0 (stone wall).\n2. From the stone wall (position 0), moving 6 steps clockwise brings us to position \\(0 + 6 = 6\\) (alp).\n3. From the alp (position 6), moving 9 steps clockwise brings us to position \\(6 + 9 = 15\\).
