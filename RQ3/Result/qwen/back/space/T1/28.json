The principle here involves understanding circular motion and modular arithmetic since the path loops back to the beginning after the last dot.\n\n1. **Initial Setup**: The circular path consists of 5 dots with the following items in order (starting from the top and moving clockwise): Library, African rock python, Scorpion, Gas pump, Nematode.\n   \n2. **Starting Position**: You begin from the Scorpion. \n\n3. **First Movement (Counter-Clockwise)**: Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 3 from your current position (Scorpion = 3rd position). Since we're working with a circular map, we can use modulo 5 (5 being the total number of dots) to find the new position:\n   - Current Position (Scorpion) = 3\n   - New Position = (3 - 3) mod 5 = 0 (mod 5)\n   - Position 0 corresponds to the Library.\n\n4. **Second Movement (Clockwise)**: From the Library, moving 5 steps clockwise means adding 5 to your current position (Library = 1st position):\n   - Current Position (Library) = 1\n   - New Position = (1 + 5) mod 5 = 6 mod 5 = 1\n   - Position 1 corresponds again to the Library.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Library"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
