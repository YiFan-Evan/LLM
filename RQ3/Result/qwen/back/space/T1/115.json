The circular path consists of 10 distinct positions, so every time we move past the 10th position, we loop back to the beginning.\n\nThe positions on the path, starting from the top (which has an ear), going clockwise, are:\n1. Ear\n2. Mantis\n3. Pomegranate\n4. Threshing Machine\n5. Screw\n6. Loupe\n7. Microphone\n8. Parking Meter\n9. Kit Fox\n10. Paddle Wheel\n\nWe start from the mantis, which is position 2.

Move 8 steps counter-clockwise from the parking meter (position 8):\n   - Since moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving forward in reverse order, we can also think of this as moving 2 steps clockwise because 10 - 8 = 2 (since we loop back around the circle).\n   - Position 8 \u2192 9 (Kit Fox) \u2192 10 (Paddle Wheel)\n   - Final position after 8 steps counter-clockwise: 10 (Paddle Wheel)\n\n3.
