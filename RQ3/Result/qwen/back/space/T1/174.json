Given that the path consists of 20 connected dots, moving a certain number of steps is equivalent to adding or subtracting that number from the current position (modulo 20).\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n1. We start from the crate.\n2. Moving 16 steps clockwise means adding 16 to the starting position.\n3. Then, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 19 from the current position.\n4. Next, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting another 13 from the current position.\n5. Finally, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 5 more from the current position.\n\nThe crate is the 19th element in the sequence (starting from 0 for the tabby cat). Let's calculate the final position:\n\n1. Start at position 18 (since the crate is the 19th element, counting from 0).\n2. Move 16 steps clockwise: \\(18 + 16 = 34\\), which is equivalent to \\(34 \\mod 20 = 14\\).\n3. Move 19 steps counter-clockwise: \\(14 - 19 = -5\\), which is equivalent to \\(-5 + 20 = 15\\) (since \\(-5 \\mod 20 = 15\\)).\n4. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise: \\(15 - 13 = 2\\).\n5. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: \\(2 - 5 = -3\\), which is equivalent to \\(-3 + 20 = 17\\).\n\nSo, after all these movements, we end up at position 17, which corresponds to the white stork.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: white stork."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
