The circular path consists of 10 connected dots.\n2. Each move in a counter-clockwise direction subtracts the number of steps from the current position.\n3. We need to calculate the net movement from the starting point (shield) and determine the final position on the circle.\n\nStarting from the shield:\n- The sequence of moves is 7 steps, 1 step, and 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n- Net movement = -7 -1 -8 = -16 steps.\n- Since the path is circular with 10 dots, moving -16 steps is equivalent to moving -16 mod 10 steps, which is -6 steps or +4 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\nNow, let's determine the final position:\n- Starting from the shield, moving 4 steps clockwise, the sequence of elements from the shield would be: shield -> totem pole -> Rottweiler -> dough -> cock.\n- Therefore, after 4 steps clockwise from the shield, you will find the cock.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: cock"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
