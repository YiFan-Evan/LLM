The key is to understand how circular motion works and how to calculate positions after a series of moves.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: We start at the dung beetle.\n2. **First Move**: Move 4 steps counter-clockwise. Since the map is circular, moving counter-clockwise means moving backwards. The sequence of dots in counter-clockwise order starting from the dung beetle would be:\n   - Dung beetle -> Soap dispenser -> Sidewinder -> Indigo bunting -> Dung beetle (back to the start after 4 steps).\n   Therefore, after moving 4 steps counter-clockwise, we are back at the dung beetle.\n3. **Second Move**: Again, move 4 steps counter-clockwise. Following the same logic as before, we again move back 4 steps counter-clockwise and end up at the dung beetle.\n4. **Third Move**: Now move 10 steps clockwise. Since there are only 10 positions, moving 10 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving all the way around the circle and ending up back at the starting point.
