The sequence of items moving clockwise from the dog sled would be:\n\n- 0: Dog sled\n- 1: Revolver\n- 2: Barn\n- 3: Red-breasted merganser\n- 4: Promontory\n- 5: Asian elephant\n- 6: Spotted salamander\n- 7: Church\n- 8: Birdhouse\n- 9: Bassoon\n\nStarting at position 0 (the dog sled), we perform the following movements:\n1. Move 9 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise because moving 9 steps counter-clockwise in a 10-dot circle brings you back 1 step from where you started (since 10 - 9 = 1). So, you move to position 1.\n2. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: From position 1, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise lands you at position 9.\n3.
