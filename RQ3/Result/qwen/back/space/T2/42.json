Each dot is equally spaced, and moving around the circle means we return to the starting point after 10 steps.\n\n1. First, identify the starting position: The valley.\n2. Move 3 steps clockwise from the valley:\n   - Valley -> Earth star (1 step)\n   - Earth star -> Harvestman (2 steps)\n   - Harvestman -> English Springer Spaniel (3 steps)\n   So, after moving 3 steps clockwise, you are now standing at the English Springer Spaniel.\n3. Next, move 10 steps counterclockwise from the English Springer Spaniel:\n   Since the path is circular and has 10 dots, moving 10 steps counterclockwise is equivalent to moving 0 steps or staying in the same place.
