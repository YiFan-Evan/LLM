Given that the path consists of 10 dots, moving counter-clockwise by 10 steps essentially brings us back to the starting position on the circle because 10 steps on a 10-dot circular path is equivalent to one full rotation.\n\nThe sequence of items in clockwise order from the top (starting point of the drum) is:\n1.
