The approach involves calculating the net movement by summing up all the individual movements and then determining the final position based on the modulo operation with the number of dots (20).\n\nThe initial position is at the green mamba. We then calculate the net movement:\n\n- First movement: +15 steps clockwise.\n- Second movement: -6 steps counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to +14 steps clockwise (since moving 6 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 14 steps clockwise on a 20-dot circle).\n- Third movement: +17 steps clockwise.\n- Fourth movement: +10 steps clockwise.\n\nSumming these movements:\n15 (clockwise) + 14 (clockwise) + 17 (clockwise) + 10 (clockwise) = 56 steps clockwise.\n\nNow, we calculate the final position by taking the total steps modulo 20:\n56 mod 20 = 16.\n\nStarting from the green mamba and moving 16 steps clockwise, we count along the path:\n\n1.
