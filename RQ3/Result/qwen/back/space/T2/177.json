The idea is to compute the net movement and then determine the final position based on the starting point.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the net movement:\n\n- Clockwise movements: +11 (first movement) + 4 (third movement) = +15\n- Counter-clockwise movements: -17 (second movement) - 5 (fourth movement) = -22\n\nNow, summing these gives us the net movement:\n\\[ \\text{Net Movement} = 15 - 22 = -7 \\]\n\nSince moving counter-clockwise is represented by negative values, a net movement of -7 means moving 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nStarting from the minibus, if we move 7 steps counter-clockwise, we need to count backwards from the minibus.
