We'll perform the movements step by step and keep track of our current position.\n\n1. **Starting Position**: The red king crab.\n2. **First Movement (16 steps counter-clockwise)**:\n   - Moving 16 steps counter-clockwise from the red king crab means we subtract 16 from its position index (which is 2, since the red king crab is the second dot).\n   - Starting from the red king crab (position 2), moving 16 steps counter-clockwise brings us to position \\(2 - 16 = -14\\). Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we convert \\(-14\\) to a positive index by adding 20: \\(-14 + 20 = 6\\). So, the new position is the 6th dot (convertible).\n3. **Second Movement (4 steps clockwise)**:\n   - Moving 4 steps clockwise from the 6th dot (convertible) means we add 4 to its position index (which is 6).\n   - \\(6 + 4 = 10\\). So, the new position is the 10th dot (ladle).\n4. **Third Movement (13 steps clockwise)**:\n   - Moving 13 steps clockwise from the 10th dot (ladle) means we add 13 to its position index (which is 10).\n   - \\(10 + 13 = 23\\). Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we take \\(23 \\mod 20 = 3\\). So, the new position is the 3rd dot (ear).\n5. **Fourth Movement (4 steps counter-clockwise)**:\n   - Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the 3rd dot (ear) means we subtract 4 from its position index (which is 3).\n   - \\(3 - 4 = -1\\). Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we convert \\(-1\\) to a positive index by adding 20: \\(-1 + 20 = 19\\). So, the new position is the 19th dot (brain coral).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: brain coral"}]
