Identify the starting position: The otter is located at the top of the path, which corresponds to the first element (going clockwise) in the sequence.\n2. Determine the positions after each movement:\n   - First movement: 3 steps counter-clockwise from the otter.\n   - Second movement: 7 steps clockwise from the new position.\n   - Third movement: 11 steps clockwise from the new position.\n   - Fourth movement: 9 steps counter-clockwise from the new position.\n\nThe circular path consists of 20 dots, so moving in a counter-clockwise direction subtracts the number of steps from the current position, while moving clockwise adds the number of steps to the current position. If the result is beyond the total number of dots, we use modulo operation to wrap around the circle.\n\nLet's calculate the final position step-by-step:\n\n- Initial position: Otter (position 0)\n- After 3 steps counter-clockwise: \\(0 - 3 = -3\\). Since -3 is negative, we add 20 to get the equivalent positive position: \\(-3 + 20 = 17\\).\n- After 7 steps clockwise: \\(17 + 7 = 24\\). Since 24 exceeds 20, we take \\(24 \\mod 20 = 4\\).\n- After 11 steps clockwise: \\(4 + 11 = 15\\).\n- After 9 steps counter-clockwise: \\(15 - 9 = 6\\).\n\nNow, let's determine what is at position 6 based on the given sequence of items:\n1.
