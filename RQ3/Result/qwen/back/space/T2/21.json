Seashore\n\nFirst movement: Move 3 steps clockwise from the \"Hoop Skirt\" (position 4). This places us at:\n- Position 4 + 3 = Position 7. Since there are only 5 positions, we use modulo operation: 7 mod 5 = 2.\nThus, after the first movement, we are at position 2, which corresponds to the \"Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\"\n\nSecond movement: Move 4 steps clockwise from the \"Staffordshire Bull Terrier\" (position 2).
