We know there are five positions, which we can label as follows (starting from the top and moving clockwise):\n   - Position 1: Common Gallinule\n   - Position 2: Flat-Coated Retriever\n   - Position 3: Bolete\n   - Position 4: Police Van\n   - Position 5: Bee Eater\n\n2. The starting point is not directly relevant because the movement instructions are clear and absolute. You start from the Bee Eater (Position 5).\n\n3. Moving counter-clockwise means moving in the opposite direction of the clockwise sequence. Therefore, moving two steps counter-clockwise from the Bee Eater (Position 5) would take us to:\n   - First step counter-clockwise: Position 4 (Police Van)\n   - Second step counter-clockwise: Position 3 (Bolete)\n\n4. Since the question specifies moving around the ring twice by two steps counter-clockwise, the net effect is still the same as moving four steps counter-clockwise from the Bee Eater. This is equivalent to moving one step clockwise from the Bee Eater (since moving four steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving one step clockwise in a five-dot circular path).\n\n5. Moving one step clockwise from the Bee Eater (Position 5) lands us back at Position 1 (Common Gallinule).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Common Gallinule"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
