Here\u2019s how we can do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Position**: The initial position is the tiger beetle.\n2. **Track Movements**:\n   - First movement: Move 17 steps clockwise.\n   - Second movement: Move 2 steps clockwise.\n   - Third movement: Move 7 steps counter-clockwise (equivalent to moving 13 steps clockwise because \\(20 - 7 = 13\\)).\n   - Fourth movement: Move 14 steps counter-clockwise (equivalent to moving 6 steps clockwise because \\(20 - 14 = 6\\)).\n\n3. **Sum Up All Movements**: Combine all movements in the clockwise direction:\n   - \\(17 + 2 + 13 + 6 = 38\\) steps clockwise.\n   \n4. **Calculate Final Position**: Since the path has 20 dots, moving 38 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(38 \\mod 20 = 18\\) steps clockwise.\n\n5. **Determine Final Dot**: Starting from the tiger beetle, move 18 steps clockwise. The sequence of dots from the tiger beetle is:\n   - Tiger beetle -> Parachute -> Dowitcher -> Black-footed ferret -> Tiger beetle -> Beagle -> Killer whale -> Granny Smith -> Bedlington Terrier -> Stick insect -> Green iguana -> Samoyed -> Partridge -> Black and Tan Coonhound -> Tank -> Windsor tie -> Sports car -> Tiger beetle\n\n   Moving 18 steps clockwise from the tiger beetle lands us on the Samoyed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Samoyed"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
