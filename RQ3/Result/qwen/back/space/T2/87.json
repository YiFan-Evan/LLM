Since there are only 10 items, we count 11 - 10 = 1 step further, landing us back at the stupa.\n- From the stupa (9th item), moving 2 steps clockwise brings us to the dam (10th item).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: dam"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
