Therefore, 15 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to 15 mod 10 = 5 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Starting from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise lands us on the \"fountain pen\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: fountain pen"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
