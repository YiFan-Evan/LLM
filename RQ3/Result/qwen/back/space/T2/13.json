Given that the map is circular, moving in one direction or another will eventually bring you back to your starting point or to another point based on the number of steps taken.\n\nStarting from the sulphur-crested cockatoo (which we can consider as the reference point), the sequence of items in a clockwise direction is:\n1. Sulphur-crested cockatoo\n2. Tusker\n3. Leaf beetle\n4. Husky\n5. Jigsaw puzzle\n\nNow, if you start from the tusker (the second position in the clockwise order) and move 4 steps counter-clockwise, you effectively move to the left in the sequence. Since there are only five positions, moving counter-clockwise from the tusker:\n- 1 step counter-clockwise from tusker lands you at the jigsaw puzzle.\n- 2 steps counter-clockwise from tusker lands you at the husky.\n- 3 steps counter-clockwise from tusker lands you at the leaf beetle.\n- 4 steps counter-clockwise from tusker lands you at the sulphur-crested cockatoo.\n\nSo, after moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the tusker, you are now at the sulphur-crested cockatoo position.\n\nNext, you move 5 steps clockwise from the sulphur-crested cockatoo. Because the map is circular, moving 5 steps is equivalent to moving 0 steps since you'll end up back where you started (a full circle). However, since you've already moved to the sulphur-crested cockatoo position, moving 5 steps clockwise from here will still place you at the same position, which is the sulphur-crested cockatoo.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: sulphur-crested cockatoo"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
