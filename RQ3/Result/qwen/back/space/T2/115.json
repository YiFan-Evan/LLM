Move 6 steps clockwise from the mantis.\n   - The mantis is the second dot.\n   - Moving 6 steps clockwise lands us on the Microphone.\n2. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise from the Microphone.\n   - Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise (since 10 - 8 = 2).\n   - This lands us on the Parking Meter.\n3.
