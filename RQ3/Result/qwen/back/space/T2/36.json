The circular path consists of five distinct items (Weimaraner, football helmet, chainsaw, black swan, and bagel). Since the path is circular, moving a number of steps equal to or greater than the total number of items will bring us back to the starting point, effectively completing full loops around the path.\n\nStarting from the black swan and moving 5 steps in a clockwise direction means we complete one full loop of the circle (which has 5 items) and end up exactly where we started.
