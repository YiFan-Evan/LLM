The key principle here is that moving in a circular path means that once you reach the end of the path, you continue from the beginning again (i.e., the path loops back).\n\n1. **Starting Position**: You start at the lion.\n2. **First Movement**: Move 17 steps counter-clockwise. Since there are 20 dots, moving 17 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 3 steps clockwise (because \\(20 - 17 = 3\\)).\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 8 steps counter-clockwise. This is straightforward since there are no adjustments needed for this movement.\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 8 steps clockwise.\n\nNow let's break down these movements:\n\n- From the lion, moving 3 steps clockwise lands you on the analog clock.\n- From the analog clock, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the barometer.\n- From the barometer, moving 8 steps clockwise lands you on the high-speed train.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: high-speed train."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
