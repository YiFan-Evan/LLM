The circular path consists of 20 dots, so moving 20 steps in any direction will bring you back to the same position.

First movement: 8 steps counter-clockwise \u2192 Position = 0 - 8 = -8 \u2261 12 (mod 20)\n2. Second movement: 16 steps clockwise \u2192 Position = 12 + 16 = 28 \u2261 8 (mod 20)\n3.
