Given that the path consists of 10 dots, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from any point will bring us back to the same point due to the circular arrangement.\n\nStarting from the custard apple, if we move 10 steps counter-clockwise, we effectively circle the entire path and end up back at the custard apple because 10 steps on a path with 10 dots return us to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: custard apple"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
