Identify the starting position: The starting position is at the common redshank.\n2. Determine the total movement in steps: You move 16 steps and then another 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. So the total movement is 16 + 20 = 36 steps.\n3. Understand the circular nature of the path: Since the path consists of 20 dots, moving 36 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 36 mod 20 steps. This is because every 20 steps, you return to the same position.\n4. Calculate the effective movement: 36 mod 20 = 16 steps. Therefore, moving 36 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 16 steps counter-clockwise.\n5.
