Each step involves moving to the next dot in the specified direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise). Since the map is circular, moving past the last dot brings us back to the beginning.\n\nFirst, let's identify the starting position:\n- The European garden spider is located somewhere on the circle. To determine its exact position, we can count the positions from the chest (top of the path).\n- The sequence is: chest, plectrum, knee pad, American bullfrog, fly, necklace, church, killer whale, agama, shoji, English Springer Spaniel, traffic light, thimble, spindle, pelican, European garden spider, shopping cart, black-footed ferret, green iguana, oxygen mask.\n- Counting from the chest to the European garden spider, we find it is the 16th dot.\n\nNext, we perform the movements:\n1. Move 11 steps counter-clockwise from the European garden spider.\n2. Move 11 steps clockwise from the new position.\n\n### Step-by-step Calculation:\n\n1. **Counter-Clockwise Movement**:\n   - Current position: European garden spider (16th dot).\n   - Moving 11 steps counter-clockwise: \\(16 - 11 = 5\\). \n   - Since 5 is positive, we stay within the range of 1 to 20.\n   - Therefore, the new position is the 5th dot, which is a necklace.\n\n2. **Clockwise Movement**:\n   - New position: Necklace (5th dot).\n   - Moving 11 steps clockwise: \\(5 + 11 = 16\\).\n   - Since 16 is within the range of 1 to 20, no adjustment is needed.\n   - Therefore, the final position is the 16th dot, which is the European garden spider again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: European garden spider"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
