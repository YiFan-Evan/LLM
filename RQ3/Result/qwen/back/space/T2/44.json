Each step taken either clockwise or counter-clockwise will change our position on this circle. Since the map is circular, if we move past the starting point, we simply loop back around to the beginning.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n- Start at the trilobite.\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: Since we're moving counter-clockwise (to the left), we go back 2 positions from the trilobite. This lands us at the pirate ship.\n- Move 5 steps clockwise: From the pirate ship, moving 5 steps clockwise lands us at the sea slug.\n- Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: Finally, from the sea slug, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise brings us back to the pirate ship again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: pirate ship"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
