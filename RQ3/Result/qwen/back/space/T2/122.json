From the resulting position, we move 15 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nFirst, let's identify the starting point on the circular path.

Here\u2019s the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Position**: The King Charles Spaniel is the 12th dot in the sequence.\n2. **Move Counter-Clockwise by 15 Steps**: \n   - Moving counter-clockwise from the King Charles Spaniel (12th dot) means we subtract 15 steps from 12.\n   - \\(12 - 15 = -3\\)\n   - Since we can't have a negative index, we wrap around the circle:\n     \\(-3 + 20 = 17\\)\n   - Therefore, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise from the King Charles Spaniel lands us on the 17th dot (spotlight).\n3. **Move Clockwise by 15 Steps from the Spotlight**:\n   - Moving clockwise from the 17th dot (spotlight) means we add 15 steps to 17.\n   - \\(17 + 15 = 32\\)\n   - Wrapping around the circle (since there are 20 dots):\n     \\(32 - 20 = 12\\)\n   - Therefore, moving 15 steps clockwise from the spotlight lands us on the 12th dot (King Charles Spaniel).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: King Charles Spaniel"}]
