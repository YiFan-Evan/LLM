Given that the map is circular with 10 positions, moving clockwise or counter-clockwise involves counting positions around the circle.\n\nStarting at the badger, we need to perform two movements:\n1. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise.\n2. Then move 2 steps clockwise.\n\nFirst, let's establish the positions of the elements relative to the starting point (badger). The sequence of items starting from the badger and moving clockwise is:\n- Badger\n- Plunger\n- Fox Squirrel\n- Schooner\n- Frilled-necked Lizard\n- Scottish Terrier\n- Siberian Husky\n- Alaskan Tundra Wolf\n- Clogs\n- Altar\n\nNow, moving counter-clockwise from the badger:\n1.
