Since the path consists of 20 dots and we are moving 20 steps counter-clockwise, this effectively brings us back to our starting position on the circle because moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from any point on a 20-dot circular path returns us to the same point.\n\nStarting from the Pickelhaube, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise lands us back at the same spot.
