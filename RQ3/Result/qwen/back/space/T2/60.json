Each move can be seen as adding or subtracting steps from the current position, and since the map is circular, we must take into account that moving past the last dot brings us back to the first dot.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n1. Start at the dhole.\n2. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise (backwards): Since we are starting at the dhole, which is the second dot (assuming the pole is the first dot), moving 3 steps counter-clockwise lands us on the dome.\n3. Then, move 1 step clockwise (forwards): From the dome, moving one step clockwise brings us to the Griffon Bruxellois.\n4. Finally, move 3 steps counter-clockwise again: From the Griffon Bruxellois, moving three steps counter-clockwise takes us to the pole.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: pole"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
