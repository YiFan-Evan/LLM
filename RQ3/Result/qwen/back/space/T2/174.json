Move 16 steps clockwise: This brings us to the white stork.\n3. Move 19 steps counter-clockwise: Since there are 20 dots, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 1 step clockwise (because -19 \u2261 1 (mod 20)).\n4. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 7 steps clockwise (because -13 \u2261 7 (mod 20)).\n5. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 15 steps clockwise (because -5 \u2261 15 (mod 20)).\n\nSumming these movements:\n16 (clockwise) + 1 (clockwise) + 7 (clockwise) + 15 (clockwise) = 39 steps clockwise.\n\nSince the path has 20 dots, we can reduce 39 modulo 20:\n39 mod 20 = 19.\n\nStarting from the crate, moving 19 steps clockwise brings us to the Alpine ibex.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Alpine ibex."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
