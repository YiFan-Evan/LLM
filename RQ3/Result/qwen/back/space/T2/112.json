Calculate the final position after moving an additional 6 steps clockwise.\n\nFirst, let's number the dots for clarity, with the limousine at position 5 (as the limousine is the 5th element in the sequence starting from the carousel):\n\n1. Carousel\n2. Macaque\n3. Keeshond\n4. Crane\n5. Limousine\n6. Soccer ball\n7. Miniature Poodle\n8. Baboon\n9. Bell-cot\n10.
