The path consists of 20 distinct positions (dots), labeled with different items. We start from the Asian elephant and perform a sequence of moves:\n\n1. Move 15 steps clockwise.\n2. Move 19 steps counter-clockwise.\n3. Move 7 steps clockwise.\n4. Move 15 steps clockwise.\n\nEach move can be translated into a net movement around the circle. Since moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving backwards on the circle, we can convert all movements to their equivalent clockwise steps:\n\n- Moving 15 steps clockwise is +15 steps.\n- Moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is -19 steps, which is equivalent to +1 step (since -19 mod 20 = 1).\n- Moving 7 steps clockwise is +7 steps.\n- Moving 15 steps clockwise is +15 steps.\n\nNow sum these steps:\n\\[ 15 + 1 + 7 + 15 = 38 \\]\n\nNext, reduce 38 modulo 20 to find the effective number of steps:\n\\[ 38 \\mod 20 = 18 \\]\n\nThis means we effectively move 18 steps clockwise from our starting point, the Asian elephant.
