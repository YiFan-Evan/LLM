Given that the path consists of 5 dots (elements), moving 5 steps in any direction will bring you back to the starting point due to the circular structure.\n\nStarting from the overskirt and moving one step counter-clockwise brings us to the Indian cobra. Then, moving five steps clockwise from the Indian cobra will loop us around the circle back to the same position because the path has only five points. Therefore, we end up at the same dot we started from when considering the counter-clockwise move followed by a full clockwise loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: overskirt"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
