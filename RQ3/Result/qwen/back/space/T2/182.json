The path consists of 20 dots, and moving around the circle means we must account for the wrap-around effect when we exceed the number of dots.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Identify Initial Position**: We start from the knee pad.\n2. **Calculate Movements**:\n    - Move 2 steps counter-clockwise (backwards): This is equivalent to moving 18 steps clockwise (since 20 - 2 = 18).\n    - Move 14 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 6 steps clockwise (since 20 - 14 = 6).\n    - Move 17 steps clockwise.\n    - Move 5 steps clockwise.\n\n3. **Sum Up Movements**:\n    - First movement: 18 steps clockwise.\n    - Second movement: 6 steps clockwise.\n    - Third movement: 17 steps clockwise.\n    - Fourth movement: 5 steps clockwise.\n\n    Total movement in the clockwise direction: \\(18 + 6 + 17 + 5 = 46\\) steps.\n\n4. **Account for Circular Path**:\n    - Since there are 20 dots, every 20 steps bring us back to the same position. Therefore, we can reduce 46 modulo 20: \\(46 \\mod 20 = 6\\). This means we effectively move 6 steps clockwise from our starting position.\n\n5. **Determine Final Position**:\n    - Starting from the knee pad (position 3, considering the Samoyed is position 1 and counting clockwise), moving 6 steps clockwise brings us to position 9.\n    - Position 9 corresponds to the item \"stretcher\" based on the provided sequence.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: stretcher"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Identify the initial position: You start at the power drill, which is the 9th dot in the sequence (counting from the Samoyed).\n\n2. Calculate the total movement:\n   - First movement: 2 steps clockwise.\n   - Second movement: 14 steps clockwise.\n   - Third movement: 17 steps counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to 3 steps clockwise (since 20 - 17 = 3).\n   - Fourth movement: 5 steps counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to 15 steps clockwise (since 20 - 5 = 15).\n\n3. Sum up the movements:\n   - Total movement in the clockwise direction: \\(2 + 14 + 3 + 15 = 34\\) steps.\n\n4. Account for the circular nature of the path:\n   - Since the path has 20 dots, every 20 steps bring you back to the same position. Therefore, we calculate \\(34 \\mod 20 = 14\\). This means you effectively move 14 steps clockwise from your starting position.\n\n5. Determine the final position:\n   - Starting from the power drill (position 9), moving 14 steps clockwise brings you to position 23. Since the path is circular with 20 dots, position 23 is equivalent to position 3 (since 23 - 20 = 3).\n\n6.
