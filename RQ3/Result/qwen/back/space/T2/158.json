The circular path consists of 20 dots, so moving 20 steps in any direction will bring us back to the starting point. We can use modulo arithmetic to handle these circular movements efficiently.\n\nLet's break down the movements step-by-step:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: The starting position is at the gas pump.\n2. **First Movement**: Move 19 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving backwards, so we subtract 19 from our current position (mod 20).\n   - Current position = (position + 20 - 19) % 20 = (position + 1) % 20.\n   - Since we start at the gas pump (which is the 9th dot if we number from 0), our new position is (9 + 1) % 20 = 10 (the 10th dot, which is the duck).\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 15 steps clockwise.\n   - Clockwise is equivalent to moving forwards, so we add 15 to our current position (mod 20).\n   - New position = (10 + 15) % 20 = 5 (the 5th dot, which is the jeans).\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 12 steps clockwise.\n   - Again, moving forwards, we add 12 to our current position (mod 20).\n   - New position = (5 + 12) % 20 = 17 (the 17th dot, which is the leatherback sea turtle).\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Move 5 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Moving backwards, we subtract 5 from our current position (mod 20).\n   - New position = (17 + 20 - 5) % 20 = (17 + 15) % 20 = 2 (the 2nd dot, which is the American lobster).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: American lobster"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
