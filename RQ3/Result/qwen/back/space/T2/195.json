The circular path consists of 20 dots, and we need to track our position after each movement.\n\n1. **Initial Position**: We start at the sundial.\n2. **First Movement**: Move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 3 from the initial position (sundial). If the sundial is the 5th element (assuming the Bedlington Terrier is the 1st element), then the new position is the 2nd element (5 - 3 = 2).\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 15 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Now we are at the 2nd element (Tibetan Terrier). Moving 15 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 15 from 2. This results in a negative number, so we add 20 to get the correct position on the circle: 2 - 15 + 20 = 7. So, we are now at the 7th element (bell-cot).\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 14 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Now we are at the 7th element (bell-cot). Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 14 from 7. Again, we get a negative number, so we add 20: 7 - 14 + 20 = 13. So, we are now at the 13th element (spider web).\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Move 16 steps clockwise.\n   - Now we are at the 13th element (spider web). Moving 16 steps clockwise means adding 16 to 13. Since we have 20 elements, we can simplify this by calculating modulo 20: 13 + 16 = 29, and 29 mod 20 = 9. So, we are now at the 9th element (jay).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: jay"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
