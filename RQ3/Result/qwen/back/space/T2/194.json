Start at the bow.\n2. Move 15 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 5 steps clockwise (since 20 - 15 = 5).\n3. Then move 16 steps clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 16 - 20 = -4 steps, or 16 steps clockwise is 4 steps clockwise (since -4 + 20 = 16).\n4. Then move 9 steps clockwise: 9 steps clockwise.\n5.
