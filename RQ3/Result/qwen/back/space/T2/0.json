The circular path consists of 5 dots, and each movement can be tracked by counting the steps taken from the starting point.\n\n1. First, identify the starting point after the described movements:\n   - We start at the mortar.\n   - Moving 4 steps clockwise from the mortar: The sequence is [mortar, four-poster bed, screw, barn, brambling]. So, moving 4 steps clockwise from the mortar lands us at the brambling.\n   - Then, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the brambling: Counting backwards from brambling, we get [brambling, barn, screw, four-poster bed, mortar]. Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the brambling brings us back to the mortar.\n\n2.
