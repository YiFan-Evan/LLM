The circular path has 20 dots, so every time we complete 20 steps, we return to the starting point.\n\n1. Start at the apron.\n2. Move 1 step clockwise: The next dot is a custard apple.\n3. Move 6 steps clockwise: Starting from custard apple, moving 6 steps clockwise lands us on a flatworm.\n4. Move 12 steps counter-clockwise: From flatworm, moving 12 steps counter-clockwise means moving 8 steps clockwise (since 12 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to 20 - 12 = 8 steps clockwise).
