Start at the common gallinule.\n2. Move 9 steps clockwise: This would land you at the \"Irish Wolfhound\" (since you move through 9 positions).\n3. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise: Since the path has 10 dots, moving counter-clockwise can be calculated as moving \\(10 - 6 = 4\\) steps clockwise from your current position. Therefore, you move 4 steps clockwise from the Irish Wolfhound, landing you at the \"Dam\".\n4. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise: Again, moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(10 - 7 = 3\\) steps clockwise from your current position.

Each step involves moving either clockwise or counter-clockwise, and we need to use modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the path.\n\n1. **Initial Position:** Lemon\n2. **Move 9 steps counter-clockwise:**\n   - Counter-clockwise means subtracting steps, so we calculate \\( \\text{position} - 9 \\mod 10 \\).\n   - From lemon, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise lands us at the \"Gas Mask\" (since lemon is the 6th dot, and \\( 6 - 9 \\equiv -3 \\equiv 7 \\mod 10 \\)).\n3. **Move 6 steps clockwise:**\n   - Clockwise means adding steps, so we calculate \\( \\text{position} + 6 \\mod 10 \\).\n   - From gas mask, moving 6 steps clockwise lands us at the \"Pill Bottle\" (since gas mask is the 5th dot, and \\( 7 + 6 \\equiv 13 \\equiv 3 \\mod 10 \\)).\n4. **Move 7 steps clockwise:**\n   - Again, we add steps, so we calculate \\( \\text{position} + 7 \\mod 10 \\).\n   - From pill bottle, moving 7 steps clockwise lands us at the \"Grand Piano\" (since pill bottle is the 3rd dot, and \\( 3 + 7 \\equiv 10 \\equiv 0 \\mod 10 \\)).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Grand Piano"}]
