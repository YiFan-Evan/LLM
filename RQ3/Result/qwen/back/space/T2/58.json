The key principles are:\n\n1. **Understanding the Circular Path**: The circular path consists of 10 distinct positions (dots), labeled sequentially from the starting point (great egret).\n2. **Clockwise Movement**: Moving clockwise means moving forward in the sequence.\n3. **Counter-Clockwise Movement**: Moving counter-clockwise means moving backward in the sequence.\n4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the path is circular, any movement that exceeds the number of positions can be simplified using modular arithmetic. For example, moving 10 steps in a circle of 10 positions brings you back to the same position.\n\nThe sequence of positions is as follows:\n1. Great Egret\n2. Chain-link Fence\n3. Toilet Paper\n4. Green Iguana\n5. Snail\n6. Chow Chow\n7. Spaghetti Squash\n8. Pencil Case\n9. Cocktail Shaker\n10. Ptarmigan\n\nStarting from the cocktail shaker (position 9), let's calculate the final position step-by-step:\n\n- Move 2 steps clockwise: \n  \\[\n  9 + 2 = 11 \\quad (\\text{mod } 10) = 1\n  \\]\n  So, you end up at position 1 (Great Egret).\n\n- Move 5 steps clockwise from Great Egret:\n  \\[\n  1 + 5 = 6 \\quad (\\text{mod } 10) = 6\n  \\]\n  So, you end up at position 6 (Chow Chow).\n\n- Move 6 steps counter-clockwise from Chow Chow:\n  \\[\n  6 - 6 = 0 \\quad (\\text{mod } 10) = 10\n  \\]\n  So, you end up at position 10 (Ptarmigan).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Ptarmigan"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.

Calculate the new position after each movement, considering the direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise).\n3. Use modular arithmetic to ensure the position wraps around correctly within the circular path.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n\n**Initial Position:**\n- Starting from the ptarmigan, which is position 10.\n\n**Movements:**\n1. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise:\n   \\[\n   10 - 2 = 8 \\quad (\\text{mod } 10) = 8\n   \\]\n   Position 8 corresponds to the pencil case.\n\n2. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the pencil case:\n   \\[\n   8 - 5 = 3 \\quad (\\text{mod } 10) = 3\n   \\]\n   Position 3 corresponds to the green iguana.\n\n3. Move 6 steps clockwise from the green iguana:\n   \\[\n   3 + 6 = 9 \\quad (\\text{mod } 10) = 9\n   \\]\n   Position 9 corresponds to the cocktail shaker.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is: cocktail shaker"}]
