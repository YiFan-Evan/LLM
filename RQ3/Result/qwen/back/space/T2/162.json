Move 10 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 10 steps backwards in a circular manner.\n2.

Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 2 steps backwards in a circular manner.\n\nLet's perform these calculations:\n\n1. Starting position: Carton\n2. After moving 10 steps counter-clockwise: The position is calculated as (position - 10) mod 20. Since there are 20 positions, moving 10 steps back lands us at the position of the badger.\n3.
