Given that the path consists of 5 dots and you move 5 steps clockwise starting from the Saluki, we can determine the final position by calculating the remainder when the number of steps moved is divided by the total number of dots (5). This is because moving 5 steps on a circular path with 5 dots brings you back to the same position.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- The path has 5 dots.\n- You start at the Saluki.\n- Moving 5 steps clockwise means you complete exactly one full circle and end up back at the Saluki.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Saluki"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
