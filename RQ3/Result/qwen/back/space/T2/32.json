Since the path is circular with 5 dots, moving 5 steps clockwise from any point will bring you back to the same point due to the circular nature and the number of steps equaling the number of dots.\n\nThus, moving 5 steps clockwise from the little blue heron brings you back to the little blue heron.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Little blue heron"}]
