According to the problem, the starting position (top of the path) has a tusker. However, we need to start counting from the swimsuit, which means we need to determine the sequence of items starting from the swimsuit in a clockwise direction.\n\nThe sequence of items in a clockwise direction from the swimsuit is:\n- Swimsuit (starting point)\n- Earth star\n- Tusker\n- Shower cap\n- Angora rabbit\n\nNow, starting from the swimsuit, we move 4 steps clockwise:\n1.
