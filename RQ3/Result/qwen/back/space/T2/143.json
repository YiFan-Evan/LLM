Here's how we do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: You begin at the centipede, which is the 4th dot when counting clockwise from the sleeping bag.\n2. **Move 8 steps clockwise**: \n   - Starting from the centipede (position 4), moving 8 steps clockwise lands you at position \\(4 + 8 = 12\\). The 12th element is the ice cream.\n3. **Move 2 steps clockwise**:\n   - From the ice cream (position 12), moving 2 steps clockwise lands you at position \\(12 + 2 = 14\\). The 14th element is the dugong.\n4. **Move 5 steps counter-clockwise**:\n   - From the dugong (position 14), moving 5 steps counter-clockwise lands you at position \\(14 - 5 = 9\\). The 9th element is the honeycomb.\n5. **Move 16 steps counter-clockwise**:\n   - From the honeycomb (position 9), moving 16 steps counter-clockwise lands you at position \\(9 - 16 = -7\\). Since we are working with a circular path of 20 elements, we adjust by adding 20 to get a positive position within the range: \\(-7 + 20 = 13\\). The 13th element is the rhinoceros beetle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: rhinoceros beetle"}]
