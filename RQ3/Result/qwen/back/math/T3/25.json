Find the indefinite integral of the given function.\n2. Substitute x = 4 into the result obtained from step 1.\n3. Round down the result to get the final integer.\n\nStep 1: Finding the indefinite integral of sin(x).\n\nThe indefinite integral of sin(x) can be found using the basic integral formula for trigonometric functions. The integral of sin(x) dx is -cos(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration. Since the question asks us to exclude the constant C, we will focus on -cos(x) as our indefinite integral.\n\nStep 2: Substituting x = 4 into -cos(x).\n\nSubstituting x = 4 into -cos(x) gives us -cos(4).\n\nStep 3: Evaluating -cos(4) and rounding down.\n\nTo evaluate -cos(4), we need to use the cosine function. Note that the value of 4 radians is approximately 229.183 degrees, which places it in the third quadrant of the unit circle where cosine values are negative. However, for precise calculation, we will use the exact value of cos(4) and then apply the negative sign.\n\nUsing a calculator or computational tool to find the cosine of 4 radians:\ncos(4) \u2248 -0.6536436208636119\n\nThus,\n-cos(4) \u2248 -(-0.6536436208636119) = 0.6536436208636119\n\nStep 3 involves rounding down the result to the nearest integer. Since 0.6536436208636119 is between 0 and 1, rounding down yields 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sin(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will follow the same three steps as before but now with the function sin(x) + x.\n\nStep 1: Finding the indefinite integral of sin(x) + x.\n\nThe indefinite integral can be found by integrating each term separately. \n\n- The integral of sin(x) is -cos(x).\n- The integral of x is \\(\\frac{x^2}{2}\\).\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of sin(x) + x is -cos(x) + \\(\\frac{x^2}{2}\\) + C.
