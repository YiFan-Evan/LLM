In this case, since no weights are specified for the edges, we assume they are unweighted, making BFS a suitable choice.\n\nBFS works by exploring all the vertices of a graph level by level. It starts at the source node (level 0), explores all its neighbors (level 1), then explores all their neighbors (level 2), and so forth, until it finds the destination node. This ensures that when the destination node is found, the path taken is the shortest one because BFS expands equally in all directions.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (7) to it.\n2. Mark the start node as visited to avoid processing it multiple times.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Remove a node from the front of the queue.\n   - If this node is the destination (2), trace back the path from the destination to the start using the parent pointers.\n   - Otherwise, add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited, storing their parent node.\n4. Once the destination is reached, reconstruct the path by tracing back from the destination node to the start node using the parent pointers.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n- Start at node 7.\n- Explore its neighbors: node 4.\n- From node 4, explore its neighbors: node 7 has no more unexplored neighbors.\n- Move to node 4's neighbor, node 7 has no more unexplored neighbors.\n- From node 4, explore its other neighbor: node 7 has no more unexplored neighbors.\n- Node 4 has no more unexplored neighbors.\n- Move to node 7's other neighbors and continue this process until reaching node 2.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can trace the shortest path from node 7 to node 2.\n\nAfter applying BFS, the shortest path from node 7 to node 2 is found to be: 7->4->2\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->4->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [1, 6], [1, 8], [1, 9], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 8], [4, 7], [5, 12], [9, 11], [10, 11]]} The end node: 2 The start node: 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the shortest path from node 7 to node 2 using a breadth-first search (BFS).

Start at the source node (node 7).\n2. Add the source node to a queue and mark it as visited.\n3. Process each node in the queue by visiting all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet.\n4.
