However, for small graphs like the one provided, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS), which is simpler and equally effective since all edges have the same weight.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path using BFS:\n\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. For each neighbor, record the path taken to reach that neighbor.\n4.
