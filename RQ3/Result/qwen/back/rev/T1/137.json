Then visit all their neighbors, and so on.\n4. Track the distance and the path taken to reach each node.\n5. Stop when you reach the target node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 10.\n\n### Step-by-step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [6]\n   - Visited: {}\n   - Path dictionary: {6: [6]}\n\n2. **Dequeue node 6**:\n   - Neighbors of 6: [4, 14]\n   - Add them to the queue and update paths:\n     - Queue: [4, 14]\n     - Path dictionary: {6: [6], 4: [6, 4], 14: [6, 14]}\n\n3. **Dequeue node 4**:\n   - Neighbors of 4: [5, 6]\n   - Node 6 is already visited, skip it.\n   - Add node 5 to the queue and update paths:\n     - Queue: [14, 5]\n     - Path dictionary: {6: [6], 4: [6, 4], 14: [6, 14], 5: [6, 4, 5]}\n\n4. **Dequeue node 14**:\n   - Neighbors of 14: [6, 10]\n   - Node 6 is already visited, skip it.\n   - Add node 10 to the queue and update paths:\n     - Queue: [5, 10]\n     - Path dictionary: {6: [6], 4: [6, 4], 14: [6, 14], 5: [6, 4, 5], 10: [6, 14, 10]}\n\n5. **Dequeue node 5**:\n   - Neighbors of 5: [9, 4]\n   - Nodes 9 and 4 are already visited, skip them.\n\n6. **Dequeue node 10**:\n   - We reached the target node 10.

Initialize the queue with the start node (6).\n2. Mark the start node as visited.\n3. Dequeue a node and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n4. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n5.
