In this case, since all the edges have the same weight (there are no weights provided for the edges), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach a node, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Then explore all their neighbors.\n4.

We have reached our destination node 3 directly.\n\nSince we reached node 3 directly from node 1, there is no need to explore further.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 3 is simply the direct connection between them.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->3"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
