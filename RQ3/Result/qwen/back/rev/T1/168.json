In this scenario, since all edges are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice due to its simplicity and efficiency.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the given source node.\n2. Enqueue the source node into a queue.\n3. Mark the source node as visited.\n4. Dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\n5. For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited yet, enqueue it and mark it as visited.\n6. Continue until the queue is empty or the target node is dequeued.\n7.

Mark node 7 as visited.\n4. Dequeue node 7 and examine its neighbors (only node 20).\n5. Enqueue node 20 and mark it as visited.\n6. Dequeue node 20 and examine its neighbors (node 10 and node 7, but node 7 is already visited).\n7. Enqueue node 10 and mark it as visited.\n8.
