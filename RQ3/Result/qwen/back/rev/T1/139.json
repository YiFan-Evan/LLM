Start at the given start node (node 3).\n2. Explore all neighbors of the current node.\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet, mark it as visited and add it to a queue.\n4.

Use a queue to manage nodes to be explored and a dictionary to track the path from the start node to each node.\n2. **Enqueue**: Add the start node to the queue.\n3. **Explore**: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore its neighbors.\n4. **Mark Visited**: If a neighbor hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it, while updating the path.\n5. **Stop Condition**: Stop when the destination node (node 0) is dequeued.\n\nLet's go through the BFS process:\n\n1. **Start at node 3**.\n2. **Enqueue node 3**.\n3. **Dequeue node 3**, explore its neighbors:\n   - Neighbors of node 3 are [13].\n   - Enqueue node 13.\n4. **Dequeue node 13**, explore its neighbors:\n   - Neighbors of node 13 are [3, 1].\n   - Enqueue node 1 (since 3 is already visited).\n5. **Dequeue node 1**, explore its neighbors:\n   - Neighbors of node 1 are [10, 13, 14].\n   - Enqueue nodes 10 and 14 (since 13 is already visited).\n6. **Dequeue node 10**, explore its neighbors:\n   - Neighbors of node 10 are [1].\n   - Node 1 is already visited, so no action needed.\n7. **Dequeue node 14**, explore its neighbors:\n   - Neighbors of node 14 are [7, 9, 1].\n   - Enqueue nodes 7 and 9 (since 1 is already visited).\n8. **Dequeue node 7**, explore its neighbors:\n   - Neighbors of node 7 are [14].\n   - Node 14 is already visited, so no action needed.\n9. **Dequeue node 9**, explore its neighbors:\n   - Neighbors of node 9 are [8, 11, 14].\n   - Enqueue nodes 8 and 11 (since 14 is already visited).\n10. **Dequeue node 8**, explore its neighbors:\n    - Neighbors of node 8 are [9].\n    - Node 9 is already visited, so no action needed.\n11. **Dequeue node 11**, explore its neighbors:\n    - Neighbors of node 11 are [2, 5, 9].\n    - Nodes 2 and 5 are enqueued (since 9 is already visited).\n12. **Dequeue node 2**, explore its neighbors:\n    - Neighbors of node 2 are [11].\n    - Node 11 is already visited, so no action needed.\n13. **Dequeue node 5**, explore its neighbors:\n    - Neighbors of node 5 are [11].\n    - Node 11 is already visited, so no action needed.\n14. **Dequeue node 4**, explore its neighbors:\n    - Neighbors of node 4 are [6, 12, 9].\n    - Nodes 6 and 12 are enqueued (since 9 is already visited).\n15. **Dequeue node 6**, explore its neighbors:\n    - Neighbors of node 6 are [4].\n    - Node 4 is already visited, so no action needed.\n16. **Dequeue node 12**, explore its neighbors:\n    - Neighbors of node 12 are [4].\n    - Node 4 is already visited, so no action needed.\n17. **Dequeue node 0**, explore its neighbors:\n    - Neighbors of node 0 are [4].\n    - Node 4 is already visited, so no action needed.\n\nWe have reached node 0.
