Since all the edges in the given graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere\u2019s how we apply BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by marking the start node (node 1) as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue the current node and check its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Continue this process until the target node (node 4) is dequeued.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the target node is reached.\n\nLet's go through the BFS step-by-step for the given graph:\n\n- **Step 1**: Start at node 1.\n- **Step 2**: Enqueue node 1. Its neighbors are nodes 4 and 3. Enqueue node 4 and node 3.\n- **Step 3**: Dequeue node 1. Node 4 is the target, so stop here.\n\nSince node 4 was found directly from node 1, no further steps are needed. The shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is simply the direct connection between them.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 7]]} The end node: 4 The start node: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the start node to the end node in an unweighted graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
