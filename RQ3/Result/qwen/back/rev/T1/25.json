BFS is particularly suitable for unweighted graphs as it explores nodes level by level.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start from the source node.\n2. Visit all the neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n4. Record the path leading to each node.\n5. Stop when you reach the target node.\n\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 2.\n2. Explore its neighbors (node 7).\n3.
