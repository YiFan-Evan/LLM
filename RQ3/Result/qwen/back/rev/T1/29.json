In this case, since all edges have equal weight, BFS is a suitable and simpler approach.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using nodes and edges. Each node is connected by an edge to another node.\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This algorithm explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n3. **Queue Data Structure**: BFS uses a queue to keep track of the next nodes to explore.\n4. **Visited Nodes**: To avoid revisiting nodes and getting stuck in cycles, we maintain a list of visited nodes.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Add the source node to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - If the dequeued node is the target node, stop and return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n4. Mark the dequeued node as visited.\n5. Repeat until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\n\n### Applying BFS to the Given Graph:\nStarting Node: 1  \nTarget Node: 3\n\n- Initialize the queue with the starting node: Queue = [1]\n- Mark node 1 as visited: Visited = [1]\n\n**Iteration 1:**\n- Dequeue node 1.\n- Enqueue neighbors of node 1 that are not visited yet: Queue = [6, 7] (Nodes 6 and 7 are neighbors of node 1)\n\n**Iteration 2:**\n- Dequeue node 6.\n- Node 6 is not the target node. No new nodes to enqueue.\n\n**Iteration 3:**\n- Dequeue node 7.\n- Enqueue neighbors of node 7 that are not visited yet: Queue = [4, 2, 3] (Nodes 4, 2, and 3 are neighbors of node 7)\n- Mark node 7 as visited: Visited = [1, 7]\n\n**Iteration 4:**\n- Dequeue node 4.\n- Node 4 is not the target node. No new nodes to enqueue.\n\n**Iteration 5:**\n- Dequeue node 2.\n- Enqueue neighbors of node 2 that are not visited yet: Queue = [3] (Node 3 is a neighbor of node 2)\n- Mark node 2 as visited: Visited = [1, 7, 2]\n\n**Iteration 6:**\n- Dequeue node 3.\n- Node 3 is the target node.

Initialize a queue with the start node (1).\n2. Initialize a dictionary to store the path from the start node to each node.\n3. Perform BFS:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node that hasn't been visited:\n     - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n     - Store the path from the start node to the neighbor.\n     - Enqueue the neighbor.\n4.
