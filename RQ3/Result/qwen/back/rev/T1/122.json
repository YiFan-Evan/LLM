However, given the relatively small size of the graph, we can also solve it through a breadth-first search (BFS) or even by manually tracing the paths.\n\n### Steps for Dijkstra's Algorithm:\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Assign a tentative distance value to every node. Set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\n   - Mark all nodes except the initial node as unvisited. Set the initial node as current.\n   \n2. **Processing**:\n   - For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n   - When we are done considering all the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited.\n   - If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n   - Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node\", and go back to step 2.\n\n### Applying Dijkstra's Algorithm:\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n- Start at node 8.\n- Neighbors of 8: 4, 5, 7, 12.\n- Tentative distances: 8 (0), 4 (1), 5 (infinity), 7 (1), 12 (1).\n- Move to node 4 (smallest tentative distance).\n\nFrom node 4:\n- Neighbors: 7, 9, 8, 14.\n- Tentative distances: 7 (1), 9 (1), 8 (1), 14 (1).\n- Move to node 9 (smallest tentative distance).\n\nFrom node 9:\n- Neighbors: 4, 11.\n- Tentative distances: 4 (2), 11 (2).\n- Move to node 7 (smallest tentative distance).\n\nFrom node 7:\n- Neighbors: 6, 10.\n- Tentative distances: 6 (2), 10 (2).\n- Move to node 12 (smallest tentative distance).\n\nWe have reached the destination node 12 with a distance of 1.
