In this scenario, since the graph provided does not specify any weights for the edges, we can assume all edges have equal weight. Thus, we can use BFS, which is simpler and more efficient for unweighted graphs.\n\nBFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path from the starting node.
