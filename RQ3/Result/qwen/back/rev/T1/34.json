Mark this node as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node (4). If it is, stop and trace back the path. Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue until the target node is found or all nodes are visited.\n\nLet's apply these steps to our graph:\n\n- Start at node 5.\n- From node 5, the only connected node is 2.\n- From node 2, the connected nodes are 0 and 4. Since we're looking for node 4, we stop here.\n\nNow let's trace back the path:\n- We reached node 4 from node 2.\n- Node 2 was reached from node 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->2->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 7], [6, 7]]} The end node: 4 The start node: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
