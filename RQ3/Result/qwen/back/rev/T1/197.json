Since all the edges in this graph have equal weight (i.e., there is no distinction in the cost of traversing one edge over another), BFS is an appropriate choice.\n\nBFS works by exploring all the neighbors of a given node before moving on to the next level of nodes. This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest possible path from the starting node.\n\nGiven the graph and the nodes:\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\n- Edges: [[0, 10], [0, 1], [1, 14], [1, 15], [2, 3], [3, 17], [3, 21], [4, 14], [5, 7], [5, 9], [6, 22], [6, 10], [7, 13], [8, 12], [8, 9], [9, 24], [10, 19], [10, 16], [11, 24], [13, 18], [13, 15], [13, 23], [16, 21], [20, 24]]\n- Start node: 1\n- Destination: 22\n\nWe will perform BFS starting from node 1 and trace back the path to node 22:\n\n1.

Initialize a queue and add node 1 to it. Also, maintain a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each node visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node, explore its neighbors. For each neighbor not yet visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it while recording its parent.\n3. **Termination**: Stop when the destination node (node 22) is dequeued.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the path:\n\n1. Start at node 1.\n2. Enqueue nodes 14 and 15 (neighbors of node 1).\n3. Dequeue node 14 and enqueue its neighbors (nodes 4 and 10).\n4. Dequeue node 15 and enqueue its neighbors (node 1 and node 13).\n5.
