One such algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm, which works well for graphs with non-negative edge weights.

This ensures that the shortest path is found first.\n4. **Track Path**: Maintain a dictionary or similar structure to track the path from the source to each node.\n5. **Stop Condition**: Stop when the target node (2) is reached.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n- Begin at node 21.\n- Visit its neighbors (8, 22).\n- From there, continue visiting their neighbors until reaching node 2.\n\nLet's trace through the BFS process:\n\n1.
