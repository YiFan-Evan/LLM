Here are the key steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Assign a tentative distance value to every node. Set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. Mark all nodes as unvisited.\n\n2. **Current Node Selection**: Set the initial node as the current node. \n\n3. **Distance Update**: For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n\n4. **Node Marking**: Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\n\n5. **Next Node Selection**: Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node\", and go back to step 3.\n\nWe continue this process until we visit the destination node or all nodes have been visited.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n- Start at node 9.\n- The neighbors of node 9 are 6 and 8.\n- From node 6, we can reach node 5, which leads to node 4, and node 4 leads to node 7 directly.
