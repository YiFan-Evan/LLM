In this case, since all the edges have the same weight (no weights are given), BFS is an appropriate choice because it explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex.\n\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works:\n1. Start by adding the starting node to a queue.\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and check if it is the target node.\n4. If it is not the target node, add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited.\n5. Repeat until the target node is found or the queue becomes empty.\n\nNow, let's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 11 to node 2.\n\nStarting BFS:\n1. Enqueue node 11 and mark it as visited.\n2. Dequeue node 11, check its neighbors [13, 22]. Add these to the queue and mark them as visited.\n3. Dequeue node 13, no further action needed since we're looking for node 2.\n4. Dequeue node 22, check its neighbors [0, 11, 5]. Node 5 is already visited, so add neighbor 0 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n5. Continue dequeuing nodes and exploring neighbors until node 2 is found.\n\nFollowing the BFS process, we can trace back the shortest path:\n\n- Node 11 connects to nodes 13 and 22.\n- Node 22 connects to nodes 0 and 5.\n- Node 5 connects to nodes 22 and 12.\n- Node 12 connects to nodes 2, 16, 18, and 21.\n- Finally, node 2 is found directly connected from node 12.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 11 to node 2 is: 11->22->5->12->2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 11->22->5->12->2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 22], [1, 10], [1, 23], [2, 16], [2, 12], [2, 14], [3, 17], [4, 23], [4, 24], [5, 22], [5, 12], [6, 21], [7, 12], [8, 20], [9, 14], [10, 14], [11, 13], [11, 22], [12, 18], [12, 21], [14, 15], [14, 19], [17, 20], [17, 19]]} The end node: 2 The start node: 11"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 11 to node 2 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
