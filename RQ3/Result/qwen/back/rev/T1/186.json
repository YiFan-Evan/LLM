This algorithm is designed for graphs with non-negative weights and finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes.\n\nHere are the steps involved in Dijkstra's algorithm:\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every node. Set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\n2. Set the initial node as current. Mark all other nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes.\n3. For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n4. When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new current node, and go back to step 3.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given graph:\n\n1.
