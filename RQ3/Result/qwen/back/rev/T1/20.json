Both algorithms aim to find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges between two points.\n\nGiven that the graph is unweighted, BFS is a straightforward and efficient choice for finding the shortest path. Here\u2019s how BFS works:\n\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore its neighbors.\n3. Mark the explored nodes with their distance from the start node.\n4.

BFS is ideal for unweighted graphs because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is visited, it is via the shortest path from the start node.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the BFS algorithm applied to this problem:\n\n1. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Start at node 6.\n   - Create a queue and add the start node (6) to it.\n   - Maintain a visited dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their predecessors.\n\n2. **BFS Execution:**\n   - Dequeue a node and explore its neighbors.\n   - If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and record its predecessor.\n   - Repeat until the target node (2) is dequeued.\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n**Graph Representation:**\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- Edges: [[0, 2], [0, 5], [1, 5], [1, 7], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6]]\n\n**Initialization:**\n- Queue: [6]\n- Visited: {6: None}\n\n**Execution:**\n\n1. **Dequeue Node 6:**\n   - Neighbors: [5]\n   - Mark 5 as visited with predecessor 6.\n   - Queue: [5]\n\n2. **Dequeue Node 5:**\n   - Neighbors: [0, 4, 6]\n   - Skip 6 since it\u2019s already visited.\n   - Mark 0 and 4 as visited with predecessor 5.\n   - Queue: [0, 4]\n\n3. **Dequeue Node 0:**\n   - Neighbors: [2, 5]\n   - Skip 5 since it\u2019s already visited.\n   - Mark 2 as visited with predecessor 0.\n   - Queue: [4, 2]\n\n4. **Dequeue Node 4:**\n   - Neighbors: [3, 5]\n   - Skip 5 since it\u2019s already visited.\n   - Mark 3 as visited with predecessor 4.\n   - Queue: [2, 3]\n\n5. **Dequeue Node 2:**\n   - Target node 2 is reached.\n   - No further processing needed.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- Starting from node 2, follow the predecessors backward:\n  - Node 2 \u2192 Predecessor 0\n  - Node 0 \u2192 Predecessor 6\n\nThus, the path from node 6 to node 2 is:\n6 \u2192 5 \u2192 0 \u2192 2\n\n**Final Answer:**\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->5->0->2"}]
