However, given the small size of this graph, we can also solve this using a breadth-first search (BFS), which is simpler and works well for unweighted graphs.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node before moving on to the next level of nodes.\n3. Keep track of the visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Maintain a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n5.

We don't need to explore node 7 since it doesn't lead directly to node 3.\n- From node 0, we can go to node 3.\n\nSo the path traced back is: 6 -> 1 -> 4 -> 0 -> 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->1->4->0->3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 6], [1, 4], [2, 4], [4, 5], [4, 7]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the start node to the end node in an unweighted graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
