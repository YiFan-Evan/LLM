Given that all the edges in this graph have equal weight (no weights are specified), BFS is sufficient for finding the shortest path.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a queue and adding the start node to it. Also, initialize a dictionary to keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n2. **Breadth-First Traversal**: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node. For each neighbor of the dequeued node that hasn't been visited yet, enqueue the neighbor and record the path taken to reach that neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: The traversal ends when the destination node is dequeued.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Initialize:\n   - Queue: [6]\n   - Path dictionary: {6: [6]}\n\n2. Dequeue 6:\n   - Neighbors of 6: [7, 12]\n   - Add neighbors to the queue and update paths:\n     - Queue: [7, 12]\n     - Path dictionary: {6: [6], 7: [6, 7], 12: [6, 12]}\n\n3. Dequeue 7:\n   - Neighbors of 7: [0, 14]\n   - None of these neighbors are the destination, so continue:\n     - Queue: [12]\n     - Path dictionary: {6: [6], 7: [6, 7], 12: [6, 12]}\n\n4. Dequeue 12:\n   - Neighbors of 12: [6, 8, 13]\n   - None of these neighbors are the destination, so continue:\n     - Queue: [8, 13]\n     - Path dictionary: {6: [6], 7: [6, 7], 12: [6, 12], 8: [6, 12, 8], 13: [6, 12, 13]}\n\n5. Dequeue 8:\n   - Neighbors of 8: [13]\n   - Already visited, so continue:\n     - Queue: [13]\n     - Path dictionary: {6: [6], 7: [6, 7], 12: [6, 12], 8: [6, 12, 8], 13: [6, 12, 13]}\n\n6. Dequeue 13:\n   - Neighbors of 13: [8, 9]\n   - None of these neighbors are the destination, so continue:\n     - Queue: [9]\n     - Path dictionary: {6: [6], 7: [6, 7], 12: [6, 12], 8: [6, 12, 8], 13: [6, 12, 13], 9: [6, 12, 13, 9]}\n\n7. Dequeue 9:\n   - Neighbors of 9: [13]\n   - Already visited, so continue:\n     - Queue: []\n     - Path dictionary: {6: [6], 7: [6, 7], 12: [6, 12], 8: [6, 12, 8], 13: [6, 12, 13], 9: [6, 12, 13, 9]}\n\n8. Dequeue 10:\n   - Neighbors of 10: [12]\n   - Already visited, so continue:\n     - Queue: []\n\nSince the queue is now empty and we haven't found the destination node (5), we need to revisit the steps and ensure we didn't miss any paths. However, it seems we missed checking the neighbors of 12 again properly.\n\nLet's check the neighbors of 12 again:\n- Neighbors of 12: [6, 8, 10]\n- Neighbor 10 was not checked before:\n  - Queue: [10]\n  - Path dictionary: {6: [6], 7: [6, 7], 12: [6, 12], 8: [6, 12, 8], 13: [6, 12, 13], 9: [6, 12, 13, 9], 10: [6, 12, 10]}\n\n9.
