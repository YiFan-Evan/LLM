One common algorithm used for this purpose is Dijkstra's algorithm, which works well for graphs with non-negative edge weights.\n\nHowever, since the graph provided does not have any specified edge weights, we can assume all edges have equal weight (i.e., a unit weight). In this case, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path because BFS explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the destination node, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Then explore all the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on.\n4. Track the path taken to reach each node.\n5. Stop when we reach the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 6.\n2. Explore neighbors of 6: 11 and 14.\n   - Path to 11: 6->11\n   - Path to 14: 6->14\n3. Explore neighbors of 11: 0, 12, and 3.\n   - Path to 0: 6->11->0\n   - Path to 12: 6->11->12\n   - Path to 3: 6->11->3\n4.

BFS is particularly suitable for this task because it explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, ensuring that the first time a vertex is reached, it is via the shortest path from the start node.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the initial node (node 6).\n2. Explore all adjacent nodes.\n3. Add those adjacent nodes to a queue.\n4. Mark the current node as visited to avoid revisiting it.\n5. Dequeue a node and repeat the process until the target node (node 13) is dequeued.\n\nLet's perform BFS step-by-step:\n\n1. Start at node 6.\n2.
