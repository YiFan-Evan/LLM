Since the problem does not specify any weights on the edges, we'll assume all edges have equal weight.\n\nHere, we will use BFS because the graph is unweighted and BFS is simpler and efficient for such cases.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialize**: Start with the source node and mark it as visited.\n2. **Queue**: Use a queue to manage the nodes to be processed.\n3. **Processing**: \n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - Check if it\u2019s the target node.

Start at node 3.\n2. Enqueue 3 and mark it as visited.\n3. Dequeue 3 and enqueue its neighbors (6, 4). Mark them as visited.\n4. Dequeue 6 and enqueue its neighbors (None).\n5.

BFS is particularly suitable for this task because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Create a queue and add the start node (node 3) to it.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node during traversal.\n   - Mark the start node as visited.\n\n2. **Process the Queue**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node that hasn't been visited yet:\n     - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n     - Add the neighbor to the queue.\n     - Record the current node as the parent of the neighbor.\n\n3. **Reconstruct Path**:\n   - Once we reach the target node (node 4), we can trace back from node 4 to node 3 using the parent dictionary.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Queue: [3]\n   - Visited: {3}\n   - Parent: {3: None}\n\n2. **Processing**:\n   - Dequeue node 3.\n   - Neighbors of node 3 are [4, 6]. \n     - Visit node 4.
