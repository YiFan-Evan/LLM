However, since the given graph is unweighted (all edges have equal weight), we can simplify our approach using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can apply BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the node 5. Use a queue to manage the nodes to be explored and a dictionary to track the shortest path to each node.\n2. **Enqueue**: Add the start node (5) to the queue.\n3. **Explore**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target (8). If not, enqueue all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet.\n4. **Track Path**: As we visit each node, record the path taken to reach it.\n5. **Repeat**: Continue until we reach the target node (8).\n\nNow, let's perform the BFS:\n\n- Start at node 5.\n- Explore neighbors: 13 and 18.\n- From 13, explore 19 and 21.\n- From 18, explore 7, 22, 15, and 24.\n- Continue exploring until reaching node 8.\n\nLet's trace the exact path:\n\n1.
