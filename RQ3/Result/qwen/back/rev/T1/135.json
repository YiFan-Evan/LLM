However, since our graph here does not have explicit weights on the edges and all connections are considered equal, we can simplify the process by using a breadth-first search (BFS). BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex, ensuring that when we reach the destination, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of how we can apply BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start at the given start node (node 13).\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes of the current node.\n3. Mark each explored node to avoid revisiting.\n4. Continue exploring until the destination node (node 10) is found.\n5. Trace back the path from the destination node to the start node.\n\nLet's perform the BFS on the provided graph:\n\n- Start at node 13.\n- From node 13, we can move to node 14 (since [13, 14] is an edge).\n- From node 14, we can move to node 7 (since [7, 14] is an edge) or to node 2 (since [2, 14] is an edge).\n- We skip node 7 because it doesn't lead directly to the destination.\n- From node 2, we can move to node 5 (since [2, 5] is an edge).\n- From node 5, we can move to node 10 (since [5, 10] is an edge).\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 13 to node 10 is through nodes 13 -> 14 -> 2 -> 5 -> 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 13->14->2->5->10"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 5], [1, 10], [2, 5], [2, 14], [3, 9], [4, 9], [4, 10], [5, 11], [5, 10], [6, 13], [7, 8], [7, 14], [9, 12], [13, 14]]} The end node: 10 The start node: 13"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 13 to node 10, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is ideal for unweighted graphs like this one.
