Since all the edges in the given graph have the same weight, BFS is a suitable choice for finding the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps we follow using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize the BFS Queue and Visited Set**: Start by adding the starting node to the queue and marking it as visited.\n2. **Process Each Node**: While the queue is not empty, take the first node from the queue. For each neighbor of this node that hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited and add it to the queue. Additionally, store the parent node of each visited node to trace back the path later.\n3. **Check for Destination**: If the current node is the destination node, stop the search and trace back the path using the stored parent nodes.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Start node: 6\n   - Destination node: 4\n   - Queue: [6]\n   - Visited set: {6}\n   - Parent map: {6: None}\n\n2. **Processing Nodes**:\n   - Pop node 6 from the queue.\n   - Neighbors of 6 are [4] (since 6 connects to 4 and 7).\n     - Visit node 4, mark it as visited, and add it to the queue.\n     - Update parent map: {4: 6}\n\n   At this point, node 4 is visited, and since it is the destination, we stop here.\n\n3. **Trace Back the Path**:\n   - Starting from node 4, trace back to its parent node until reaching the start node.\n   - Path: 4 -> 6\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 8], [3, 7], [4, 8], [4, 6], [5, 10], [6, 7], [7, 9], [9, 11], [9, 12], [10, 11]]} The end node: 4 The start node: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem of finding the shortest path from node 6 to node 4 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
