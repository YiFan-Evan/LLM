In this case, the graph does not have weights on its edges, so BFS is particularly appropriate due to its simplicity.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Explore all neighbors of the current node before moving on to the next level of nodes.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n4. Use a queue to manage which nodes to visit next.\n5. Stop once we reach the target node.\n\nNow let's apply this to our specific problem.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Start at node 3**.\n2. **Explore neighbors**: Nodes connected to 3 are 4 and 7.\n3. **Continue exploring** until we find node 0.\n\nLet's follow the steps:\n\n1. **Current Node**: 3\n   - Neighbors: 4, 7\n   - Add these neighbors to the queue: [4, 7]\n\n2. **Current Node**: 4\n   - No new nodes to explore from here.\n   - Continue to next node in the queue: 7\n\n3. **Current Node**: 7\n   - No new nodes to explore from here.\n   - Continue to next node in the queue: 4\n\n4. **Current Node**: 4\n   - No new nodes to explore from here.\n   - Continue to next node in the queue: 7\n\nSince neither 4 nor 7 lead directly to the target, we need to go back and check other paths.\n\n1. **Current Node**: 3\n   - Other neighbors: 0, 10\n   - Add these neighbors to the queue: [10, 0]\n\n2. **Current Node**: 10\n   - Neighbors: 1, 8, 11, 12\n   - Add these neighbors to the queue: [1, 8, 11, 12]\n\n3. **Current Node**: 0\n   - We have reached the target node 0 directly from node 3.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- From node 3 to node 0 directly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **3->0**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 3], [0, 10], [1, 10], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 7], [6, 8], [8, 10], [9, 12], [10, 11], [10, 12]]} The end node: 0 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 3 to node 0 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is ideal for this task because it explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, ensuring that the shortest path is found when the target node is reached.\n\n### Steps of BFS:\n1. Start at the initial node (node 3).\n2. Enqueue the initial node.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - If this node is the target node (node 0), reconstruct the path and stop.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n4.
