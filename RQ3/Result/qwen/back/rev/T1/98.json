Since all the edges in the provided graph do not have weights, BFS is sufficient for finding the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps for using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the given start node.

For each neighbor that hasn\u2019t been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n3. **Repeat**: Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\n- Edges: [[0, 7], [0, 10], [0, 8], [1, 4], [2, 8], [2, 6], [2, 9], [3, 10], [4, 10], [5, 11], [5, 6], [9, 12]]\n\nStarting node: 8\nDestination node: 9\n\n**Step-by-step BFS:**\n\n1.

BFS is well-suited for this task because it explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, ensuring that the shortest path is found when the target node is reached.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create a queue and add the start node (node 8).\n   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path later.\n\n2. **BFS Execution**:\n   - Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node (node 9).\n   - If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and update their parent.\n   - Continue until the target node is dequeued.\n\n### Applying BFS to the Graph:\n\n1. **Start at node 8**:\n   - Queue: [8]\n   - Parent Dictionary: {8: None}\n\n2. **Dequeue node 8**:\n   - Neighbors: [2, 6, 9]\n   - Enqueue: [2, 6, 9]\n   - Update Parents: {8: None, 2: 8, 6: 8, 9: 8}\n\n3. **Dequeue node 2**:\n   - Neighbors: [8, 6, 9]\n   - All neighbors already visited or queued, so skip.\n\n4. **Dequeue node 6**:\n   - Neighbors: [2, 5]\n   - Enqueue: []\n   - No new updates needed.\n\n5. **Dequeue node 9**:\n   - Target node found.\n\n### Reconstructing the Path:\n\n- Start at node 9.\n- Follow the parent pointers backward:\n  - Node 9's parent is 8.\n  - Node 8's parent is None (start node).\n\nThus, the path from 8 to 9 is: 8 -> 9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->9."}]
