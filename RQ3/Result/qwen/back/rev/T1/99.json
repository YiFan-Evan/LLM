However, for simplicity and given the relatively small size of the graph, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS), which is efficient for unweighted graphs like the one provided.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start with the starting node (node 4). Mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: For each node in the queue, explore its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited, record the path, and add it to the queue.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the target node (node 11) is reached.\n4. **Path Construction**: Track the path by recording the parent of each node visited.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 11.\n\n### BFS Steps\n\n- Start at node 4.\n- Explore neighbors: Node 4 is connected to node 8.\n  - Add node 8 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n- Next, explore node 8:\n  - Node 8 is connected to node 9.\n    - Add node 9 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n- Next, explore node 9:\n  - Node 9 is connected to node 11.\n    - Add node 11 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n    - Since node 11 is the target node, stop here.\n\n### Path Reconstruction\n- From node 11, trace back to node 9.\n- From node 9, trace back to node 8.\n- From node 8, trace back to node 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->8->9->11"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 11], [1, 7], [1, 4], [1, 12], [2, 5], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 8], [6, 10], [8, 9], [9, 11], [10, 11]]} The end node: 11 The start node: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 4 to node 11 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
