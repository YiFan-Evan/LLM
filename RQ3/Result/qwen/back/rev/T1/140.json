However, since the graph described here is unweighted (all edges have equal weight), we can simplify the approach by using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the current depth level before moving to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Keep track of the visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n4. Use a queue to manage the nodes to be explored next.\n5. Record the path taken to reach each node.\n6.

Node 6 doesn't lead to node 1 directly, so move to the next neighbor of node 14 (node 5).\n6. Node 5 does not lead to node 1 directly, so continue exploring.\n7.
