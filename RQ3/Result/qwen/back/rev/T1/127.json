However, since the given graph does not have weights on its edges, and it appears to be unweighted, we can also use a simpler breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.\n\n### Explanation of BFS:\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This algorithm explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, meaning it visits all the neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It guarantees to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it expands the frontier level by level.\n  \n- **Steps**:\n  1. Start from the source node.\n  2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the current depth level.\n  3. Move to the next depth level and repeat until the target node is found or all reachable nodes are visited.\n\n### Applying BFS to the Problem:\n1. Start from node `10`.\n2. Visit its neighbors: `8` and `11`.\n3. From `8`, visit `10` (already visited) and `12` and `14` (not relevant).\n4. From `11`, visit `10` (already visited) and `14` (not relevant).\n5. From `8`, visit `10` (already visited) and `12` and `14` (not relevant).\n6. From `12`, visit `4` and `8` (already visited).\n7. From `14`, visit `3` and `10` (already visited).\n8.

From `13`, visit `0` (already visited) and `5` (not relevant).\n12. From `5`, visit `6` and `13` (already visited).\n\nSince we have reached node `6` from node `5`, the shortest path from `10` to `6` is through `8`, `10`, `11`, `14`, `3`, `0`, `5`, and finally `6`.\n\n### Shortest Path:\nThe shortest path from node `10` to node `6` is: \n10 -> 11 -> 14 -> 3 -> 0 -> 5 -> 6\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->11->14->3->0->5->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 13], [0, 3], [1, 9], [1, 6], [2, 8], [3, 14], [4, 12], [4, 8], [5, 6], [5, 13], [7, 9], [8, 10], [10, 11], [10, 14]]} The end node: 6 The start node: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
