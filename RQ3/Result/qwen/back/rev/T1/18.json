Since the problem does not mention edge weights, BFS is an appropriate choice due to its simplicity and efficiency for unweighted graphs.\n\nHere are the steps we follow using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by adding the start node to a queue and marking it as visited.\n2. **Processing the Queue**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found our path. Otherwise, add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue and mark them as visited.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue processing nodes until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Track the path from the start node to the target node by keeping a record of the parent nodes for each node during BFS.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the provided graph:\n\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- Edges: [[0, 1], [0, 3], [0, 7], [2, 5], [3, 5], [4, 7], [5, 6]]\n- Start Node: 6\n- Destination Node: 2\n\n### Step-by-step BFS Execution:\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Start at node 6.\n   - Mark 6 as visited.\n   - Add 6 to the queue.\n\n2. **Process Queue**:\n   - Dequeue 6.\n   - Neighbors of 6 are [5].\n   - Add 5 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\n3. **Process Queue**:\n   - Dequeue 5.\n   - Neighbors of 5 are [2] and [6] (but 6 is already visited).\n   - Add 2 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\n4. **Process Queue**:\n   - Dequeue 2.\n   - 2 is the target node, so we stop here.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- From the above steps, we know:\n  - 6 -> 5 -> 2\n- Therefore, the shortest path from 6 to 2 is: 6->5->2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->5->2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 3], [0, 7], [2, 5], [3, 5], [4, 7], [5, 6]]} The end node: 2 The start node: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the start node to the end node in an unweighted graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
