Since the problem does not specify any weights on the edges, we can assume all edges have equal weight, and thus BFS is a suitable method.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the source node and mark it as visited.\n2. **Queue**: Use a queue to manage nodes to be processed next.\n3. **Processing**: For each node, explore its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n4. **Tracking Path**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n5. **Termination**: Stop when the target node is reached.\n\n### Applying BFS to the Problem:\n- Start Node: 5\n- Target Node: 4\n\n#### BFS Execution:\n1.
