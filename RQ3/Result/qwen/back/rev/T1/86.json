Now, explore neighbors of node 0: We can go to node 5 (since [0, 5] is an edge).\n4. Next, explore neighbors of node 5: We can go to node 8 (since [5, 8] is an edge).\n5.

While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - If this node is the target node (11), reconstruct the path using the parent information.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its neighbors that have not been visited yet.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize queue: [7]\n2. Mark 7 as visited and set its parent as None.\n3. Dequeue 7, check its neighbors: [0, 5].\n4. Enqueue 0 and 5.\n5. Dequeue 0, check its neighbors: [7, 5].
