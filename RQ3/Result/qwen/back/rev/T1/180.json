Start at the given start node (node 7).\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited yet, record the path taken to reach it and mark it as visited.\n4.

BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest path from the starting node.\n\nHere's how BFS works step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Create a queue and add the start node (node 7) to it.\n   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each node to reconstruct the path later.\n\n2. **Explore Nodes**:\n   - Dequeue a node and check if it is the destination node.\n   - If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and set the current node as the parent of these neighbors.\n\n3. **Track Path**:\n   - Once the destination node is dequeued, trace back from the destination node to the start node using the parent dictionary to get the shortest path.\n\nLet's go through the BFS algorithm for this specific graph:\n\n- **Start at node 7**.\n- **Neighbors of node 7**: [10, 13].\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution\n\n1. **Enqueue node 7**.\n2. **Dequeue node 7**:\n   - Neighbors: [10, 13].\n   - Enqueue node 10 and node 13.\n   - Set parents: {10: 7, 13: 7}.\n\n3. **Dequeue node 10**:\n   - Neighbors: [0, 3, 7].\n   - Node 10 is not the destination.\n   - No new nodes to enqueue (already visited).\n\n4. **Dequeue node 13**:\n   - Neighbors: [7, 12].\n   - Node 13 is not the destination.\n   - Enqueue node 12.\n   - Set parents: {12: 13}.\n\n5. **Dequeue node 12**:\n   - Neighbors: [1, 13].\n   - Node 12 is not the destination.\n   - No new nodes to enqueue (already visited).\n\n6. **Dequeue node 1**:\n   - Neighbors: [9, 6, 12].\n   - Node 1 is not the destination.\n   - Enqueue node 9 and node 6.\n   - Set parents: {9: 1, 6: 1}.\n\n7. **Dequeue node 9**:\n   - Neighbors: [1, 23].\n   - Node 9 is not the destination.\n   - No new nodes to enqueue (already visited).\n\n8. **Dequeue node 6**:\n   - Neighbors: [1, 8, 16].\n   - Node 6 is not the destination.\n   - Enqueue node 8 and node 16.\n   - Set parents: {8: 6, 16: 6}.\n\n9. **Dequeue node 8**:\n   - Neighbors: [6, 21].\n   - Node 8 is not the destination.\n   - Enqueue node 21.\n   - Set parents: {21: 8}.\n\n10. **Dequeue node 16**:\n    - Neighbors: [2, 5, 19].\n    - Node 16 is not the destination.\n    - Enqueue node 2, node 5, and node 19.\n    - Set parents: {2: 16, 5: 16, 19: 16}.\n\n11. **Dequeue node 2**:\n    - Neighbors: [16].\n    - Node 2 is not the destination.\n    - No new nodes to enqueue (already visited).\n\n12. **Dequeue node 5**:\n    - Node 5 is the destination.\n    - We stop here and trace back the path.\n\n### Reconstructing the Path\n\n- Starting from node 5:\n  - Parent of 5 is 16.\n  - Parent of 16 is 6.\n  - Parent of 6 is 1.\n  - Parent of 1 is 7.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 7 to node 5 is: 7->1->6->16->5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->1->6->16->5."}]
