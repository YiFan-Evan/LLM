However, for simplicity and since the graph is relatively small, we can also solve this by inspection or using a breadth-first search (BFS). BFS is particularly suitable because all edges have the same weight.\n\nHere are the steps to perform BFS:\n\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Continue until you reach the target node.\n4.

BFS is effective for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs because it explores nodes layer by layer, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's outline the BFS process:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (7) to it.\n2. Mark node 7 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - Check if it is the target node (8).\n   - If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n   - Mark them as visited.\n4. Continue until the target node is dequeued or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's follow the BFS process step-by-step:\n\n1. Start at node 7.\n2. Enqueue its neighbors: 9 and 11.\n3. Dequeue node 9 and enqueue its neighbors: 3, 7, and 10.\n4. Dequeue node 10 and enqueue its neighbor: 6.\n5. Dequeue node 6 and enqueue its neighbor: 4.\n6. Dequeue node 4 and enqueue its neighbors: 6 and 13.\n7. Dequeue node 13 and enqueue its neighbors: 0, 1, 4, and 8.\n8. Dequeue node 8 which is our target node.\n\nNow tracing back the path:\n- Node 8 is connected directly to node 13.\n- Node 13 is connected to node 4.\n- Node 4 is connected to node 6.\n- Node 6 is connected to node 10.\n- Node 10 is connected to node 9.\n- Node 9 is connected to node 7.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->9->10->6->4->13->8"}]
