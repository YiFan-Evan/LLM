Since all the edges in the provided graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start by initializing a queue and adding the starting node to it.\n2. Mark the starting node as visited and set its distance to 0.\n3. Process nodes in the queue one by one:\n   - For each node, explore all its adjacent nodes.\n   - If an adjacent node has not been visited yet, mark it as visited, set its distance to the current node\u2019s distance plus one, and add it to the queue.\n4.
