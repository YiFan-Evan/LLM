Both algorithms aim to find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges from the start node to the target node.\n\nHere, BFS is a straightforward choice because the graph is unweighted, and BFS guarantees to find the shortest path in such scenarios.\n\n**Steps for BFS:**\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (17) to it.\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the distance (number of edges) from the start node to each node and the previous node in the path.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited yet:\n       - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n       - Update the distance and the previous node.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n4. Once the target node (16) is dequeued, reconstruct the path using the previous node information.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. Initialize the queue: Queue = [17]\n2.

Skip 23 as already visited.\n   - Enqueue 15, update distances and previous nodes:\n     - {15: (3, 14)}\n   - Dequeue 21, neighbors are [20, 23, 21]. Skip 23 and 21 as already visited.\n   - Enqueue 20, update distances and previous nodes:\n     - {20: (3, 21)}\n   - Dequeue 15, neighbors are [14, 23]. Skip 14 and 23 as already visited.\n   - Dequeue 20, neighbors are [21, 23]. Skip 21 and 23 as already visited.\n   - Dequeue 23, neighbors are [14, 21, 23]. Skip 14, 21, and 23 as already visited.\n   - Dequeue 16, neighbors are [0, 16].
