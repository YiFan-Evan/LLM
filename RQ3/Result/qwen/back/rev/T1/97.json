However, given the small size of the graph provided, we can also solve this by examining all possible paths manually or using a breadth-first search (BFS), which is simpler for unweighted graphs.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. Start from the source node (node 2).\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. From each neighbor, explore their neighbors, keeping track of the path taken.\n4. Stop when the destination node (node 9) is found.\n\nLet's trace through the graph step-by-step:\n\n- Node 2 connects to node 12.\n- Node 12 connects to nodes 0, 5, and 7.\n- None of these nodes lead directly to node 9.\n\nNow, let's see if there's any other path:\n- Node 2 does not have any direct connection to node 9, so we need to check if there's any indirect path.\n\nChecking other paths:\n- Node 2 -> Node 12 -> Node 0 -> ... (No direct path to 9)\n- Node 2 -> Node 12 -> Node 5 -> ... (No direct path to 9)\n- Node 2 -> Node 12 -> Node 7 -> ...

BFS is particularly suitable for this task because it explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the destination node, we've done so via the shortest path.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start from node 2 and mark it as visited. Use a queue to manage nodes to be explored.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Add all unvisited neighbors of the current node to the queue.\n3. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Check Destination**: If the destination node (node 9) is reached, stop and reconstruct the path.\n\nLet's go through the BFS process:\n\n1. **Start at node 2**:\n   - Current node: 2\n   - Visited: {2}\n   - Queue: [2]\n\n2. **Explore node 2**:\n   - Neighbors of 2: [12]\n   - Mark 12 as visited and add to the queue.\n   - Visited: {2, 12}\n   - Queue: [12]\n\n3. **Explore node 12**:\n   - Neighbors of 12: [0, 5, 7]\n   - Mark 0, 5, and 7 as visited and add them to the queue.\n   - Visited: {2, 12, 0, 5, 7}\n   - Queue: [0, 5, 7]\n\n4. **Explore node 0**:\n   - Neighbors of 0: [9]\n   - Mark 9 as visited and add to the queue.\n   - Visited: {2, 12, 0, 5, 7, 9}\n   - Queue: [5, 7, 9]\n\n5. **Destination Found**:\n   - Node 9 is in the queue, so the shortest path is found.\n\nNow, let's reconstruct the path:\n- Node 9 was reached from node 0.\n- Node 0 was reached from node 12.\n- Node 12 was reached from node 2.\n\nTherefore, the final path is: 2 -> 12 -> 0 -> 9\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->12->0->9"}]
