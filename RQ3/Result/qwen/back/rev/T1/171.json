For simplicity and since all edges in this graph are unweighted, we can use BFS, which explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is visited, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start at the given start node (10). Mark this node as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Explore**: Dequeue a node and explore its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the destination node (9) is dequeued.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 10 to node 9:\n\n- Start at node 10.\n- Node 10 is connected to node 9.

Create a queue and add node 10 to it. Also, maintain a dictionary to keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n2. **Explore**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the destination (node 9). If yes, reconstruct the path. If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and update the path dictionary.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue the process until node 9 is dequeued.\n\n### Execution:\n\n- **Start at node 10**:\n  - Queue: [10]\n  - Path dictionary: {10: []}\n\n- **Dequeue node 10**:\n  - Neighbors of 10: [9]\n  - Enqueue node 9 and update path dictionary: {10: [], 9: [10]}\n\n- **Dequeue node 9**:\n  - Node 9 is the destination, so stop here.\n\n### Reconstruct the Path:\n- From the path dictionary, we know:\n  - Node 9 was reached from node 10.\n  \nSo the path is: 10 -> 9\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->9"}]
