However, since the graph is relatively small, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach because all edge weights are equal.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the given node (node 9).\n2. Explore its neighbors.\n3. Then explore the neighbors of those neighbors.\n4. Continue until you reach the target node (node 2).\n\nLet's apply BFS step by step:\n\n1. Start at node 9.\n2. From node 9, explore its neighbors: node 10 (since the edge [5, 9] and [9, 10] connect these nodes).\n3. From node 10, explore its neighbors: node 8 and node 3 (since the edges [0, 8] and [3, 10] connect these nodes).\n4. From node 8, explore its neighbors: node 0 and node 10 (already visited).\n5. From node 10, explore its neighbors: node 8 (already visited) and node 3 (already visited).\n6. From node 3, explore its neighbors: node 10 (already visited) and node 10 (already visited).\n7. Since none of the immediate neighbors lead directly to node 2, we need to explore further.\n8. From node 10, explore its neighbors again but this time look for new nodes: node 0 and node 8 (already visited).\n9. From node 0, explore its neighbors: node 1 and node 8 (already visited).\n10. From node 8, explore its neighbors: node 0 (already visited) and node 10 (already visited).\n11. From node 10, explore its neighbors: node 0 (already visited) and node 3 (already visited).\n12. From node 3, explore its neighbors: node 10 (already visited) and node 10 (already visited).\n13. Now, go back to node 10 and check if there are any other unvisited neighbors.\n14. From node 10, explore its neighbors again: node 8 (already visited) and node 3 (already visited).\n15. Finally, from node 3, explore its neighbors again but this time look for new nodes: node 10 (already visited) and node 10 (already visited).\n16.
