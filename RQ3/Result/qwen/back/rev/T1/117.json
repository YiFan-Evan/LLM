However, since the given graph does not have weights specified for its edges, we can assume all edges have equal weight (i.e., they are unweighted). In such a case, Dijkstra's algorithm simplifies to a breadth-first search (BFS), which explores all neighboring nodes before moving to the next level of nodes.\n\nHere's how we can apply BFS to find the shortest path from the start node to the destination:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start at node 4 and create a queue to hold nodes to visit. Also, keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Visit each neighbor of the current node, adding them to the queue if they haven't been visited yet. Update the path to each neighbor.\n3. **Check Destination**: If the destination node (node 8) is encountered, stop the search and reconstruct the path.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n- **Step 1**: Start at node 4. The neighbors of node 4 are nodes 0 and 1. We add these to our queue.\n- **Step 2**: From node 1, we explore its neighbors: nodes 4, 9, and 8. Node 8 is our destination, so we stop here.\n\nNow, let's trace back the path from node 8 to node 4:\n- Node 8 is reached from node 1.\n- Node 1 is reached from node 4.\n\nThus, the path is: 4->1->8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->1->8."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 4], [1, 9], [1, 8], [2, 10], [2, 7], [3, 6], [3, 10], [5, 11], [7, 12], [8, 11], [8, 12]]} The end node: 8 The start node: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
