In this case, since all edges can be assumed to have equal weight (no weights are provided), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This makes BFS ideal for finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nLet's break down the steps we'll take:\n1. Start from the given node (5).\n2. Explore its neighbors.\n3. For each neighbor, explore their neighbors, and so on, marking nodes as visited to avoid cycles.\n4.

BFS is appropriate here because it explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the BFS process:\n\n1. **Initialize BFS**: Start from node 5. Use a queue to manage the nodes to visit and a set to track visited nodes.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Add all neighbors of the current node to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\n3. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node to reconstruct the shortest path once we reach the target node.\n\nLet's perform the BFS:\n\n1. **Start at node 5**.\n   - Visited nodes: {5}\n   - Queue: [5]\n\n2. **Visit node 5**:\n   - Neighbors of 5 are 11 and 4.\n   - Add these neighbors to the queue.\n   - Visited nodes: {5, 11, 4}\n   - Queue: [11, 4]\n\n3. **Visit node 11**:\n   - Neighbors of 11 are 1, 5, and 7.\n   - Nodes 5 and 11 are already visited.\n   - Add node 7 to the queue.\n   - Visited nodes: {5, 11, 4, 7}\n   - Queue: [4, 7]\n\n4. **Visit node 7**:\n   - No new neighbors.\n   - Visited nodes: {5, 11, 4, 7}\n   - Queue: [4]\n\n5. **Visit node 4**:\n   - Neighbors of 4 are 3, 5, and 8.\n   - Nodes 5 and 4 are already visited.\n   - Add node 3 to the queue.\n   - Visited nodes: {5, 11, 4, 7, 3}\n   - Queue: [3]\n\n6. **Visit node 3**:\n   - Target node reached.\n   - Visited nodes: {5, 11, 4, 7, 3}\n\nNow, we need to reconstruct the path from 5 to 3. Starting from 3, trace back through the parents recorded during BFS:\n\n- 3 was reached from 4.\n- 4 was reached from 5.\n\nTherefore, the path is 5->4->3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->4->3."}]
