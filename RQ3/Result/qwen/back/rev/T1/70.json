In this case, since the graph's edges do not have explicit weights, we'll assume they are all of equal weight. Therefore, BFS is a suitable method for finding the shortest path.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start by marking the start node as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Processing**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the destination. If yes, stop. If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the queue is empty or the destination is found.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the destination is reached, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the destination to the start using the parent pointers.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n- **Start Node**: 4\n- **Destination Node**: 2\n\n#### BFS Execution:\n- Enqueue node 4.\n- Dequeue node 4, check its neighbors: [0, 7].

Enqueue node 2 (nodes 1 and 6 don't lead directly to the destination).\n- Dequeue node 2. Since this is our destination, stop.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- The path from 4 to 2 can be reconstructed by backtracking through the nodes visited during BFS.
