This algorithm is particularly useful for graphs with non-negative weights on the edges.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n1. **Initialization**: Assign a tentative distance value to every node. Set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. Mark all nodes as unvisited.\n2. **Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance**, and consider it the current node.\n3. For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n4. When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you mark the destination node as visited or until the smallest tentative distance among the unvisited nodes is infinity (which happens when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes).\n6. Once the destination node has been marked visited (or if the smallest tentative distance given from the node is infinity), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n\n### Applying Dijkstra's Algorithm:\nLet's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the provided graph with the starting node 12 and the destination node 6.\n\n1.
