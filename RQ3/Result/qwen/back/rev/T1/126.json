This algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to be visited, starting with the initial node. It then iteratively selects the node with the smallest known distance from the start node, examines each of its neighbors, and updates their distances if a shorter path is found through the current node.\n\nHowever, for simplicity and because our graph is relatively small, we can also perform a breadth-first search (BFS) since all the edges have equal weight (therefore, no need to prioritize based on distance).\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow using BFS:\n\n1. Start at node 9.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes level by level.\n3. Track the path taken to reach each node.\n4. Stop when we reach node 10.\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the shortest path from node 9 to node 10:\n\n- Starting from node 9, we see that it connects directly to nodes 13 and 14.\n- From node 13, we can go to node 5 or 9 (but we already came from there).\n- From node 5, we can go to node 8 or 13 (but we already came from there).\n- From node 8, we don't have any new connections that help us get closer to node 10.\n- From node 14, we don't have any new connections that help us get closer to node 10.\n- From node 9, we also connect to node 13, which connects to node 9 again, so we skip revisiting.\n- Let's now look at other direct connections from node 9:\n  - Node 9 connects to node 13, which connects to node 10 (directly or indirectly).\n\nBy exploring further, we find:\n- Node 9 -> Node 13 -> Node 10\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->13->10"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 6], [1, 2], [1, 4], [3, 10], [4, 10], [5, 8], [5, 13], [6, 8], [7, 11], [9, 13], [9, 14], [10, 11], [11, 12]]} The end node: 10 The start node: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 9 to node 10, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Mark node 9 as visited and add it to the queue.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Dequeue node 9 and explore its neighbors (nodes connected directly to node 9).
