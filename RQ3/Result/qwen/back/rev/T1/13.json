However, given the small size of the graph, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is simpler and works well for unweighted graphs like this one.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the source node (node 3) and explore all its neighbors.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: For each neighbor, check if it has been visited. If not, add it to a queue or list to be explored next.\n3. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Reach Destination**: Stop when you reach the destination node (node 5).\n\nLet's apply these steps to the provided graph:\n\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- Edges: [[0, 1], [0, 6], [0, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 4], [5, 7]]\n\nStarting at node 3:\n- From node 3, we can go to nodes 0 and 4.\n- From node 0, we can go to nodes 1 and 6.\n- From node 4, we can go to node 2.\n- From node 2, we can go to nodes 4 and 5.\n\nNow, let's trace the path step-by-step:\n\n1.

BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path from the start node.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the source node (node 3). Use a queue to manage the nodes to be processed.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: For each node, explore all its neighbors. Mark the node as visited and enqueue its neighbors.\n3. **Track Path**: Maintain a dictionary to keep track of the parent node of each node to reconstruct the path later.\n4. **Stop Condition**: When the destination node (node 5) is reached, stop and backtrack using the parent information to get the shortest path.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Start node: 3\n   - Queue: [3]\n   - Visited: {3}\n   - Parent: {3: None}\n\n2. **Process Node 3**:\n   - Neighbors: [0, 4]\n   - Enqueue: [0, 4]\n   - Visited: {3, 0, 4}\n   - Parent: {3: None, 0: 3, 4: 3}\n\n3. **Process Node 0**:\n   - Neighbors: [1, 6]\n   - Enqueue: [4, 1, 6]\n   - Visited: {3, 0, 4, 1, 6}\n   - Parent: {3: None, 0: 3, 4: 3, 1: 0, 6: 0}\n\n4. **Process Node 4**:\n   - Neighbors: [2]\n   - Enqueue: [1, 6, 2]\n   - Visited: {3, 0, 4, 1, 6, 2}\n   - Parent: {3: None, 0: 3, 4: 3, 1: 0, 6: 0, 2: 4}\n\n5. **Process Node 1**:\n   - Neighbors: []\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Visited: {3, 0, 4, 1, 6, 2}\n   - Parent: {3: None, 0: 3, 4: 3, 1: 0, 6: 0, 2: 4}\n\n6. **Process Node 6**:\n   - Neighbors: []\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Visited: {3, 0, 4, 1, 6, 2}\n   - Parent: {3: None, 0: 3, 4: 3, 1: 0, 6: 0, 2: 4}\n\n7. **Process Node 2**:\n   - Neighbors: [5]\n   - Enqueue: [5]\n   - Visited: {3, 0, 4, 1, 6, 2, 5}\n   - Parent: {3: None, 0: 3, 4: 3, 1: 0, 6: 0, 2: 4, 5: 2}\n\n8. **Process Node 5**:\n   - Destination reached\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Visited: {3, 0, 4, 1, 6, 2, 5}\n   - Parent: {3: None, 0: 3, 4: 3, 1: 0, 6: 0, 2: 4, 5: 2}\n\n### Reconstructing the Path:\n- Starting from node 5, trace back using the parent information:\n  - Node 5 -> Node 2 (parent of 5)\n  - Node 2 -> Node 4 (parent of 2)\n  - Node 4 -> Node 3 (parent of 4)\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 3 to node 5 is: 3 -> 4 -> 2 -> 5\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->4->2->5"}]
