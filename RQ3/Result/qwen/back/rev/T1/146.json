BFS is particularly useful for this task because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest path.\n\nHere's how BFS works step-by-step:\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the current depth level.\n3. Move to the next depth level by exploring all unvisited neighbors of the nodes at the current depth level.\n4.
