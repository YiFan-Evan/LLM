One such algorithm is Dijkstra's Algorithm, which efficiently computes the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.\n\nHowever, given the simplicity of the graph provided, we can also solve this problem using a breadth-first search (BFS), which is particularly well-suited for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, where the shortest path is defined by the fewest number of edges traversed.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes of the current node before moving to the next level of nodes.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4.
