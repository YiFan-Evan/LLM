BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, meaning it visits all the neighbors of a vertex before moving on to their neighbors. This ensures that the first time we reach a destination node, it is via the shortest possible path.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start by adding the initial node to a queue.\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node and check if it is the destination node.\n   - If it is the destination node, the search ends.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.\n4. Repeat until the destination node is found or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 2.\n2. Enqueue node 2 and mark it as visited.\n3. Dequeue node 2 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 6 and 4.\n4. Dequeue node 6 and mark it as visited. Its neighbors are already visited.\n5. Dequeue node 4 and mark it as visited. Enqueue its unvisited neighbor: 7.\n6. Node 7 has no new unvisited neighbors.\n7. Dequeue node 6 again (from step 3) and enqueue its other neighbor: 3.\n8. Dequeue node 3 and mark it as visited. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 5 and 6.\n9. Dequeue node 5 and mark it as visited.
