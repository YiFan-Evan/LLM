In this case, since all the edges are unweighted (meaning they all have the same cost), BFS is a suitable and straightforward choice.\n\nBreadth-First Search works by exploring all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, meaning it visits all the neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a destination node is found, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the current depth level.\n3. Move to the next depth level and repeat step 2 until the destination node is found.\n4. Trace back the path from the destination node to the start node using the parent pointers recorded during the search.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- Edges: [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [3, 7], [4, 6], [6, 7]]\n- Start Node: 0\n- Destination Node: 6\n\n### Execution of BFS:\n1. Initialize the queue with the start node (0) and mark it as visited.\n2. Dequeue node 0 and enqueue its neighbors (1, 3).\n3. Dequeue node 1 and mark it as visited.\n4.

Dequeue node 6 and mark it as visited (found the destination).\n\nWe trace back the path from node 6 to node 0 using the parent pointers.\n\n### Path Tracing:\n- Node 6 has node 7 as its parent.\n- Node 7 has node 3 as its parent.\n- Node 3 has node 0 as its parent.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is 0->3->6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->3->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [3, 7], [4, 6], [6, 7]]} The end node: 6 The start node: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the start node to the end node in a graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
