Set all other nodes' distances to infinity.\n\n2. **Processing Nodes**: For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. When all neighbors have been considered, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\n\n3. **Select Next Node**: Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node\", and go back to step 2.\n\n4. **Termination**: Continue this process until the destination node (node 19) is marked as visited or there are no nodes left to visit.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n- Start at node 23.\n- From node 23, we can move directly to nodes 11, 10, 14, and 19.
