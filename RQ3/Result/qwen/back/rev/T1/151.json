Since all the edges in the given graph are unweighted, BFS is sufficient for finding the shortest path.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. For each neighbor, record the distance from the source node and the previous node in the path.\n4. Continue exploring the next level of nodes until the destination node is reached.\n5. Trace back the path from the destination node to the source node using the recorded information.\n\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Initialize the BFS queue with the start node (0).\n2.
