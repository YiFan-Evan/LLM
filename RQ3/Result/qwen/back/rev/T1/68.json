In this case, since the edges do not have weights, we will assume they are all equal and use BFS.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how BFS works:\n1. Start by adding the initial node to a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. Dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\n3. If a neighbor has not been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited while recording the path taken to reach it.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the destination node is dequeued.\n5. Once the destination node is reached, reconstruct the path from the source to the destination using the recorded paths.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Initialize the queue with node 0 and mark it as visited.\n2. Dequeue node 0, enqueue its neighbors 7 (not yet visited).\n3. Dequeue node 7, enqueue its neighbors (none, as it\u2019s a leaf node).\n4. Dequeue node 1 (neighbor of 0), enqueue its neighbors 2, 3, and 6.\n5. Dequeue node 2, enqueue its neighbor 4.\n6. Dequeue node 3, which is our destination. Mark it as visited and stop the search.\n\nNow, we need to trace back the path from node 3 to node 0. The path is recorded as follows:\n- Node 3 was reached directly from node 1.\n- Node 1 was reached directly from node 0.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is: 0->1->3\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->1->3"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 6], [2, 4], [3, 5], [6, 7]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two points in a graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
