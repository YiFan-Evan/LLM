However, since the given graph does not have weights on its edges and all edges are assumed to have equal weight (or no weight at all), we can simplify our approach by using a breadth-first search (BFS). BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex, making it ideal for unweighted graphs.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can apply BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the source node (node 5). Mark this node as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Dequeue a node and check its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited:\n   - Mark it as visited.\n   - Record the path taken to reach this neighbor.\n   - Enqueue the neighbor.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue until the target node (node 6) is dequeued or the queue is empty.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target node is reached, trace back the recorded paths to construct the shortest path from the start node to the target node.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the provided graph:\n\n- Start at node 5.\n- Node 5 connects to node 7.\n- From node 7, there are no direct connections to node 6.\n- So, backtrack and explore other options. Node 5 also connects indirectly through other nodes like node 1 and node 2, but the shortest path directly involves node 7.\n\nGiven the structure of the graph, let's explore the possible paths:\n\n- From node 5, the direct connection is to node 7.\n- Node 7 connects to node 1.\n- Node 1 connects to node 0.\n- Node 0 connects to node 4.\n- Node 4 connects to node 3.\n- Node 0 also connects to node 6 directly.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 5 to node 6 involves going through node 7 and then node 1, and finally reaching node 6 directly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->7->1->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 6], [0, 1], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [5, 7]]} The end node: 6 The start node: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps to apply BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the source node (node 5).
