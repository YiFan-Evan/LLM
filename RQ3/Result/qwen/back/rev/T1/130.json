However, given the simplicity of the graph provided, we can also solve this problem by using a breadth-first search (BFS) which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start from the source node and mark it as visited. Use a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next.\n2. **Traversal**: Dequeue a node, check all its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n3. **Termination**: When the target node is dequeued, the traversal ends. The recorded path to this node is the shortest path.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n- Start at node 6.\n- Explore all its neighbors (in this case, nodes 12 and 13).\n- Continue exploring from these neighbors until reaching node 10.\n\nLet's trace through the BFS step-by-step:\n\n1. Enqueue node 6.\n2. Dequeue node 6 and explore its neighbors: \n   - Node 12: Enqueue node 12.\n   - Node 13: Enqueue node 13.\n3.

Dequeue node 13 and explore its neighbors:\n   - Node 10: Enqueue node 10 and record the path.\n\nSince we've reached the target node 10, we backtrack to get the shortest path.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- From node 10, we came from node 13.\n- From node 13, we came from node 6.\n\nThus, the shortest path is 6 -> 13 -> 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->13->10"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 11], [2, 11], [2, 6], [2, 13], [3, 7], [4, 8], [5, 10], [5, 8], [6, 12], [7, 8], [7, 14], [8, 9], [10, 13]]} The end node: 10 The start node: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
