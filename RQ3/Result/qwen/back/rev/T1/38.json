Here, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nLet's outline the steps for BFS:\n1. Start from the source node.\n2. Explore all its neighboring nodes.\n3. For each neighbor, record the distance from the source node and mark it as visited.\n4. Continue until the target node is found or all reachable nodes are explored.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to our specific problem:\n\n- **Nodes**: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- **Edges**: [[0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n- **Start Node**: 1\n- **Destination Node**: 2\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize the queue with the start node (1).\n2. Explore the neighbors of node 1: Nodes 3 and 7.\n3. Explore the neighbors of node 3: Node 4 and Node 2 (since Node 2 is connected to Node 5 which connects back to Node 3).\n4. Since Node 2 is reached before any other potential paths, we stop here.\n\nFrom the exploration, the path from node 1 to node 2 is through node 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->3->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6]]} The end node: 2 The start node: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the start node to the end node in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Start at the start node (node 1).\n2. Explore all the direct neighbors of the current node.\n3. Mark each visited node to avoid revisiting it.\n4.
