In this case, since all edges are unweighted (they have equal weight), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the given node (node 3) and explore its neighbors.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: For each neighbor, record the path taken to reach it.\n3. **Continue Exploration**: Move to the next layer of nodes until reaching the destination node (node 9).\n4. **Backtrack to Construct Path**: Once the destination is reached, backtrack through the recorded paths to get the shortest path.\n\n### Implementation:\nLet's walk through the BFS process for this specific graph:\n\n1. Start at node 3.\n2. Explore neighbors of node 3: \n   - Node 3 is connected to node 2.\n3. From node 2, explore its neighbors:\n   - Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 6, and 14.\n   - Since we already visited node 3, move to node 6.\n4. From node 6, explore its neighbors:\n   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 7, and 11.\n   - Continue exploring nodes 4, 7, and 11.\n5.

From node 0, explore its neighbors:\n   - Node 0 is connected to nodes 8 and 12.\n   - Continue exploring nodes 8 and 12.\n9.
