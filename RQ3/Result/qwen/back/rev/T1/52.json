BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex. This ensures that when we reach the destination node, we have found the shortest path.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by marking the start node as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node and examine its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited:\n   - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n   - Record the path from the start node to this neighbor.\n   - Enqueue the neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: Continue until the queue is empty or the destination node is dequeued.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node as 1 and the destination node as 0.\n\n### Graph Representation:\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nEdges: [[0, 2], [0, 4], [0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 4], [5, 7], [6, 7]]\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1.

Dequeue node 4, explore its neighbors (none).\n5. Dequeue node 2, explore its neighbors (0):\n   - Enqueue node 0.\n6. Dequeue node 0, which is the destination node.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- From node 0, we trace back to node 2.\n- From node 2, we trace back to node 1.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 is: 1->4->0.\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluating the neighbors of node 1 and ensuring no shorter paths are missed, we find that the direct path to node 0 through node 2 is indeed the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->4->0. \n\n(Note: Upon rechecking, if node 2 is directly connected to node 0, the correct path would be 1->4->0, but if node 2 is not directly connected to node 0, the correct path should be 1->4->0.
