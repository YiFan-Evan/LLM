If yes, construct the path. If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n1. **Start**: Begin at node 7.\n2. **Neighbors of 7**: Nodes 3 and 1.\n3. **Enqueue** node 3 and node 1.\n4. **Dequeue** node 3. Neighbors are 7 and 12. Node 12 is not needed since we're looking for the shortest path to 1.\n5. **Dequeue** node 1.
