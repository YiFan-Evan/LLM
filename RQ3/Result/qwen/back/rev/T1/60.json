In this case, since all the edges have the same weight (assuming they are unweighted edges), BFS is appropriate because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Visit all its neighbors and mark them as visited.\n3. Move to the next level and repeat until you reach the target node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nEdges: [[0, 3], [0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]]\n\nStarting Node: 5\nTarget Node: 4\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize the queue with the start node (5).\n2. Explore the neighbors of 5:\n   - Neighbors of 5 are [4] (since 4 is directly connected to 5).\n3.

BFS is particularly suitable for unweighted graphs because it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, thereby ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\n### Fundamental Principles of BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start at the given start node (node 5).\n2. **Queue Operations**: Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. **Visited Tracking**: Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. **Path Recording**: Record the path taken to reach each node.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. Initialize the queue with the start node (5).\n2. Initialize a dictionary to record the parent of each node to reconstruct the path later.\n3.
