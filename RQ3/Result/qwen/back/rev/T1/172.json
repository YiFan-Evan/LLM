One of the most commonly used algorithms for this purpose is Dijkstra's algorithm. However, given that the graph is relatively small, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, which is simpler and works well for unweighted graphs.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: \n   - Nodes are represented by integers.\n   - Edges are represented as pairs of nodes.\n\n2. **Shortest Path Algorithms**:\n   - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: This algorithm is used for weighted graphs and finds the shortest path from the source to all other vertices.\n   - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This algorithm is used for unweighted graphs and finds the shortest path from the source to all other vertices.\n\nSince the problem does not specify if the graph is weighted, we will assume it is unweighted and use BFS to find the shortest path.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node during traversal.\n3. Traverse the graph level by level until the target node is found.\n4. Reconstruct the path from the target node back to the start node using the parent dictionary.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n\n1. Start at node `0`.\n2. Explore neighbors of node `0`: `[9, 19]`.\n3. Continue exploring neighbors of these nodes until reaching node `12`.\n\nLet's apply BFS step-by-step:\n\n1. Queue: `[0]`\n2.
