In this case, since no edge weights are provided, we'll assume they are all equal and use BFS.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start by placing the starting node into a queue.\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node.\n4. For each adjacent node that hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n5.

BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialize**: Create a queue and add the starting node (23) to it. Also, create a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node for reconstructing the path.\n2. **Mark Visited Nodes**: Mark the starting node as visited.\n3. **Process Queue**: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue. Also, record the current node as the parent of the neighbor.\n4. **Check Target Node**: If the dequeued node is the target node (22), stop the process and reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n1. Initialize the queue with node 23.\n2. Mark node 23 as visited and set its parent to None.\n3. Process the queue:\n   - Dequeue node 23.\n   - Explore neighbors: [20]. Add node 20 to the queue and set its parent to 23.\n   - Dequeue node 20.\n   - Explore neighbors: [9, 14, 15, 23]. Add node 15 to the queue and set its parent to 20.\n   - Dequeue node 15.\n   - Explore neighbors: [5, 12, 20]. Add node 21 to the queue and set its parent to 15.\n   - Dequeue node 21.\n   - Explore neighbors: [4, 10, 17, 19, 21]. Add node 22 to the queue and set its parent to 21.\n   - Dequeue node 22 (target reached).\n\n### Reconstruct Path:\n- Node 22\u2019s parent is 21.\n- Node 21\u2019s parent is 15.\n- Node 15\u2019s parent is 20.\n- Node 20\u2019s parent is 23.\n\nThus, the path from 23 to 22 is: 23 -> 20 -> 15 -> 21 -> 22.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 23->20->15->21->22."}]
