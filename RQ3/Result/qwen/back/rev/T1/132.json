In this case, since all edges are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice due to its simplicity and efficiency for such scenarios.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n1. **Graph Representation**: Nodes and edges define the structure of the graph.\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This algorithm explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It guarantees to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n3. **Queue Usage**: BFS uses a queue to manage the order of visiting nodes, ensuring that nodes are processed in the order they were discovered.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node.\n2. Use a dictionary to track the path from the start node to each visited node.\n3. Process each node by dequeuing it and checking if it is the target node.\n4. If not, enqueue all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet.\n5. Continue until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n\n- **Initialization**:\n  - Start node: 5\n  - Target node: 1\n  - Queue: [5]\n  - Path dictionary: {5: None}\n\n- **Processing**:\n  - Dequeue 5, enqueue its neighbors (12).\n    - Path dictionary: {5: None, 12: 5}\n  - Dequeue 12, enqueue its neighbors (7).\n    - Path dictionary: {5: None, 12: 5, 7: 12}\n  - Dequeue 7, enqueue its neighbors (11, 12).
