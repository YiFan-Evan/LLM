However, since the graph is relatively small, we can also solve this using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is simpler and equally effective for unweighted graphs.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start from the source node (node 4). Use a queue to perform BFS and a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node.\n2. **Exploration**: For each node, explore its neighbors. If a neighbor hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited and record the current node as its parent. Continue until you reach the target node (node 2).\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target node is reached, trace back through the recorded parents to construct the shortest path.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n\n- **Start at node 4**:\n  - Visited: {4}\n  - Parents: {4: None}\n  - Queue: [4]\n\n- **Node 4 has neighbors 0 and 7**:\n  - Visit node 0:\n    - Visited: {4, 0}\n    - Parents: {4: None, 0: 4}\n    - Queue: [0]\n  - Skip node 7 since it\u2019s not the target node.\n\n- **Node 0 has neighbors 5, 3, and 4**:\n  - Visit node 5:\n    - Visited: {4, 0, 5}\n    - Parents: {4: None, 0: 4, 5: 0}\n    - Queue: [0, 5]\n  - Visit node 3:\n    - Visited: {4, 0, 5, 3}\n    - Parents: {4: None, 0: 4, 5: 0, 3: 0}\n    - Queue: [0, 5, 3]\n\n- **Node 5 has neighbor 2**:\n  - Visit node 2:\n    - Visited: {4, 0, 5, 3, 2}\n    - Parents: {4: None, 0: 4, 5: 0, 3: 0, 2: 5}\n    - Queue: [0, 5, 3]\n\nWe have now reached the target node 2.
