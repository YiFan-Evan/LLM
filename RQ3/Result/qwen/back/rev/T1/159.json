Given that all the edges in the provided graph have equal weight (since no weights are specified), BFS is an appropriate choice as it efficiently finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4.
