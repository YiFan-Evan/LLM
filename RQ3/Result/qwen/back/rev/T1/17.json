In this case, since all edges are considered to have the same weight (i.e., they represent equal distances), BFS is a straightforward and efficient approach.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Then explore all the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on.\n4. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n5. When you reach the target node, you can trace back through the recorded paths to get the shortest path.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 1:\n\n1. Start at node 3.\n2. Visit all its neighbors (node 5).\n3. From node 5, visit its neighbors (none that haven't been visited already).\n4. Move to node 2 and visit its neighbors (node 5, already visited; node 6).\n5. From node 6, visit its neighbors (node 0, node 7).\n6. From node 0, visit its neighbors (node 1, our target).\n\nSo the path is:\n- Start at node 3.\n- Move to node 5.\n- Move to node 2.\n- Move to node 6.\n- Move to node 0.\n- Finally, move to node 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->5->2->6->0->1"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 6], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 5], [6, 7]]} The end node: 1 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is effective for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
