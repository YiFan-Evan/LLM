This algorithm works by initially setting the distance to the start node as zero and all other nodes as infinity. It then continuously selects the unvisited node with the smallest known distance, calculates the distance through it to each unvisited neighbor, and updates the neighbor's distance if the calculated distance is smaller.\n\nHowever, given the simplicity of this particular problem, we can also solve it using a breadth-first search (BFS), which is effective for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
