Set the start node as current.\n2. **Processing**: For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n3. **Selection**: Once all neighbors of the current node are considered, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\n4. **Iteration**: Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node\", and go back to step 2.\n\nLet's apply these steps to our specific problem:\n\nGiven graph:\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n- Edges: [[0, 10], [0, 2], [0, 12], [1, 11], [2, 11], [3, 7], [3, 5], [4, 6], [4, 14], [5, 10], [6, 13], [8, 13], [9, 11], [12, 13]]\n\nStart node: 9\nDestination: 2\n\n**Step-by-step application of Dijkstra's algorithm:**\n\n1.
