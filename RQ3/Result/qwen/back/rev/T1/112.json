In this case, since the edges do not have weights, BFS is a straightforward choice.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start by initializing a queue and adding the start node to it.\n2. Mark the start node as visited to avoid processing it multiple times.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node.\n   - If it is, construct the path and terminate the search.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n4. Repeat until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [5]\n   - Visited: {5}\n   - Path: {5: None}\n\n2. **Process Node 5**:\n   - Neighbors: [11]\n   - Add 11 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - Update path: {5: None, 11: 5}\n\n3. **Process Node 11**:\n   - Neighbors: [7]\n   - Add 7 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - Update path: {5: None, 11: 5, 7: 11}\n\n4. **Node 7 is the target node**:\n   - Terminate the search.\n\nNow, we can reconstruct the path from 5 to 7 using the recorded path:\n- 7 -> 11 -> 5\n\nHowever, the question asks for the path from 5 to 7, so we reverse the path to get the correct order:\n- 5 -> 11 -> 7\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->11->7"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 7], [0, 12], [1, 9], [2, 3], [3, 6], [4, 12], [5, 11], [6, 9], [7, 8], [7, 11], [9, 10]]} The end node: 7 The start node: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 5 to node 7 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
