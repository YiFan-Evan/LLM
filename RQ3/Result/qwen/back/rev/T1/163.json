Set it to zero for our initial node (node 8) and to infinity for all other nodes.\n   - Mark all nodes as unvisited. Set the initial node (node 8) as current.\n\n2. **Processing**:\n   - For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n   - Once all neighbors of the current node have been considered, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\n   - If the destination node (node 20) has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop.
