Here, we'll use BFS because the graph structure does not indicate any need for a weighted algorithm.\n\nThe BFS algorithm works by exploring all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that when we reach the destination, the path taken is the shortest one.\n\nSteps:\n1. Start from the node 14.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3.

Start at node 14.\n2. Neighbors of 14 are {19, 22, 21}.\n3. From 19: neighbors are {20, 21} (21 already visited).\n4. From 22: neighbors are {15, 13, 14} (14 already visited).\n5.
