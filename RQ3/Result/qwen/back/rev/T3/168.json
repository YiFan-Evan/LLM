This algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to explore, starting with the source node. It iteratively selects the node with the smallest tentative distance, explores its neighbors, and updates their distances if a shorter path is found.\n\nHere are the steps we will follow:\n\n1. Initialize distances to all nodes as infinity except for the starting node, which is set to zero.\n2. Use a priority queue to always expand the least costly node first.\n3. For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node.\n4. If a new calculated distance to a neighbor is less than the previously recorded distance, overwrite it.\n5.

Use a priority queue to manage the nodes based on their current shortest known distance.\n\n2. **Processing**: Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue (initially node 7).
