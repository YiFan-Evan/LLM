Since the graph provided does not specify any weights on the edges, we'll assume it's unweighted. BFS is simpler and more efficient for unweighted graphs.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Then explore all their neighbors, and so on.\n4. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n5. Stop when you reach the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 11.\n2. From node 11, we can go to nodes 0, 7, and 8.\n3.
