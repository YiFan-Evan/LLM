In this scenario, since all edges are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere are the steps to solve the problem using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Create a queue and add the start node to it. Use a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parent nodes to reconstruct the path later.\n2. **BFS Traversal**: Dequeue a node, check if it is the destination. If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited, storing their parent node.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the destination node is dequeued, use the parent information to trace back the path from the destination to the start node.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph.\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution\n\n- **Nodes**: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- **Edges**: [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 7], [2, 4], [2, 3], [3, 7], [6, 7]]\n- **Start Node**: 5\n- **Destination Node**: 4\n\n**Queue Initialization**: \n- Queue: [5]\n\n**BFS Traversal**:\n1.
