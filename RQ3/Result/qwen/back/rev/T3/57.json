BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, meaning it visits all the neighbors of a node before moving on to their neighbors. This makes BFS ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\nHere are the steps we follow:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\n2. Maintain a visited set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3. Track the path from the start node to each node using a dictionary.\n4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and check if it's the target node.\n5. If it\u2019s the target node, reconstruct the path from the start node to the target node using the tracking dictionary.\n6. Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- Edges: [[0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 4], [3, 6], [4, 5], [5, 6]]\n- Start node: 0\n- Destination node: 1\n\n**Step-by-step BFS Execution:**\n\n1.

However, since the direct connection from 0 to 1 is missing, we need to ensure all paths are correctly checked.\n\nAfter rechecking, the correct path involves visiting other nodes to find the shortest path.\n\n**Correct Path Reconstruction:**\n- Node 0 connects to node 6\n- Node 6 connects to node 3\n- Node 3 connects to node 6\n- Node 6 connects to node 1 (not directly but through intermediate nodes)\n\nHowever, the shortest path involves revisiting the queue correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->6->5->4->1"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 4], [3, 6], [4, 5], [5, 6]]} The start node: 0 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
