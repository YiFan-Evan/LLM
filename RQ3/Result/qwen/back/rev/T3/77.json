One such algorithm is Dijkstra's algorithm, which efficiently computes the shortest path in graphs with non-negative weights. However, given the simplicity of the provided graph, we can also solve this by inspection or using a breadth-first search (BFS), which is well-suited for unweighted graphs and finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nIn this case, we have an unweighted graph, so BFS is appropriate. BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\nLet's walk through the BFS approach:\n\n1. Start at node 1.\n2. Explore its neighbors: nodes 5 and 4.\n3. From node 5, explore its neighbor: node 6.\n4. From node 4, explore its neighbors: nodes 0 and 7.\n5. From node 7, explore its neighbor: node 2.\n\nFollowing these steps, we can see that the shortest path from node 1 to node 2 involves going through node 7. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->4->7->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 5], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [5, 6]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an ideal algorithm because it explores all the vertices of a given level before moving to the next level.
