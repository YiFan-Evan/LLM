Thus, BFS is a suitable algorithm for finding the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start from the initial node (in this case, node 6).\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Track the path taken to reach each node.\n4.
