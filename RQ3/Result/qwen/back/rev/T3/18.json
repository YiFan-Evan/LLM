In this case, since no weights are specified, we'll assume all edges have equal weight, and we'll use BFS for simplicity.\n\nBFS works by exploring all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path from the starting node.\n\nHere\u2019s how we apply BFS:\n\n1. Start at node 6.\n2. Explore all adjacent nodes (if any).\n3. Mark the current node as visited.\n4. Add the neighbors of the current node to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\n5. Repeat until the target node (2) is found or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's trace the BFS step-by-step:\n\n- Start at node 6.\n- From 6, go to 5 (since 6 -> 5 is the only edge connected to 6).\n- From 5, go to 3 (since 5 -> 3 is the only edge connected to 5).\n- From 3, go to 0 (since 3 -> 0 is one of the edges connected to 3).\n- From 0, go to 1 (since 0 -> 1 is one of the edges connected to 0).\n- From 0, also go to 7 (since 0 -> 7 is one of the edges connected to 0).\n- From 7, go to 4 (since 7 -> 4 is the only edge connected to 7).\n- From 0, we can also go directly to 3, but we already visited 3 through 5.\n- From 0, we can also go directly to 7, but we already visited 7 through 0.\n- Now, from 0, go to 1 (already visited).\n- From 1, go to 0 (already visited).\n- From 1, there are no other edges to explore.\n- From 3, we already visited 5.\n- From 3, go to 0 (already visited).\n- From 3, there are no other edges to explore.\n- From 4, go to 7 (already visited).\n- From 4, there are no other edges to explore.\n- From 7, go to 4 (already visited).\n- From 7, there are no other edges to explore.\n- Finally, from 0, go to 3 (already visited).\n- From 0, go to 7 (already visited).\n\nWe see that the shortest path from 6 to 2 goes through 5 -> 3 -> 0 -> 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->5->3->0->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 3], [0, 7], [2, 5], [3, 5], [4, 7], [5, 6]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
