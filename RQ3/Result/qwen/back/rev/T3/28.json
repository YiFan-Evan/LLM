Given that all edges have equal weight in this graph (no weights are specified), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level and ensures that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize**: Start BFS from the given start node.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: For each node, explore its neighbors in the order they were discovered.\n3. **Track Path**: Maintain a record of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Stop Condition**: Stop once the target node is found.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n1. Start at node 6.\n2. Explore its neighbors: Node 3.\n3. Explore neighbors of node 3: Node 5.\n4. Explore neighbors of node 5: Node 1.\n5.

BFS is particularly useful for unweighted graphs like this one, as it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path.\n\n### Steps of BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start from the source node (node 6) and mark it as visited.\n2. **Queue Initialization**: Add the start node to the queue.\n3. **Exploration**:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - Check if it\u2019s the target node (node 1).\n   - If not, enqueue all its neighbors that haven\u2019t been visited yet.\n4. **Path Tracking**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n1.
