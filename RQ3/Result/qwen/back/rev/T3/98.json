Since all the edges in this graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's perform BFS starting from node 8 to reach node 9:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (8) to it.\n2. Maintain a dictionary to keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n3.

BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex. This ensures that when we reach our destination node, we have found the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step BFS process for finding the shortest path from node 8 to node 2:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Start with the node 8.\n   - Use a queue to manage the nodes to be processed.\n   - Keep track of the path taken to reach each node using a dictionary.\n\n2. **Queue Initialization**:\n   - Start with node 8. Enqueue node 8.\n   - Initialize the path dictionary: {8: None}\n\n3. **Processing Nodes**:\n   - Dequeue node 8.\n   - Enqueue its neighbors: 0, 2, and 9 (if not already visited).\n   - Update the path dictionary accordingly.\n\n4. **Continue Processing**:\n   - Dequeue node 0. Its neighbors (7, 10) are not the target.\n   - Dequeue node 2. It matches the target node 2. Record the path.\n\nBy following these steps, we can determine the shortest path:\n\n- Dequeue 8: Enqueue 0, 2, 9.\n- Dequeue 0: No new nodes to enqueue.\n- Dequeue 2: Target node reached.\n\nThe path recorded shows that we got from 8 to 2 directly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->2"}]
