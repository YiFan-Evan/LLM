However, given the relatively small size of the graph, we can also use a simple breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path because BFS guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Mark nodes as visited to avoid revisiting them.\n4. Keep track of the path leading to each node to reconstruct the shortest path once the target node is reached.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\n- Edges: [[0, 1], [1, 7], [1, 9], [1, 12], [2, 10], [3, 6], [3, 9], [4, 11], [4, 9], [5, 7], [6, 8], [8, 10]]\n- Start node: 3\n- Destination node: 9\n\nStarting BFS from node 3:\n1.
