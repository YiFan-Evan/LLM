This algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of paths, ordered by their length. It starts from the source node and explores the neighboring nodes, updating the shortest path to each node encountered. \n\nHowever, for simplicity and given the relatively small size of the graph provided, we can also solve this using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is suitable for unweighted graphs like the one provided here.

None of these lead directly to node 8.\n- Continue exploring further:\n  - Node 4 leads to node 7, which does not help.\n  - Node 14 leads to node 9 and node 11, neither of which are useful.\n- Moving back to node 2, we see that node 2 also connects to node 14. \n- From node 14, checking its connections again, node 14 connects to node 9.\n- Node 9 connects to node 8.\n\nThus, the shortest path found through this exploration is: 2 -> 14 -> 9 -> 8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->14->9->8"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 8], [0, 13], [0, 1], [1, 14], [2, 4], [2, 14], [3, 6], [4, 7], [5, 6], [5, 10], [6, 12], [8, 10], [9, 14], [11, 14]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 2 to node 9, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
