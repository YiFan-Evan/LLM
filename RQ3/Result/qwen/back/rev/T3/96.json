BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all neighbors of the current node.\n3. Add the neighbors to a queue for further exploration.\n4. Move to the next node in the queue and repeat until the destination node is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4:\n\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (5).\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each visited node.\n3. Traverse through the graph using BFS until we reach the destination node (4).\n\nLet's execute the steps:\n\n- Start at node 5.\n- Visit its neighbors (only 12).\n- Visit node 12's neighbors (6, 12). Node 12 has already been visited.\n- Visit node 6's neighbors (12, 7, 4).
