Start from the source node (node 1).\n2. Explore its neighbors.\n3. Mark the current node as visited and add its unvisited neighbors to the queue.\n4. Continue exploring until the destination node (node 10) is reached.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 1.\n2. From node 1, explore its neighbor which is node 9.\n3. From node 9, explore its neighbors: nodes 17, 20, and 24.\n4. None of these neighbors lead directly to node 10, so continue.\n5. From node 9, explore node 24, and then explore its neighbors.\n6.
