In this case, since all edges have the same weight (assuming they are unweighted), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start by initializing a queue and add the starting node.\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and check if it is the target node.\n4.
