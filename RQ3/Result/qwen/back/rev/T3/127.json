Both algorithms are designed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph or a graph where all edge weights are the same.\n\nHere, we'll use BFS because the graph does not specify any edge weights, and BFS is simpler and more efficient for such cases.\n\nSteps for BFS:\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node.\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parent nodes to reconstruct the path.\n3. Dequeue a node, check if it\u2019s the target node.\n4. If not, enqueue all its neighbors that haven\u2019t been visited yet.\n5. Repeat until the target node is dequeued or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. Start at node 10.\n2. Enqueue node 10 and initialize a visited dictionary: {10: None}.\n3. Dequeue node 10. Its neighbors are 8 and 11.\n   - Add neighbor 8 to the queue with parent 10: {10: None, 8: 10}.\n   - Add neighbor 11 to the queue with parent 10: {10: None, 8: 10, 11: 10}.\n4.

Its neighbors are 4 (already visited) and 13.\n   - Neighbor 13 is added to the queue with parent 12: {10: None, 8: 10, 11: 10, 4: 8, 14: 11, 12: 4, 3: 14, 13: 12}.\n9. Dequeue node 3. Its neighbors are 0 and 14 (already visited).\n   - Neighbor 0 is added to the queue with parent 3: {10: None, 8: 10, 11: 10, 4: 8, 14: 11, 12: 4, 3: 14, 13: 12, 0: 3}.\n10. Dequeue node 13.
