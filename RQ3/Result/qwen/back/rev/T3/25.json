However, since our graph does not have weights on the edges, we assume all edges have equal weight (i.e., 1). Here are the steps we follow:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Set the distance to the start node (node 2) to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.\n   - Create a priority queue (or a simple queue if all weights are equal) and insert the start node.\n\n2. **Processing Nodes**:\n   - While the queue is not empty, extract the node with the smallest distance.\n   - For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the tentative distance through the current node.\n   - If this tentative distance is less than the known distance to the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and add it to the queue.\n\n### Applying Dijkstra's Algorithm:\n\n1. **Start Node (2)**:\n   - Distance to node 2: 0\n   - Distance to node 7: 1\n\n2. **Next Nearest Node**:\n   - Node 7 has the smallest distance.\n   - Distance to node 0: 2 (through node 7)\n   - Distance to node 5: 2 (through node 7)\n\n3. **Next Nearest Node**:\n   - Node 5 has the smallest distance.\n   - Distance to node 6: 3 (through node 5)\n   - Distance to node 7: 2 (already visited)\n\n4. **Next Nearest Node**:\n   - Node 0 has the smallest distance.\n   - Distance to node 7: 2 (already visited)\n\n5. **Next Nearest Node**:\n   - Node 4 has the smallest distance.\n   - Distance to node 3: 2 (through node 4)\n   - Distance to node 5: 2 (already visited)\n\nNow we have the shortest path to node 4, which is via node 7 and then directly to node 4.\n\n### Tracing Back the Path:\n- Node 4 connects directly to node 3.\n- Node 4 connects to node 5.\n- Node 5 connects to node 7.\n- Node 7 connects to node 2.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 2 to node 4 involves the nodes in the order: 2 -> 7 -> 4.\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is:\n2->7->4"}]
