However, since no edge weights are provided in the problem, we'll assume all edges have equal weight.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the graph using the given nodes and edges.\n2. **Initialization**: Set up the necessary data structures. We will use a set to keep track of visited nodes and a dictionary to store the shortest paths from the start node to each node.\n3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n   - Start from the source node (node 6).\n   - Visit each node connected to the current node, updating the shortest path to those nodes if a shorter path is found.\n   - Mark the current node as visited.\n   - Repeat until the destination node (node 5) is reached or all reachable nodes are visited.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the destination node is reached, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the destination node to the start node using the stored shortest paths.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given graph.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution\n\n1. **Graph Representation**:\n   - Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n   - Edges: [[0, 4], [0, 3], [0, 7], [1, 11], [2, 5], [2, 11], [3, 11], [6, 12], [6, 7], [7, 14], [8, 13], [8, 12], [9, 13], [10, 12]]\n\n2. **Initialization**:\n   - Current Node: 6\n   - Visited Nodes: {}\n   - Shortest Paths: {6: [6]}\n\n3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:\n   - From node 6, we can go to nodes 7 and 12.\n   - Check neighbors of node 7: node 14 (no direct path to 5).\n   - Check neighbors of node 12: nodes 8 and 10.\n     - Node 8 connects to node 13 (no direct path to 5).\n     - Node 10 connects to node 12 (already visited).\n   - Check neighbors of node 2 (since 2 connects directly to 5):\n     - Node 2 connects to nodes 5 and 11.\n     - Node 5 is our destination.\n\nSince node 5 is directly reachable from node 2, we can conclude that the shortest path from node 6 to node 5 involves going through node 2.\n\n4. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - From node 6 to node 7 to node 12 to node 8 to node 13 (no path to 5).\n   - From node 6 to node 7 to node 14 (no path to 5).\n   - From node 6 to node 12 to node 8 to node 13 (no path to 5).\n   - From node 6 to node 12 to node 10 (no path to 5).\n   -
