Create a set of unvisited nodes.\n2. **Selection**: Select the unvisited node with the smallest known distance from the start node.\n3. **Relaxation**: For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. If this calculated distance is less than the previously recorded distance, update the shorter distance.\n4. **Mark as visited**: Once we have considered all the neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited.\n5. **Repeat**: Repeat the process until all nodes are visited or until we reach the destination node.\n\nNow, let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph with the start node 8 and the destination node 12.\n\n### Step-by-Step Application\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Distances: {8: 0, 1: \u221e, 2: \u221e, 3: \u221e, 4: \u221e, 5: \u221e, 6: \u221e, 7: \u221e, 9: \u221e, 10: \u221e, 11: \u221e, 12: \u221e, 13: \u221e, 14: \u221e}\n   - Unvisited nodes: {8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14}\n\n2. **First Selection**:\n   - Current node: 8\n   - Neighbors: 7, 9, 4\n   - Update distances:\n     - Distance to 7: min(\u221e, 0 + weight(8, 7)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n     - Distance to 9: min(\u221e, 0 + weight(8, 9)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n     - Distance to 4: min(\u221e, 0 + weight(8, 4)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n\n3. **Second Selection**:\n   - Current node: 9 (smallest known distance)\n   - Neighbors: 4, 11\n   - Update distances:\n     - Distance to 4: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(9, 4)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n     - Distance to 11: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(9, 11)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n\n4. **Third Selection**:\n   - Current node: 4 (smallest known distance)\n   - Neighbors: 9, 8, 7, 14\n   - Update distances:\n     - Distance to 9: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(4, 9)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n     - Distance to 8: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(4, 8)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n     - Distance to 7: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(4, 7)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n     - Distance to 14: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(4, 14)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n\n5. **Fourth Selection**:\n   - Current node: 7 (smallest known distance)\n   - Neighbors: 6, 10\n   - Update distances:\n     - Distance to 6: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(7, 6)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n     - Distance to 10: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(7, 10)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n\n6. **Fifth Selection**:\n   - Current node: 10 (smallest known distance)\n   - Neighbors: 13\n   - Update distances:\n     - Distance to 13: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(10, 13)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n\n7. **Sixth Selection**:\n   - Current node: 13 (smallest known distance)\n   - Neighbors: 1, 10\n   - Update distances:\n     - Distance to 1: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(13, 1)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n     - Distance to 10: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(13, 10)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n\n8. **Seventh Selection**:\n   - Current node: 1 (smallest known distance)\n   - Neighbors: 13\n   - Update distances:\n     - Distance to 13: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(1, 13)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n\n9. **Eighth Selection**:\n   - Current node: 2 (smallest known distance)\n   - Neighbors: 9\n   - Update distances:\n     - Distance to 9: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(2, 9)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n\n10. **Ninth Selection**:\n    - Current node: 5 (smallest known distance)\n    - Neighbors: 12\n    - Update distances:\n      - Distance to 12: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(5, 12)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n\n11. **Tenth Selection**:\n    - Current node: 12 (smallest known distance)\n    - Neighbors: 5\n    - Update distances:\n      - Distance to 5: min(\u221e, \u221e + weight(12, 5)) = min(\u221e, \u221e) = \u221e\n\nSince we have reached the destination node 12, we can trace back the shortest path using the distances and previous nodes.\n\n### Trace Back the Path\n- From node 12, the previous node is 5.\n- From node 5, the previous node is 12.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 8 to node 12 is: **8->5->12**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **8->5->12**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 11], [1, 13], [2, 9], [3, 12], [4, 9], [4, 8], [4, 7], [4, 14], [5, 12], [5, 8], [6, 7], [7, 10], [9, 11], [10, 13]]} The start node: 8 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 8 to node 5 in the given graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm.
