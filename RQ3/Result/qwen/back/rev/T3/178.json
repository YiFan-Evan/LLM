However, since the given graph is relatively small and simple, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps we would follow:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start at the source node (node 6). Mark this node as visited.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Visit all the neighboring nodes of the current node and mark the distance from the source node. If the neighbor is already visited, skip it.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until we reach the target node (node 4).\n4. **Backtrack**: Once the target node is reached, trace back the path by following the parent pointers.\n\nLet's apply these steps to our specific graph:\n\n1. Start at node 6.\n2. Explore neighbors:\n   - Node 6 is connected to node 21.\n3. From node 21, explore its neighbors:\n   - Node 21 is connected to nodes 5, 7, and 18.\n4.
