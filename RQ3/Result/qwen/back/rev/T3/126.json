In this case, since the graph does not specify any weights on the edges, we'll assume they are equal. BFS is particularly suitable for this scenario because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start by adding the start node to a queue.\n2. Mark the start node as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node.\n4. For each adjacent node that has not been visited yet, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n5. If the dequeued node is the destination node, stop the search.\n6. Continue until the queue is empty or the destination node is found.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 9 to node 10:\n\n1. Start with node 9.\n2. Enqueue node 9.\n3. Dequeue node 9. Its neighbors are nodes 13 and 14. Enqueue both.\n4. Dequeue node 13. Its neighbors are nodes 9 and 14. Node 9 is already visited; enqueue node 14.\n5. Dequeue node 14. Its neighbors are nodes 9 and 13. Both are already visited.\n6. Dequeue node 13 again (since it was enqueued earlier). This time, check its other neighbor, node 9. It is already visited.\n7. Now, consider the neighbors of node 13 again and notice that node 9 has already been visited. Move on to other paths.\n8. Since we haven't reached node 10, continue exploring the neighbors of nodes that have been enqueued.\n9. Consider node 14. Its neighbors are nodes 9 and 13. Both are already visited.\n10. Reconsider node 9 and move to its neighbors (not necessary since we already explored them).\n11. Finally, explore node 13 again and its neighbors. We see that node 9 is already visited. So, consider node 13's other neighbor, node 14, which is also visited.\n12. Notice that node 10 is not directly connected to nodes 9 or 13 but is connected to node 11 via node 10. \n13. Explore the neighbors of node 11, which includes node 10.\n\nBy following these steps, we identify the path from node 9 to node 10 via node 13 and node 11.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->13->11->10"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 6], [1, 2], [1, 4], [3, 10], [4, 10], [5, 8], [5, 13], [6, 8], [7, 11], [9, 13], [9, 14], [10, 11], [11, 12]]} The start node: 9 The destination: 11"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
