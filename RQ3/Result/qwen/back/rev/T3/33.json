Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the current depth level.\n3. Move to the next depth level and repeat until the target node is found.\n4.

Node 5 connects to nodes 7 and 0. We choose node 0 since 7 is not our target.\n2. From node 0, we can go to nodes 3 and 5. We already visited 5, so we visit 3.\n3.

BFS is particularly suitable for unweighted graphs like the one given, where all edges have equal weight. BFS explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path from the starting node.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the start node (5) and mark it as visited. Use a queue to manage the nodes to be explored.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Dequeue a node and explore its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n3. **Track Path**: Maintain a record of the path taken to reach each node to reconstruct the shortest path once the destination node (3) is reached.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n1. **Start at node 5**.\n   - Visited nodes: {5}\n   - Queue: [5]\n\n2. **Dequeue node 5**.\n   - Neighbors of 5: [0, 7]\n   - Mark 0 and 7 as visited.\n   - Queue: [0, 7]\n\n3. **Dequeue node 0**.\n   - Neighbors of 0: [3, 5]\n   - Node 5 is already visited, so only add 3 to the queue.\n   - Queue: [7, 3]\n\n4. **Dequeue node 7**.\n   - Neighbors of 7: [5] (but 5 is already visited)\n   - No new nodes added to the queue.\n   - Queue: [3]\n\n5. **Dequeue node 3**.\n   - Node 3 is the target node.\n   - Stop the search.\n\n### Reconstructing the Path:\n- To reconstruct the path, backtrack from the target node (3) to the start node (5).\n- Path: 5 -> 0 -> 3\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->0->3."}]
