In this case, since all edges are unweighted, BFS is an appropriate choice as it explores all vertices at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. This ensures finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nWe'll apply BFS to explore the graph layer by layer, starting from the node 1 until we reach node 5.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can do it step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Start at node 1.\n   - Maintain a queue for BFS traversal.\n   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the path from the start node to any other node.\n\n2. **BFS Traversal**:\n   - Enqueue the start node.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node that hasn\u2019t been visited yet, mark the path and enqueue the neighbor.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Once the destination node (node 5) is reached, reconstruct the path using the recorded paths.\n\nLet's perform the BFS:\n\n- Start at node 1.\n- Neighbors of node 1 are [3, 6, 7].
