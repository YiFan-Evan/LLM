Since the graph described does not specify weights on the edges, we can assume it is unweighted.\n\nHere, we'll use BFS because it's simpler and more intuitive for unweighted graphs. BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex. This ensures that when we reach our destination, we have found the shortest path.\n\nSteps for BFS:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\n2. Maintain a visited set to keep track of visited nodes and avoid cycles.\n3. Keep a dictionary to store the path taken to reach each node.\n4. Dequeue a node, check if it is the target node. If yes, reconstruct the path. If not, enqueue all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet, marking them as visited and storing how we got there.\n5. Repeat until the queue is empty or the target node is reached.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 6.\n2. Enqueue neighbors of 6 (only node 5 since edge [5,6] exists).\n3. Move to node 5, enqueue its neighbors (none directly connected to 6 except 6 itself).\n4. Backtrack to 6, now enqueue node 5's other neighbor, which is node 6 again (but it's already visited).\n5. Now visit node 5's other connection (node 6), but it\u2019s already explored.\n6. Next, explore node 6's other connection, node 1, but it doesn\u2019t lead directly to 2.\n7. Continue exploring connections from 1, eventually reaching node 3, but still no direct path to 2.\n8. Explore further, eventually reaching node 0, but still no path to 2.\n9. Finally, we need to look at the paths leading directly or indirectly to node 2. Node 2 is directly connected to node 4.\n\nFollowing the steps, we find the shortest path from node 6 to node 2 involves going through node 5 and then node 6 again before reaching node 4 and finally node 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->5->6->4->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 1], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 7], [4, 7], [5, 6]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is appropriate here because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph by exploring all the vertices level by level.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works step-by-step:\n1. Start at the source node (6).\n2. Visit all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. Mark these neighbors as visited and add them to a queue.\n4. Move to the next node in the queue and repeat the process.\n5. Stop once the target node (4) is reached.\n\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 6.\n2.

Node 1 has two neighbors: node 3 and node 0.\n   Queue: [3, 0]\n6. Dequeue node 3, and add its neighbors to the queue. Node 3 has one neighbor: node 7.\n   Queue: [0, 7]\n7. Dequeue node 0, and add its neighbors to the queue. Node 0 has two neighbors: node 6 (already visited) and node 1 (already visited).\n   Queue: [7]\n8.
