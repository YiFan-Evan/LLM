This process continues until the destination node is reached or the queue is empty.\n\nHere are the steps involved:\n\n1. Initialize the distance to all nodes as infinity except for the start node, which is set to zero.\n2. Set up a priority queue and insert the start node with a distance of zero.\n3.
