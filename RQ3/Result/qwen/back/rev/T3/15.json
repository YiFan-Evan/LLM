Since all the edges in the given graph have equal weight, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Move to the next level of nodes (neighbors of neighbors) until reaching the target node.\n4. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 2.\n2. Explore its neighbors: nodes 6 and 4.\n3. From node 6, explore its neighbors: nodes 3 and 7. However, node 3 does not lead directly to the target node 5.\n4. From node 4, explore its neighbor: node 7. Node 7 is not the target either.\n5. Now backtrack and explore from node 3, which is a neighbor of node 6. Node 3 has neighbors 5 and 6, but we already explored node 6.\n6.
