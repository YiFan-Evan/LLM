Given that all edges have equal weight in this case, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere are the steps for using BFS to solve this problem:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node (node 4) to it.\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the distance from the start node to each node and the path taken to reach each node.\n3.

BFS explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This makes BFS ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, where the shortest path is defined as the one with the least number of edges.\n\nLet's outline the BFS process:\n1. Start by initializing a queue and adding the starting node (node 4).\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each node to reconstruct the path once the target node is found.\n3. Begin processing nodes in the queue:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node, if the neighbor hasn't been visited yet:\n     - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n     - Add the neighbor to the queue.\n     - Record the parent of the neighbor as the dequeued node.\n4.
