Since the given graph does not have any edge weights (all edges are assumed to have equal weight), BFS is a suitable choice for finding the shortest path.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialize:** Start by marking the starting node (node 1) as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Traverse:** Dequeue a node and check if it is the destination node (node 2). If it is, stop and reconstruct the path. Otherwise, enqueue all its neighbors that have not been visited yet.\n3. **Repeat:** Continue the process until the destination node is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's apply BFS:\n\n- Start at node 1.\n- Enqueue node 1.\n- Dequeue node 1, mark it as visited.\n- Node 1 has neighbors 3 and 7. Enqueue node 3 and node 7.\n- Dequeue node 3, mark it as visited.\n- Node 3 has neighbors 0 and 4. Node 0 is not our target; enqueue node 4.\n- Node 4 is not our target; continue.\n- Dequeue node 7, mark it as visited.\n- Node 7 has no direct neighbor to the target node 2.\n- Dequeue node 2 (not possible since it was not enqueued yet).\n- Dequeue node 5 (not possible since it was not enqueued yet).\n- Node 2 is not directly reachable from node 1 via the above steps.\n\nWe missed node 2 in the previous steps. Let's recheck neighbors of node 3:\n- Node 3 has neighbors 0 and 4. We need to look further.\n- Node 2 is connected to node 5 which is connected to node 6, but we need to backtrack to node 2.\n\nCorrect Path:\n- Node 1 -> Node 3 -> Node 2\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->3->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem of finding the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
