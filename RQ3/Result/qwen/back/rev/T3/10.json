In this case, since all edges are unweighted (they have the same cost), BFS is the most straightforward and efficient algorithm to use.\n\n### Principles Involved:\n1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** This algorithm explores nodes level by level, starting from the root (or source node). It uses a queue to keep track of the next nodes to visit.\n2. **Queue:** A data structure where elements are processed in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.\n3. **Visited Set:** A set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them and getting stuck in cycles.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (1).\n2. Use a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path later.\n3. Start processing nodes from the queue until the destination node (0) is found or the queue is empty.\n4. For each node, explore its neighbors. If a neighbor hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited and enqueue it, storing the current node as its parent.\n5. Once the destination node is reached, trace back through the parent dictionary to get the shortest path.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n1. Start at node 1.\n2. Explore neighbors of node 1: nodes 6 and 7. Enqueue node 6 and node 7.\n3. Dequeue node 6 and explore its neighbors (none). Dequeue node 7 and explore its neighbors (none).\n4. Revisit node 1 and dequeue its other neighbor, node 2. Explore neighbors of node 2: node 0. Enqueue node 0.\n5. Dequeue node 0, which is our destination.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- Node 0 has node 2 as its parent.\n- Node 2 has node 1 as its parent.\n- Therefore, the path is 1 -> 2 -> 0.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2->0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is particularly useful for unweighted graphs because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path from the starting node.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. Start from the initial node (node 1).\n2. Use a queue to manage the nodes to be explored.\n3. Use a visited set to keep track of nodes that have already been explored.\n4. Track the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination node (node 2) is found.\n5. Enqueue the neighbors of the current node if they haven't been visited.\n6. Continue this process until the destination node is dequeued.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n1. Start at node 1.\n2. Add neighbors of node 1 (nodes 6 and 7) to the queue.\n3. Dequeue node 6 and explore its neighbors (none). Dequeue node 7 and explore its neighbors (none).\n4. Revisit node 1 and enqueue its other neighbor, node 0. \n5.
