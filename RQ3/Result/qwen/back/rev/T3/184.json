However, given the small size of the graph, we can also perform a breadth-first search (BFS), which is simpler and equally effective for unweighted graphs.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start at the source node (node 0).\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited and add it to a queue.\n4. Repeat the process for the next node in the queue until you reach the destination node (node 1).\n\nLet's go through the BFS step-by-step:\n\n- Start at node 0.\n- Node 0 has neighbors 9, 20, 4, and 7.
