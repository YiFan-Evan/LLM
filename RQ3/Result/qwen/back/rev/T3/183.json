Given that all edges have equal weight in this graph, BFS is an efficient choice.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n\n1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This algorithm explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order. It starts at the source node and explores all the neighboring nodes before moving to the next level of nodes. BFS guarantees the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores nodes level by level.\n\n2. **Queue Data Structure**: BFS uses a queue to keep track of which nodes to explore next. Nodes are added to the queue as they are discovered, and the queue ensures that nodes closer to the starting point are explored first.\n\n3. **Parent Tracking**: To reconstruct the path from the destination back to the start, we maintain a parent dictionary where each key is a node and its value is the node's parent. This helps us trace back the shortest path once we reach the destination.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node.\n2.
