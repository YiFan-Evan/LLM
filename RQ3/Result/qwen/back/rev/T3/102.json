Given that all edges are unweighted, BFS is a simpler and efficient choice.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Then explore all the neighbors of those neighbors.\n4. Continue this process until you reach the destination node.\n5. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node to reconstruct the shortest path.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 10 to node 9:\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution\n\n1. **Initialize BFS:**\n   - Queue: [10]\n   - Visited nodes: {}\n   - Parent dictionary: {10: None}\n\n2. **Expand node 10:**\n   - Neighbors of 10: [6]\n   - Queue: [6]\n   - Visited nodes: {10}\n   - Parent dictionary: {10: None, 6: 10}\n\n3. **Expand node 6:**\n   - Neighbors of 6: [1]\n   - Queue: [1]\n   - Visited nodes: {10, 6}\n   - Parent dictionary: {10: None, 6: 10, 1: 6}\n\n4. **Expand node 1:**\n   - Neighbors of 1: [9, 10, 8]\n   - Since 9 is the target node, we stop here.\n   - Queue: []\n   - Visited nodes: {10, 6, 1}\n   - Parent dictionary: {10: None, 6: 10, 1: 6, 9: 1}\n\nNow we have reached the destination node 9.

BFS is particularly suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. Start at the source node (10).\n2. Enqueue the source node.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - If this node is the destination node (1), then we've found the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n4.
