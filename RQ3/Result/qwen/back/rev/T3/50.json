BFS is particularly suitable for unweighted graphs since it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can apply BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by marking the start node (1) as visited and add it to a queue.\n2. **Exploration**: For each node, explore its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n3. **Path Recording**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.
