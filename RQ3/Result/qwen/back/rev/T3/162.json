One of the most common and efficient algorithms for this purpose is Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm works well when all edge weights are non-negative.\n\nHere, since no specific weights are provided, we assume all edges have equal weight (i.e., they represent the same distance or cost). Therefore, we can treat this problem as finding the shortest path in terms of the fewest number of edges.\n\nWe will apply a breadth-first search (BFS), which is well-suited for unweighted graphs or graphs where all edges have the same weight.
