In this case, since all the edges are unweighted (i.e., they all have the same weight), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level and guarantees the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n4. Continue until the target node is found.\n\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 7.\n2. From node 7, explore its neighbors (only node 11).\n3. From node 11, explore its neighbors (nodes 9 and 12).\n4. From node 9, explore its neighbors (nodes 4 and 11, but 11 has already been visited).\n5. From node 4, explore its neighbors (nodes 9, 10, and 4, but 9 and 4 have already been visited).\n6. From node 10, explore its neighbors (nodes 1, 4, and 6, but 4 and 6 have not been visited yet).\n7. From node 6, explore its neighbors (nodes 8 and 10, but 10 has already been visited).\n8. From node 8, explore its neighbors (nodes 5 and 6, but 6 has already been visited).\n9. From node 5, explore its neighbors (node 8, which has already been visited).\n10. From node 1, explore its neighbors (nodes 3 and 10, but 10 has already been visited).\n\nWe finally reach node 1.
