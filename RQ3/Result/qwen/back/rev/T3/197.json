In this case, since all the edges can be assumed to have equal weight, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize**: Start by marking the start node (node 1) as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Explore**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the destination (node 22). If not, explore its neighbors.\n3. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path from the start node to each node as you go.\n4. **Repeat**: Continue until the destination node is found.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n\n1.

BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach a vertex, it is via the shortest path from the source.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a queue and adding the start node (node 1) to it. Mark node 1 as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the destination node (node 23). If not, explore its neighbors and add unvisited neighbors to the queue while marking them as visited.\n3. **Path Tracking**: Track the path from the start node to each node as you go.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n\n1.
