In this case, since all edges have the same weight (we assume they are unweighted), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest path.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start from the source node.\n2. Explore its neighbors.\n3. Then explore all the neighbors of those neighbors.\n4. Continue this process until the destination node is found.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nEdges: [[0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]\n\nStarting node: 1\nDestination node: 3\n\n**Step-by-step BFS:**\n1. Start at node 1.\n2. Explore its neighbor, which is node 3.\n\nSince we directly reach node 3 from node 1, we don't need to explore further nodes.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 is: **1->3**\n\nSo, the final answer is: **1->3**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 3**\n\nSo, the final answer is: **1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous response.
