Given the relatively small size of the graph, BFS is a straightforward and efficient method to determine the shortest path since all edge weights are equal.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works for this problem:\n1. Start at the initial node (node 4).\n2. Explore all neighboring nodes.\n3. Move to the next level of nodes and continue until reaching the target node (node 6).\n4. Trace back the path from the target node to the start node.\n\nLet's explore the paths step-by-step:\n\n1. Start at node 4.\n2. From node 4, we can move to:\n   - Node 3 (not needed since it doesn't lead directly to 6)\n   - Node 6 (directly leads to the target node)\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 4 to node 6 is direct via node 6 itself.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->6"}]
