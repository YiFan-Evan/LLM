However, since the problem does not specify any edge weights and all edges can be considered to have equal weight, we can simplify our approach by using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is suitable here because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring that the first time we reach the destination node, it will be via the shortest path.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can apply BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial node (node 9) and set up a queue for BFS. Also, keep track of the path to each node.\n2. **Exploration**: Process each node in the queue. For each node, explore its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited yet, add it to the queue and record the path leading to it.\n3. **Termination**: Stop when we reach the destination node (node 3).\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Initialize:\n   - Current node: 9\n   - Queue: [9]\n   - Path tracking: {9: [9]}\n\n2. Process node 9:\n   - Neighbors of 9: [0]\n   - Add 0 to the queue: [0]\n   - Update path tracking: {9: [9], 0: [9, 0]}\n\n3. Process node 0:\n   - Neighbors of 0: [9, 6]\n   - Since 9 is already visited, add 6 to the queue: [6]\n   - Update path tracking: {9: [9], 0: [9, 0], 6: [9, 0, 6]}\n\n4.
