Since all the edges in this graph have equal weight, BFS is sufficient for our purpose.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: \n   - Nodes are represented by integers.\n   - Edges are pairs of nodes that are connected.\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n   - BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is via the shortest path from the starting node.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. Start from the source node and mark it as visited.\n2. Enqueue the source node.\n3. Dequeue a node and visit all its unvisited neighbors. Mark them as visited and enqueue them.\n4. Repeat until the queue is empty or the target node is dequeued.\n\n### Applying BFS to the Problem:\n- **Start Node**: 6\n- **Destination Node**: 10\n\nLet's trace the BFS process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initial State**:\n   - Queue: [6]\n   - Visited: {6}\n\n2. **First Iteration**:\n   - Dequeue 6.\n   - Neighbors of 6: [0]\n   - Enqueue 0.\n   - Visited: {6, 0}\n   - Queue: [0]\n\n3. **Second Iteration**:\n   - Dequeue 0.\n   - Neighbors of 0: [6, 10]\n   - Since 10 is not visited, enqueue it.\n   - Visited: {6, 0, 10}\n   - Queue: [10]\n\nSince we have reached the destination node (10) during the second iteration, we stop here.\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is: 6->0->10"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 10], [1, 8], [2, 7], [3, 12], [4, 7], [5, 11], [5, 8], [7, 10], [7, 8], [7, 9], [9, 12]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node using Breadth-First Search (BFS), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the given start node (6) and create a queue for BFS.
