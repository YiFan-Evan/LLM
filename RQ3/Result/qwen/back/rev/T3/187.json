This algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of paths, ordered by their total weight. It starts at the source node and explores the neighboring nodes, updating the shortest path to each node as it progresses.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how we would apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given problem:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start at node 12. Set the distance to all other nodes as infinity (\u221e) except for the starting node, which is set to 0. Create a priority queue to hold the nodes to be processed, starting with node 12.\n\n2. **Processing Nodes**: Extract the node with the smallest known distance from the priority queue (node 12). For this node, update the distances to its neighbors (nodes 7 and 15). Since node 12 connects directly to node 7 and node 15, update their distances accordingly.\n\n3. **Repeat Until Destination Reached**: Continue extracting nodes from the priority queue and updating the distances to their neighbors until the destination node (node 1) is reached. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n\nLet's go through the steps manually for simplicity:\n- From node 12, we can go to nodes 7 and 15.\n- From node 7, we can go to nodes 12, 23, and 15. Node 15 is already visited, so we skip it. We update the distance to node 23.\n- From node 15, we can go to nodes 14, 16, 18, and 7. Node 7 is already visited, so we skip it. We update the distance to nodes 14, 16, and 18.\n- From node 16, we can go to node 19. Update the distance to node 19.\n- From node 18, we can go to nodes 15, 17, and 21. Node 15 is already visited, so we skip it. Update the distance to nodes 17 and 21.\n- From node 21, we can go to node 9. Update the distance to node 9.\n- From node 17, we can go to node 18. Node 18 is already visited, so we skip it.\n- From node 23, we can go to nodes 8 and 7. Node 7 is already visited, so we skip it. Update the distance to node 8.\n- From node 14, we can go to nodes 5 and 10. Update the distance to nodes 5 and 10.\n- From node 10, we can go to nodes 14 and 24. Node 14 is already visited, so we skip it. Update the distance to node 24.\n- From node 19, we can go to node 16. Node 16 is already visited, so we skip it.\n- From node 9, we can go to node 21. Node 21 is already visited, so we skip it.\n- From node 5, we can go to node 14. Node 14 is already visited, so we skip it.\n- From node 24, we can go to node 10. Node 10 is already visited, so we skip it.\n- From node 8, we can go to node 23. Node 23 is already visited, so we skip it.\n- From node 11, we can go to nodes 2, 3, and 1.
