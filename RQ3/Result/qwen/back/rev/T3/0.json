Since all the edges in the given graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a queue and add the starting node to it. Also, maintain a visited set to keep track of visited nodes and a path dictionary to record the path taken.\n2. **Processing**: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node. For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, mark it as visited, update its path, and enqueue it.\n3. **Termination**: When the target node is dequeued, the process stops. The recorded path from the start node to the target node gives the shortest path.\n\n### Applying BFS to the Given Graph:\n- **Start Node**: 2\n- **Target Node**: 1\n\nWe will trace the BFS steps:\n\n1.
