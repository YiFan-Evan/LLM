Here are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a distance dictionary where each node is set to infinity (representing unknown distances) except for the starting node, which is set to zero. Also, initialize a predecessor dictionary to keep track of the previous node in the shortest path.\n\n2. **Processing Nodes**: Process each node in order of increasing known distance from the starting node. For each node, update the distance to all its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n\n3. **Tracking Path**: Keep track of the shortest path by updating the predecessor dictionary whenever a shorter path is found.\n\n4. **Termination**: Continue until the destination node is reached or all reachable nodes have been processed.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n- **Nodes**: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n- **Edges**: [[0, 7], [0, 14], [1, 11], [1, 13], [1, 14], [2, 12], [2, 4], [3, 5], [3, 9], [3, 13], [4, 9], [6, 10], [8, 13], [10, 14]]\n- **Start Node**: 4\n- **Destination Node**: 12\n\nLet's perform Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1.
