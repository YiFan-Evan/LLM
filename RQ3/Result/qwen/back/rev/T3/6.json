Since all the edges in the given graph have the same weight, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex.\n\nHere are the steps for using BFS:\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. Move to the next unvisited neighbor and repeat the process until you reach the target node.\n4.

Initialize the queue and mark the start node (1) as visited.\n2. Add all the neighbors of the start node (1) to the queue.\n3.
