However, since the provided graph does not specify any edge weights, we'll assume all edges have equal weight (i.e., they are all 1). We can still apply Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm or even simpler, Breadth-First Search (BFS), given this assumption.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start from the source node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Then explore all the neighbors of those neighbors.\n4. Continue this process until you reach the destination node.\n5. Track the path taken to reach the destination.\n\nLet's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Mark node 6 as visited.\n   - Enqueue node 6.\n   \n2. **Explore neighbors**:\n   - Node 6 has neighbors: 8 and 11.\n   - Mark and enqueue both nodes 8 and 11.\n\n3. **Explore further**:\n   - For node 8, its neighbors are: 2, 7, and 12.\n     - Nodes 2 and 7 are not part of our target path yet.\n     - Node 12 is not directly relevant.\n   - For node 11, its neighbors are: 4, 5, and 6 (already visited).\n     - None of these lead directly to the target node 10.\n\n4. **Continue exploring**:\n   - From node 8, we move to node 2.\n   - Node 2 has neighbors: 8 (already visited), but none of them lead directly to the target node 10.\n   - Move to node 7.\n   - Node 7 has neighbors: 1, 8 (already visited), and 7 (already visited).\n     - None of these lead directly to the target node 10.\n\n5. **Move to another neighbor of node 6**:\n   - From node 6, we also explore node 11.\n   - Node 11 has neighbors: 4, 5, and 6 (already visited).\n     - None of these lead directly to the target node 10.\n\n6. **Continue searching**:\n   - We need to look at the connections of other nodes.\n   - Node 0 connects to 6 and 10 directly.\n     - Since node 10 is directly connected to node 0 and node 6 connects to node 0, the shortest path is through node 0.\n\nSo, the path is:\n6 -> 0 -> 10\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\n6->0->10"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 6], [1, 7], [2, 8], [3, 12], [4, 9], [4, 11], [5, 11], [6, 11], [6, 8], [7, 8], [8, 12]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 6 to node 0, we can again use either Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm or BFS.
