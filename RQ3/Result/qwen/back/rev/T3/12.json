However, since the graph provided is relatively small and simple, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is simpler and sufficient for unweighted graphs like the one given.\n\nHere are the steps we follow using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start from the node 6. Mark this node as visited and add it to a queue.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node (0). If yes, reconstruct the path. If not, enqueue all its neighbors that have not been visited yet.\n3. **Repeat**: Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target node is found, trace back the path by following the parent pointers.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to our specific graph:\n\n- **Start Node**: 6\n- **Target Node**: 0\n\nWe'll perform BFS starting from node 6:\n\n1.
