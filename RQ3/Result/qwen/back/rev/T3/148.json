This algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to be visited, starting with the start node. It iterates through the graph, visiting the nearest unvisited node first and updating the distances to its neighbors. The algorithm stops when it reaches the destination node or has visited all reachable nodes.\n\nIn this case, we are given the graph as a set of nodes and edges, a start node (2), and a destination node (8). Let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize the distance to the start node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\n2. Create a priority queue and insert all nodes into it, prioritized by their current distance from the start node.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Extract the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\n   - For each neighbor of this node:\n     - Calculate the tentative distance from the start node to the neighbor through the current node.\n     - If this tentative distance is smaller than the current known distance to the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and record the current node as the predecessor of the neighbor.\n4. Stop when the destination node is extracted from the queue or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n- Start at node 2.\n- From node 2, we can reach node 4 directly.\n- From node 4, we can reach node 5 directly.\n- From node 5, we can reach node 14 directly.\n- From node 14, we can reach node 9 directly.\n- From node 9, we can reach node 10 directly, which is our destination node 8.\n\nFollowing the path backwards, we get: 2->4->5->14->9->10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->4->5->14->9->10. \n\nHowever, since node 10 is directly connected to node 8, we can simplify the path to: 2->4->5->14->9->8. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->4->5->14->9->8."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 7], [3, 12], [4, 5], [5, 14], [6, 10], [8, 10], [9, 10], [9, 11], [9, 14], [11, 13], [12, 13]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm.
