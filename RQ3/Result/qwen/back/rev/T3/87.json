Since the given graph does not specify any weights on the edges, we assume all edges have equal weight.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize**: Start at the source node (10). Mark all other nodes as unvisited.\n2. **Distance Tracking**: Use a dictionary to keep track of the shortest distance from the start node to each node. Initially, set the distance to the start node as 0 and infinity (\u221e) for all other nodes.\n3. **Path Tracking**: Maintain a dictionary to record the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **BFS Traversal**: Use a queue to explore nodes level by level. For each node, update the distances and paths of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n5. **Termination**: Stop when the destination node (11) is reached or all reachable nodes are processed.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n\n- **Initial State**:\n  - Distance to node 10: 0\n  - Distance to all other nodes: \u221e\n\n- **Step-by-step BFS**:\n  - Start at node 10.\n  - From node 10, we can go to node 0 and node 2.\n    - Distance to node 0: 1\n    - Distance to node 2: 1\n    - Path to node 0: 10->0\n    - Path to node 2: 10->2\n\n  - Next, explore nodes at distance 1:\n    - Node 2 can go to nodes 3, 10, and 11.\n      - Distance to node 3: 2 (via 2)\n      - Distance to node 11: 2 (via 2)\n      - Path to node 3: 10->2->3\n      - Path to node 11: 10->2->11\n\n    - Node 0 has no further neighbors.\n\n  - Explore nodes at distance 2:\n    - Node 11 is our destination.
