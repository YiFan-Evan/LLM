Given that all the edges in the graph have equal weight (no weights are provided), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a queue and adding the starting node to it. Also, initialize a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path later.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node and check if it\u2019s the target node. If not, enqueue all its neighbors that haven\u2019t been visited yet.\n3. **Track Parents**: Keep track of the parent of each node to help reconstruct the path once the target is reached.\n4. **Reconstruct Path**: Once the target node is reached, trace back from the target node to the start node using the parent information.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n#### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n- **Queue Initialization**: Queue = [6]\n- **Parent Initialization**: Parent = {6: None}\n\n**Iteration 1:**\n- Dequeue 6.\n- Neighbors of 6: [4]\n- Add neighbor 4 to the queue and set its parent to 6.\n- Queue = [4]\n- Parent = {6: None, 4: 6}\n\n**Iteration 2:**\n- Dequeue 4.\n- Neighbors of 4: [0, 1, 2, 5, 7]\n- Add neighbors 0, 1, 2, 5, 7 to the queue and set their parents to 4.\n- Queue = [0, 1, 2, 5, 7]\n- Parent = {6: None, 4: 6, 0: 4, 1: 4, 2: 4, 5: 4, 7: 4}\n\n**Iteration 3:**\n- Dequeue 0.\n- Neighbors of 0: [3]\n- Add neighbor 3 to the queue and set its parent to 0.\n- Queue = [1, 2, 5, 7, 3]\n- Parent = {6: None, 4: 6, 0: 4, 1: 4, 2: 4, 5: 4, 7: 4, 3: 0}\n\n**Iteration 4:**\n- Dequeue 1.\n- Neighbors of 1: [6] (already visited)\n- No new nodes added.\n- Queue = [2, 5, 7, 3]\n\n**Iteration 5:**\n- Dequeue 2.\n- Neighbors of 2: [4] (already visited)\n- No new nodes added.\n- Queue = [5, 7, 3]\n\n**Iteration 6:**\n- Dequeue 5.\n- Neighbors of 5: [4] (already visited)\n- No new nodes added.\n- Queue = [7, 3]\n\n**Iteration 7:**\n- Dequeue 7.\n- Neighbors of 7: [4] (already visited)\n- No new nodes added.\n- Queue = [3]\n\n**Iteration 8:**\n- Dequeue 3.\n- Neighbors of 3: []\n- Target node 3 is found.\n- Reconstruct path using parents: \n  - 3 -> 0 -> 4 -> 6\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->4->0->3"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 6], [1, 4], [2, 4], [4, 5], [4, 7]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
