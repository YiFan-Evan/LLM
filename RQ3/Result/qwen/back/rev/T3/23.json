In this case, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting point.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore its adjacent nodes.\n3. Add those nodes to a queue and mark them as visited.\n4. Remove the current node from the queue and move to the next unvisited node.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 6.\n\n### BFS Steps:\n1. Start at node 3.\n2. Explore its adjacent nodes: node 5.\n3. Add node 5 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n4. Move to node 5.\n5. Explore its adjacent nodes: node 6.\n6. Add node 6 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n7.

BFS is well-suited for this task because it explores all the vertices level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path.\n\n### BFS Steps:\n1. **Initialize**: Start at node 3. Mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Explore**:\n   - Dequeue node 3. Its neighbors are node 5 and node 2.\n   - Enqueue node 5 and mark it as visited.\n   - Enqueue node 2 and mark it as visited.\n3. **Continue exploring**:\n   - Dequeue node 5. It is the destination node, so stop here.\n   - Node 5 has no further neighbors to explore.\n\nSince node 5 was reached directly from node 3, the shortest path is simply the direct connection between them.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->5"}]
