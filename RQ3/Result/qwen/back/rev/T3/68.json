However, since the graph provided does not have any weights on its edges, we can consider all edges to have equal weight (i.e., weight = 1). Dijkstra's algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to be visited, starting with the initial node. It iteratively selects the node with the smallest tentative distance, marks it as visited, and updates the distances of its unvisited neighbors.\n\nHere are the steps for Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm applied to this specific graph:\n\n1. Initialize the distances to all nodes as infinity, except for the starting node (node 0), whose distance is set to 0.\n2. Set the starting node (node 0) as the current node.\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the tentative distance through the current node. If this distance is less than the previously recorded distance for the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance.\n4. Move to the next unvisited node with the smallest known distance from the starting node.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the target node (node 3) is selected as the current node or there are no more nodes to visit.\n\nLet's apply these steps to our graph:\n\n1.
