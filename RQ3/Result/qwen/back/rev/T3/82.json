Since all edges in the provided graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start from the source node.\n2. Visit all the neighbors of the source node.\n3. Then visit all the neighbors of those nodes, and so on.\n4. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n5.
