However, since the graph here is relatively small and simple, we can also manually trace the paths from the start node to the destination.\n\nGiven the graph, we need to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 13. Let's analyze the connections step by step:\n\n1. Node 3 is directly connected to node 6.\n2. Node 6 is connected to nodes 12 and 14.\n3.
