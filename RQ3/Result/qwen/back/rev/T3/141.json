Since all the edges in the provided graph have equal weight, BFS is sufficient and efficient for finding the shortest path.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize BFS**: Start from the source node (node 3).\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: For each node, explore its neighbors level by level.\n3. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Stop Condition**: Stop when the target node (node 9) is reached.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n1. **Initialize BFS Queue and Visited Set**:\n   - Queue: Add the start node (3).\n   - Visited: Mark the start node as visited.\n\n2. **While Loop**:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - Check if it\u2019s the target node (9).\n   - If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.\n\n3. **Track Path**:\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent node for each node visited.\n   - Use this dictionary to reconstruct the path once the target node is reached.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n- Start at node 3.\n- Node 3 has neighbor node 2. Add node 2 to the queue.\n- Node 2 has neighbors nodes 3, 6, and 14. Add nodes 6 and 14 to the queue (skip node 3 since it is already visited).\n- Continue this process until we reach node 9.\n\n### Reconstructing the Path:\n- Once node 9 is reached, trace back using the parent dictionary.\n\n### Final Path Reconstruction:\nBy applying BFS, we can determine the shortest path from node 3 to node 9.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->2->6->14->9"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 8], [0, 12], [1, 7], [2, 3], [2, 6], [2, 14], [4, 10], [4, 6], [5, 12], [6, 11], [6, 7], [7, 12], [8, 13], [9, 13]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 14"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 3 to node 14 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
