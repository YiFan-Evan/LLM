In this case, since all edges are unweighted (i.e., they have the same cost), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start from the source node and mark it as visited.\n2. Enqueue the source node.\n3. Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node. If yes, stop and return the path.\n4. Otherwise, enqueue all its neighboring nodes that haven\u2019t been visited yet and mark them as visited.\n5.

Dequeue node 4 and check its neighbors: nodes 0 and 7. Mark them as visited and enqueue them.\n4. Dequeue node 0 and check its neighbors: node 4 (already visited). No new nodes to enqueue.\n5. Dequeue node 7 and check its neighbors: nodes 1, 2, and 4 (already visited). Mark nodes 1 and 2 as visited and enqueue them.\n6. Dequeue node 1 and check its neighbors: node 6. Mark node 6 as visited and enqueue it.\n7. Dequeue node 6 and check its neighbors: node 7 (already visited). No new nodes to enqueue.\n8. Dequeue node 2 and check its neighbors: node 3.
