Since the given graph doesn't have weights on its edges, BFS is a simpler and more efficient method.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node (node 11).\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. Mark the current node as visited.\n4. Move to the next level of nodes (neighbors of neighbors).\n5. Repeat until the target node (node 12) is found.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 11.\n2. From node 11, the neighbors are node 10 and node 14.\n3. Move to node 10 (since we are looking for the shortest path to node 12, we don't visit node 14 right now).\n4. From node 10, there are no direct paths to node 12.\n5. Move back to node 11 and explore node 14.\n6. From node 14, the neighbors are node 2, node 0, and node 11 (already visited). We then move to node 2.\n7. From node 2, the neighbors are node 6. We then move to node 6.\n8. From node 6, the neighbors are node 5. Node 5 does not lead directly to the target node.\n9. Go back to node 2 and then to node 14 again.\n10. From node 14, we find that node 0 is a neighbor. Node 0 has a neighbor node 3.\n11. From node 3, there are no direct paths to node 12.\n12. Finally, from node 0, the neighbor node 3 connects to node 1, and node 1 connects to node 8.\n13. Node 8 does not connect directly to node 12.\n14. From node 1, the neighbor node 4 connects to node 12.\n\nThus, the path from node 11 to node 12 is: 11 -> 14 -> 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 12.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 11->14->0->1->4->12."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 1], [0, 14], [1, 8], [1, 4], [2, 6], [2, 14], [4, 12], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 13], [10, 11], [11, 14], [13, 14]]} The start node: 11 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
