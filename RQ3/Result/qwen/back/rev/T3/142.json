BFS is particularly useful for this task because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, thereby ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. Start by adding the initial node to a queue.\n2. Mark the initial node as visited to avoid processing the same node multiple times.\n3. Process nodes in the queue one by one:\n   - For each node, check if it is the destination. If so, the search is complete.\n   - Otherwise, add all unvisited neighbors of the current node to the queue and mark them as visited.\n4. Continue until the queue is empty or the destination is found.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 13 in the given graph.\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [3]\n   - Visited nodes: {3}\n\n2. **Process Node 3**:\n   - Neighbors of 3: [0]\n   - Add neighbor 0 to the queue: Queue = [0]\n   - Mark 0 as visited: Visited = {3, 0}\n\n3. **Process Node 0**:\n   - Neighbors of 0: [3, 12, 4]\n   - Add unvisited neighbors 12 and 4 to the queue: Queue = [12, 4]\n   - Mark 12 and 4 as visited: Visited = {3, 0, 12, 4}\n\n4. **Process Node 12**:\n   - Neighbors of 12: [0, 13]\n   - Add unvisited neighbor 13 to the queue: Queue = [4, 13]\n   - Mark 13 as visited: Visited = {3, 0, 12, 4, 13}\n\n5. **Process Node 4**:\n   - Neighbors of 4: [0, 2, 14]\n   - No new unvisited neighbors, so skip.\n\n6. **Process Node 13**:\n   - Destination node found.\n\nSince the destination node 13 is found when processing node 12, the shortest path is traced back through the visited nodes.\n\n### Trace Back Path:\n- From 13 to 12 to 0 to 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->0->12->13"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 12], [0, 4], [1, 9], [2, 8], [2, 4], [2, 14], [5, 10], [5, 13], [6, 7], [7, 9], [7, 14], [9, 11], [12, 13]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 12"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node in a graph, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
