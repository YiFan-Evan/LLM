However, given the small size of the graph, we can also solve this using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach since all edges have the same weight.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start from the source node (0). Mark it as visited and add it to a queue.\n2. **Processing**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node (7). If yes, stop and reconstruct the path.\n3. **Exploration**: For each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n4. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. Start at node 0.\n2. Visit its neighbors: nodes 3 and 4.\n3. From node 3, visit its neighbors: nodes 5 and 8.\n4. From node 8, visit its neighbor: node 10.\n5. From node 4, visit its neighbor: node 12.\n6. From node 12, visit its neighbor: node 6.\n7. From node 6, visit its neighbor: node 11.\n8. From node 11, visit its neighbor: node 7 (target node).\n\nBy following the above steps, we can trace back the path from the target node 7 to the start node 0.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- Node 7 is reached from node 11.\n- Node 11 is reached from node 6.\n- Node 6 is reached from node 12.\n- Node 12 is reached from node 4.\n- Node 4 is reached from node 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->4->12->6->11->7"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 7], [2, 11], [3, 5], [3, 8], [4, 12], [5, 9], [6, 11], [6, 12], [8, 10]]} The start node: 0 The destination: 11"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 0 to node 11, we can again use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach due to the uniform edge weights in the graph.
