BFS is particularly suitable for this task because it explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, ensuring that the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) is found before any longer paths.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. Start at the initial node (the start node).\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n4. Use a queue to manage which node to visit next. Enqueue the start node initially.\n5. For each node dequeued, check if it is the target node. If so, reconstruct the path.\n6. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the current node.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given graph, starting node 2, and target node 3.\n\n- Start at node 2.\n- Node 2 has one neighbor, node 4.\n- From node 4, we can see that there are no direct paths to node 3. So, continue exploring other possibilities.\n- Node 4 has one neighbor, node 7.\n- Node 7 has a connection to node 0, but no direct connection to node 3.\n- We need to trace back and explore other paths. Starting from node 2 again:\n  - Node 2 connects to node 4, which connects to node 7, and node 7 connects back to node 0.\n  - Node 0 connects directly to node 3.\n\nBy following these steps, the shortest path from node 2 to node 3 is via node 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->4->7->0->3"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 4], [4, 7], [5, 7]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
