One of the most common and efficient algorithms for this purpose is Dijkstra's algorithm. However, since the graph provided is relatively small and simple, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS), which is simpler and equally effective for unweighted graphs like this one.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes of the current node before moving on to the next level of nodes.\n3. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4.
