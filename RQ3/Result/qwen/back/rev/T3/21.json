In this case, since the graph does not have weighted edges, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start by adding the initial node to the queue.\n2. Mark the initial node as visited.\n3. Process each node in the queue by visiting all its unvisited neighbors and adding them to the queue.\n4. Continue until the queue is empty or the target node has been visited.\n5. To reconstruct the path, keep track of the parent node for each node during the traversal.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 6.\n\n### Step-by-step BFS Traversal:\n\n1. Initialize the queue with the start node (2).\n2. Mark node 2 as visited and set its parent to None.\n3. Dequeue node 2 and explore its neighbors (5 and 7):\n   - Enqueue node 5 (parent = 2).\n   - Enqueue node 7 (parent = 2).\n4. Dequeue node 5 and explore its neighbors (6):\n   - Enqueue node 6 (parent = 5).\n5. Dequeue node 7 and explore its neighbors (already visited).\n6. Dequeue node 6 and mark it as visited.\n\nSince node 6 is now visited, we stop the BFS traversal.\n\n### Reconstructing the Path:\n- Node 6 has parent 5.\n- Node 5 has parent 2.\n- Therefore, the path from 2 to 6 is: 2 -> 5 -> 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->5->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 3], [2, 5], [2, 7], [3, 6], [4, 7], [5, 6]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path in a graph from a start node to a target node, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
