Since the given graph does not have weighted edges (all edges are considered to have equal weight), BFS is sufficient for finding the shortest path.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Continue until you reach the target node.\n4.
