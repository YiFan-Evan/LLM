In this specific case, since all the edges can be considered to have equal weight (no edge weights are provided), we can use BFS which is simpler and more efficient for unweighted graphs.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Move to the next level of nodes (neighbors of the neighbors).\n4. Continue until you reach the target node.\n5.
