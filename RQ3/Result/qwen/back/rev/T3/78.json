In this case, since the edges are unweighted, BFS is more appropriate because it explores all the vertices of a given distance from the source before moving on to vertices at the next distance level.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. Move to the next level of nodes (i.e., nodes that are one edge further away).\n4. Continue until you reach the target node.\n5.
