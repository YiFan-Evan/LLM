Here are the key principles:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Assign a tentative distance value to every node. Set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. Mark all nodes as unvisited.\n\n2. **Select Current Node**: Set the initial node as the current node. For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n\n3. **Mark Visited**: When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\n\n4. **Choose Next Node**: Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node\", and go back to step 2.\n\nWe continue this process until we reach the destination node or until there are no nodes left to visit.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph with the start node 2 and the destination node 20:\n\n- Start at node 2.\n- From node 2, the only neighbor is node 10.\n- From node 10, we can go to node 7.\n- From node 7, we can go to node 9.\n- From node 9, we can directly go to node 20.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 2 to node 20 is:\n2->10->7->9->20\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->10->7->9->20"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 10], [3, 16], [3, 18], [3, 24], [4, 19], [5, 8], [5, 15], [5, 18], [6, 24], [7, 10], [7, 9], [9, 20], [9, 13], [9, 23], [11, 17], [11, 12], [12, 15], [13, 19], [14, 22], [17, 21], [19, 22], [21, 23]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Assign a tentative distance value to every node.
