In this scenario, since all edges have the same weight (implied by the context), BFS is sufficient and more straightforward.\n\nHere are the fundamental principles of BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by marking the start node as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Processing Nodes**: Dequeue a node, check if it is the target node. If yes, stop and return the path. Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target node is found, trace back through the parent pointers to construct the shortest path.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n**Graph Representation:**\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nEdges: [[0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 7], [6, 7]]\n\n**Start Node:** 6  \n**Destination Node:** 4\n\n**Step-by-step BFS Execution:**\n\n1.
