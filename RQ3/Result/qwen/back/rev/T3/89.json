However, since our graph is unweighted (all edges have equal weight), we can simplify the process using a breadth-first search (BFS). BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. Start at the given starting node (6).\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. Mark the explored nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n4.
