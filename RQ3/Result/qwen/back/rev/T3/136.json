Since the problem doesn't specify whether the graph is weighted or unweighted, and the edges don't have weights, we'll assume the graph is unweighted and use BFS.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS explores all the vertices of a graph level by level. It starts at the source node and explores all its neighbors before moving to the next level of nodes.\n2. **Queue**: BFS uses a queue to keep track of nodes to be explored. The algorithm starts with the source node and adds its neighbors to the queue. Nodes are processed in the order they were added to the queue.\n3. **Parent Tracking**: To reconstruct the shortest path, we need to track the parent of each node during the BFS traversal. This helps us trace back from the destination node to the source node.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (6) to it.\n2. Use a dictionary to track the parent of each node.\n3. Process nodes level by level until the destination node (12) is found.\n4. Once the destination node is found, trace back using the parent information to construct the shortest path.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph_nodes, graph_edges, start_node, end_node):\n    # Create adjacency list\n    adj_list = defaultdict(list)\n    for edge in graph_edges:\n        u, v = edge\n        adj_list[u].append(v)\n        adj_list[v].append(u)\n\n    # Initialize queue and parent tracking\n    queue = deque([start_node])\n    parents = {node: None for node in graph_nodes}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == end_node:\n            break\n        \n        for neighbor in adj_list[current_node]:\n            if parents[neighbor] is None:\n                parents[neighbor] = current_node\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # Reconstruct path\n    path = []\n    step = end_node\n    while step is not None:\n        path.append(step)\n        step = parents[step]\n    \n    return \"->\".join(map(str, path[::-1]))\n\n# Graph data\ngraph_nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\ngraph_edges = [[0, 12], [1, 8], [1, 13], [2, 13], [2, 12], [3, 10], [3, 13], [4, 9], [5, 12], [5, 6], [6, 7], [6, 14], [8, 9], [9, 11]]\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 6\nend_node = 12\n\n# Find shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph_nodes, graph_edges, start_node, end_node)\n```\n\n### Result:\nAfter running the BFS algorithm, the shortest path from node 6 to node 12 is reconstructed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->5->12"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 12], [1, 8], [1, 13], [2, 13], [2, 12], [3, 10], [3, 13], [4, 9], [5, 12], [5, 6], [6, 7], [6, 14], [8, 9], [9, 11]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 6 to node 5 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
