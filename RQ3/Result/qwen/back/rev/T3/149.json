BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path from the starting node.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start at the source node. Create a queue and add the source node to it. Mark the source node as visited.\n2. **Traversal**: Dequeue a node and examine it. If this node is the destination node, stop the search and return the path. Otherwise, enqueue all its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet.\n3. **Repeat**: Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty or the destination node is found.\n\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 2 and the destination node 5.\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n1. **Start at node 2**.\n2. Enqueue node 2.\n3. Dequeue node 2, explore its neighbors (node 6 and node 13).\n4. Enqueue node 6 and node 13.\n5. Dequeue node 6, explore its neighbors (node 13).\n6. Node 13 is already enqueued, so skip it.\n7. Dequeue node 13, explore its neighbors (node 5, node 7, node 8).\n8. Enqueue node 5, node 7, and node 8.\n9. Dequeue node 5, which is our destination node.\n\nSince we have reached the destination node 5, we now trace back the path using the parent pointers (or reconstruct the path based on the order of traversal).\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- Node 5 was reached from node 13.\n- Node 13 was reached from node 2.\n\nSo the path is: 2 -> 13 -> 5.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->13->5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 13], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 10], [4, 9], [5, 13], [6, 13], [7, 12], [7, 13], [8, 11], [8, 13], [8, 14]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 13"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 2 to node 13 in the given graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS), we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Start at node 2.\n   - Create a queue and add node 2 to it.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to track the parent node for each node encountered during the search.\n\n2. **Traversal**:\n   - Dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\n   - Enqueue any neighbor that has not been visited yet and record its parent.\n   - Continue until the destination node (13) is dequeued.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Once the destination node is found, trace back from the destination node to the start node using the parent pointers.\n\nLet's go through the BFS process step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Start at node 2**.\n2.
