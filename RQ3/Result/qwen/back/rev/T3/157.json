In this case, since the graph does not have weights assigned to its edges, BFS is a straightforward choice.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Use a queue to keep track of the next nodes to explore.\n4.
