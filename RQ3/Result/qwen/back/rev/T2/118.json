However, since the given graph is unweighted (all edges have the same weight), we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is simpler and more efficient for this case.\n\nBreadth-First Search works by exploring all the neighbors of a node before moving on to their neighbors. This ensures that the shortest path to any node is found first because BFS explores nodes level by level, where each level represents one step away from the starting node.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS would be applied to solve this problem:\n\n1.
