In this case, since the graph does not specify any weights on the edges, we can assume all edges have equal weight.\n\nHere, BFS is a straightforward method to find the shortest path because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest possible path.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 10.\n2. Explore its neighbors (if any).\n3. Continue exploring until we reach node 1.\n\nLet's trace the BFS steps:\n\n1. Start at node 10.\n2. Node 10 has one neighbor: node 8.\n3.
