This algorithm is particularly useful for graphs with non-negative weights on the edges. However, in the case where all edges have equal weight (or no weights are specified, which is the case here), we can simplify our approach by using Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is ideal for this situation because it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring that the shortest path is found.\n\nHere\u2019s how we would apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 6:\n\n1. Start at node 4.\n2. Explore all neighbors of node 4 (nodes directly connected to it).\n3. From those neighbors, explore their neighbors, and so on, until reaching node 6.\n4.

From node 4, move to one of its neighbors (let's choose node 0):\n   - Neighbors of node 0 are nodes 3 and 4 (node 4 is already visited).\n\n3. Move to another neighbor of node 4, which is node 2:\n   - Neighbors of node 2 are nodes 5 and 4 (node 4 is already visited).\n\n4.
