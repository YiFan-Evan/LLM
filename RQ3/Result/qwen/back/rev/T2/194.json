Mark it as visited and add it to a queue.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Dequeue the current node, and for each of its neighbors that have not been visited yet, mark them as visited and enqueue them.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue this process until the target node (node 11) is dequeued.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n1. **Start at node 17**:\n   - Neighbors of 17: [14, 23]\n   - Enqueue 14 and 23.\n\n2. **Dequeue node 14**:\n   - Neighbors of 14: [5, 21]\n   - Enqueue 5 and 21.\n\n3. **Dequeue node 23**:\n   - Neighbors of 23: [1, 6, 17, 19]\n   - Node 17 is already visited, so do not enqueue it again.\n   - Enqueue 1, 6, and 19.\n\n4. **Dequeue node 5**:\n   - Neighbors of 5: [3, 14]\n   - Node 14 is already visited, so do not enqueue it again.\n   - Enqueue 3.\n\n5. **Dequeue node 21**:\n   - Node 21 has no new neighbors to enqueue.\n\n6. **Dequeue node 1**:\n   - Neighbors of 1: [23]\n   - Node 23 is already visited, so do not enqueue it again.\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n\n7. **Dequeue node 6**:\n   - Neighbors of 6: [7, 8, 23]\n   - Nodes 23 and 7 are already visited, so do not enqueue them again.\n   - Enqueue 8.\n\n8. **Dequeue node 19**:\n   - Neighbors of 19: [23]\n   - Node 23 is already visited, so do not enqueue it again.\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n\n9. **Dequeue node 3**:\n   - Neighbors of 3: [5]\n   - Node 5 is already visited, so do not enqueue it again.\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n\n10. **Dequeue node 8**:\n    - Neighbors of 8: [10]\n    - Enqueue 10.\n\n11. **Dequeue node 10**:\n    - Neighbors of 10: [12, 15]\n    - Enqueue 12 and 15.\n\n12. **Dequeue node 12**:\n    - Neighbors of 12: None\n    - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n\n13. **Dequeue node 15**:\n    - Neighbors of 15: [10, 4]\n    - Node 10 is already visited, so do not enqueue it again.\n    - Enqueue 4.\n\n14. **Dequeue node 4**:\n    - Neighbors of 4: [15]\n    - Node 15 is already visited, so do not enqueue it again.\n    - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n\n15. **Dequeue node 13**:\n    - Neighbors of 13: [9, 16, 24]\n    - Enqueue 9, 16, and 24.\n\n16. **Dequeue node 24**:\n    - Neighbors of 24: [11, 13]\n    - Node 13 is already visited, so do not enqueue it again.\n    - Enqueue 11.\n\nAt this point, node 11 is dequeued, and we have found the shortest path.\n\n### Shortest Path:\nThe shortest path from node 17 to node 11 is: 17 -> 23 -> 13 -> 24 -> 11.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 17->23->13->24->11."}]
