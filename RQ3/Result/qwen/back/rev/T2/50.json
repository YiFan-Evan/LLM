In this case, since the graph does not have weights on its edges, BFS is a straightforward choice.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes of the current node before moving to the next level of nodes.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n4. Stop when you reach the target node.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n### Step-by-step Execution of BFS\n\n1. **Start at Node 1**.\n    - Neighbors of Node 1 are Node 0 and Node 7.\n\n2. **Explore Node 0**:\n    - Neighbors of Node 0 are Node 2 and Node 1 (already visited).\n\n3. **Explore Node 7**:\n    - Neighbors of Node 7 are Node 1 (already visited) and Node 3.\n\n4. **Explore Node 3**:\n    - Neighbors of Node 3 are Node 4 and Node 7 (already visited).\n\n5. **Explore Node 2**:\n    - Neighbors of Node 2 are Node 0 (already visited) and Node 5.\n\n6. **Explore Node 4**:\n    - Neighbors of Node 4 are Node 3 (already visited).\n\n7. **Explore Node 5**:\n    - Neighbors of Node 5 are Node 6 and Node 2 (already visited).\n\n8. **Explore Node 6**:\n    - Node 6 is our target node.\n\n### Path Reconstruction\nWe now trace back from Node 6 to Node 1 using the path recorded during BFS:\n- Node 6 -> Node 5 -> Node 2 -> Node 0 -> Node 1.\n\nHowever, we need to directly connect the start node to the target node:\n- From Node 1 to Node 7, then from Node 7 to Node 6.\n\nThus, the shortest path from Node 1 to Node 6 is:\n1->7->6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->7->6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 7], [5, 6], [6, 7]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 6 to node 1 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
