This algorithm works well for graphs with non-negative edge weights. It systematically explores the neighboring nodes, always choosing the next node to be the one closest to the starting node.\n\nHere are the steps involved in Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every node: set it to zero for the initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\n2. Set the initial node as current. Mark all other nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n4. When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node\", and go back to step 3.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n- Edges: [[0, 1], [1, 13], [2, 5], [2, 12], [2, 8], [3, 9], [4, 6], [4, 13], [6, 10], [7, 11], [7, 9], [8, 13], [9, 10], [13, 14]]\n- Start node: 7\n- Destination node: 8\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can trace the shortest path from node 7 to node 8:\n\n- From node 7, the direct connections are to nodes 11 and 9.\n- From node 9, the direct connections are to nodes 7, 10, and 3.\n- From node 10, the direct connections are to nodes 9 and 6.\n- From node 6, the direct connections are to nodes 4 and 10.\n- From node 4, the direct connections are to nodes 6 and 13.\n- From node 13, the direct connections are to nodes 0, 1, 4, 8, and 14.\n- From node 8, the direct connection is to node 13.\n\nFollowing the shortest path:\n- From node 7 to node 9\n- From node 9 to node 13\n- From node 13 to node 8\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->9->13->8"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 13], [2, 5], [2, 12], [2, 8], [3, 9], [4, 6], [4, 13], [6, 10], [7, 11], [7, 9], [8, 13], [9, 10], [13, 14]]} The start node: 8 The destination: 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 8 to node 7 in the given graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is designed to find the shortest paths from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.\n\nHere are the steps for Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Set the distance to the start node (node 8) as 0 and the distance to all other nodes as infinity.\n   - Create a set of unvisited nodes.\n\n2. **Select the current node**:\n   - Select the unvisited node with the smallest known distance from the start node (node 8).
