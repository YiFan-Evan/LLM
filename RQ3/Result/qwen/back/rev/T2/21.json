Since all edges in the given graph are unweighted, BFS is an appropriate choice because it explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start by initializing a queue and adding the starting node to it.\n2. Mark the starting node as visited and set its distance from itself to zero.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore all its neighbors.\n4. For each neighbor, if it hasn\u2019t been visited yet, mark it as visited, set its distance, and enqueue it.\n5. Keep track of the parent node for each node to reconstruct the path once the target node is reached.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n### Step-by-step BFS Execution:\n1. **Initialize**: \n   - Queue: [2]\n   - Visited: {2}\n   - Parent: {2: None}\n\n2. **Dequeue Node 2**:\n   - Neighbors of 2: [5, 7]\n   - Add 5 and 7 to the queue and mark them as visited.\n   - Update parent dictionary: {2: None, 5: 2, 7: 2}\n   - Queue: [5, 7]\n\n3. **Dequeue Node 5**:\n   - Neighbors of 5: [6]\n   - Add 6 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n   - Update parent dictionary: {2: None, 5: 2, 7: 2, 6: 5}\n   - Queue: [7, 6]\n\n4. **Dequeue Node 7**:\n   - Neighbors of 7: [0, 4]\n   - These nodes are already visited, so do nothing.\n   - Queue: [6]\n\n5. **Dequeue Node 6**:\n   - This is our target node, so stop here.\n\n### Reconstruct Path:\n- Starting from node 6, trace back using the parent dictionary:\n  - 6 -> 5 -> 2\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->5->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 3], [2, 5], [2, 7], [3, 6], [4, 7], [5, 6]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem of finding the shortest path from node 6 to node 2, we can again use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
