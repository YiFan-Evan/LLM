Since all edges in this graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can implement BFS:\n1. Start at the given start node.\n2. Use a queue to explore each node level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4.
