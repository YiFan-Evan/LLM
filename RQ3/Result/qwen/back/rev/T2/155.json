However, given the relatively small size of this graph, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS), which is simpler and works well for unweighted graphs like the one provided.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Use a queue to keep track of the next node to visit.\n4. Mark visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n5. Track the path taken to reach each node to reconstruct the shortest path once the target node is reached.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n- Start at node 0.\n- Visit its neighbors (13, 5).\n- From 13, visit its neighbors (3).\n- From 5, visit its neighbors (7).\n- From 3, visit its neighbors (12, 13).
