In this scenario, since all edges are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all vertices at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. Mark the explored nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n4. Continue the process until the target node is found.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 7 to node 6:\n\n1. Start at node 7.\n2. Explore its neighbors: node 20.\n3. From node 20, explore its neighbors: node 10 and node 7 (already visited).\n4. From node 10, explore its neighbors: node 20 (already visited), node 14.\n5. From node 14, explore its neighbors: node 15 and node 10 (already visited).\n6. From node 15, explore its neighbors: node 22 and node 23.\n7.

BFS is appropriate here because it systematically explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) is found first.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialize**: Start at node 6 and mark it as visited.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Visit all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Continue Exploration**: Move to the next level of nodes and repeat until the destination node (node 7) is reached.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n1. **Start at node 6**.\n   - Neighbors of node 6: nodes 11, 16, and 19.\n   \n2. **Explore neighbors of node 6**:\n   - For node 11: No further exploration needed.\n   - For node 16: No further exploration needed.\n   - For node 19: Neighbors of node 19 are nodes 1, 12, and 6 (already visited).\n\n3. **Explore neighbors of node 19**:\n   - For node 1: Neighbors are nodes 3, 13, and 19 (already visited).\n   - For node 12: Neighbors are nodes 8 and 19 (already visited).\n   - For node 6: Already visited.\n\n4. **Explore neighbors of node 1**:\n   - For node 3: No further exploration needed.\n   - For node 13: Neighbors are nodes 18 and 1 (already visited).\n   - For node 19: Already visited.\n\n5. **Explore neighbors of node 13**:\n   - For node 18: Neighbors are nodes 22 and 13 (already visited).\n   - For node 1: Already visited.\n\n6. **Explore neighbors of node 18**:\n   - For node 22: Neighbors are nodes 15 and 18 (already visited).\n   - For node 13: Already visited.\n\n7. **Explore neighbors of node 22**:\n   - For node 15: Neighbors are nodes 22 (already visited) and 23.\n   - For node 18: Already visited.\n\n8. **Explore neighbors of node 15**:\n   - For node 23: Neighbors are nodes 21, 15 (already visited), and 22 (already visited).\n   - For node 22: Already visited.\n\n9. **Explore neighbors of node 23**:\n   - For node 21: Neighbors are nodes 23 (already visited) and 24.\n   - For node 15: Already visited.\n\n10. **Explore neighbors of node 21**:\n    - For node 24: No further exploration needed.\n    - For node 23: Already visited.\n\n11. **Explore neighbors of node 7**:\n    - No neighbors directly connected to node 7 other than those already visited.\n\n12. **Trace Back the Path**:\n    - Node 7 is not directly reachable from the neighbors explored so far.
