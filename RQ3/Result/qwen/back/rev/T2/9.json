BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, which means it visits all the neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is via the shortest path from the start node.\n\nHere's how we apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 1:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Create a queue and add the start node (6) to it.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each node to reconstruct the path later.\n   - Mark the start node as visited.\n\n2. **Exploration**:\n   - Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node (1).\n   - If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited, while recording their parent node.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Once the target node (1) is dequeued, trace back from the target node to the start node using the parent pointers.\n\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n- Start node: 6\n- Target node: 1\n\nGraph:\n```\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nEdges: [[0, 6], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7]]\n```\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1.
