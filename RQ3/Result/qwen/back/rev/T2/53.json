Here, we'll outline the BFS approach:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start at the node 6.\n2. **Exploration**: Visit all the neighboring nodes of the current node and mark them as visited. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n3. **Iteration**: Move to the next level of nodes and repeat the process until we reach the target node (node 1).\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target node is reached, trace back the path from the target node to the start node.\n\nLet's apply these steps to our graph:\n\n- Starting at node 6, its neighbors are nodes 3 and 2.\n- From node 3, its neighbors are nodes 0 and 7.\n- From node 2, its neighbors are nodes 4 and 6 (but node 6 is already visited).\n- From node 1, its neighbors are nodes 5 and 6.\n\nBy tracing backwards from node 1 to the start node 6, we find the shortest path:\n\nNode 1 -> Node 6\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->1"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 6], [3, 7]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
