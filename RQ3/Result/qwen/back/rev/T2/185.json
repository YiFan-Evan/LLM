In this case, since all edges are unweighted (we assume they have the same cost or weight), BFS is an efficient choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can apply BFS to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start from node 8, mark it as visited, and add it to a queue.\n2. **Explore**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node (node 12). If yes, we stop and trace back the path. If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n4. **Trace Back**: Once the target node is found, trace back the path by checking the parent nodes stored during the search.\n\nLet's apply these steps to our specific problem:\n\n- Start at node 8.\n- From node 8, we can move to node 21.\n- From node 21, we can move to nodes 13, 14, and 22.\n- From node 13, we can move to node 22.\n- From node 14, we can move to node 21.\n- From node 22, we can move to node 13.\n- From node 13, we can move to node 12.\n\nNow tracing back from node 12, we get:\n- Node 12 is directly connected to node 13.\n- Node 13 is connected to node 22.\n- Node 22 is connected to node 21.\n- Node 21 is connected to node 8.\n\nThus, the path is 8 -> 21 -> 13 -> 12.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->21->13->12"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 16], [0, 24], [1, 3], [2, 10], [3, 19], [3, 12], [4, 7], [4, 20], [5, 6], [5, 13], [5, 21], [8, 21], [9, 15], [10, 20], [10, 16], [11, 17], [11, 14], [12, 15], [13, 22], [14, 21], [15, 16], [18, 21], [18, 20], [20, 23]]} The start node: 12 The destination: 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex. This ensures that when we reach the destination node, the path taken is the shortest one.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Create a queue and add the start node (12) to it.\n   - Mark the start node as visited.\n   - Store the parent of each node to trace back the path later.\n\n2. **Exploration**:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - Check if the dequeued node is the destination node (8).\n   - If yes, stop and trace back the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Trace back from the destination node using the parent information.\n\nLet's perform BFS starting from node 12 and trace the shortest path to node 8.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Initialize the queue with node 12.\n2. Enqueue neighbors of node 12 (which is node 15) and mark them as visited.\n3. Dequeue node 15 and enqueue its neighbors (node 16 and node 12 again, but skip node 12 since it's already visited).\n4. Dequeue node 16 and enqueue its neighbors (node 10 and node 15 again, but skip node 15 since it's already visited).\n5. Continue this process until we reach node 20 or node 8.\n6.
