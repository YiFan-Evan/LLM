This algorithm is designed to find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph, where the weights represent the distances or costs between nodes.\n\nHowever, for simplicity and since the given graph does not have weighted edges (all edges are considered equal), we can also use Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, meaning it visits all the neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This makes BFS ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the given start node (node 3).\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Visit all neighboring nodes of the current node.\n3. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Repeat**: Continue exploring until the target node (node 13) is reached.\n5. **Reconstruct Path**: Once the target node is found, reconstruct the path by backtracking through the tracked paths.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n- Start at node 3.\n- Node 3 has one neighbor: node 6.\n- From node 6, explore its neighbors: node 12 and node 14.\n- Neither of these neighbors lead directly to node 13, so continue.\n- From node 6, also explore its other neighbor: node 12.\n- Node 12 has neighbors: node 7 and node 14.\n- Node 7 has neighbors: node 0, node 9, and node 12.\n- Node 9 has neighbors: node 1 and node 7.\n- Node 1 has neighbors: node 8 and node 9.\n- Node 8 does not lead to

start and destination nodes, we will use BFS to find the shortest path from node 13 to node 3.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize**: Start from node 13.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Visit all neighboring nodes of the current node.\n3. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Repeat**: Continue exploring until the target node (node 3) is reached.\n5. **Reconstruct Path**: Once the target node is found, reconstruct the path by backtracking through the tracked paths.\n\nLet's apply BFS:\n\n- Start at node 13.\n- Node 13 has one neighbor: node 10.\n- From node 10, explore its neighbors: node 4.\n- From node 4, explore its neighbors: node 0.\n- From node 0, explore its neighbors: node 5, node 11, node 7.\n- From node 7, explore its neighbors: node 0, node 9, node 12.\n- From node 9, explore its neighbors: node 1, node 7.\n- From node 1, explore its neighbors: node 8, node 9.\n- From node 8, there are no new neighbors.\n- From node 9, explore its neighbors: node 1, node 7.\n- From node 7, explore its neighbors: node 0, node 9, node 12.\n- From node 12, explore its neighbors: node 6, node 7.\n- From node 6, explore its neighbors: node 3, node 14.\n- From node 3, explore its neighbors: node 6.\n\nNow, we see that node 3 is connected to node 6, which was previously visited via node 12, which was visited via node 7, which was visited via node 0, which was visited via node 4, which was visited via node 10, which was visited via node 13.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 13 to node 3 is:\n13 -> 10 -> 4 -> 0 -> 7 -> 12 -> 6 -> 3\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 13->10->4->0->7->12->6->3"}]
