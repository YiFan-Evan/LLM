Given that all edges in this graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere's a step-by-step outline of how BFS works:\n1. Start at the initial node and mark it as visited.\n2. Explore all its neighbors and add them to a queue.\n3.

BFS is appropriate here because it explores all the vertices of a graph level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is visited, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start at node 9. Mark node 9 as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Dequeue node 9. Its neighbors are nodes 10 and 12.\n   - Enqueue node 10.\n   - Enqueue node 12.\n3. **Next Level**: Dequeue node 10.
