One of the most commonly used algorithms for this purpose is Dijkstra's algorithm, which works well for graphs with non-negative edge weights. However, since our graph does not specify any edge weights and all edges are considered equal, we can also use a simpler Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is efficient for unweighted graphs.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the source node in a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Processing**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found the path. Otherwise, enqueue all its neighbors that have not been visited yet.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the target node is found, trace back through the visited nodes to reconstruct the path.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n### Graph Representation:\nNodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\nEdges: {{0, 4}, {1, 6}, {1, 7}, {2, 3}, {2, 7}, {4, 7}, {5, 7}}\n\n### Starting Point: Node 1\n### Target Point: Node 3\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1.
