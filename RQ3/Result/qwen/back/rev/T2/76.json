Since all edges in the provided graph are unweighted, BFS is more appropriate due to its simplicity and efficiency for such cases.\n\nHere are the steps involved in using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by marking the start node (node 2) as visited and add it to a queue.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node (node 3). If it is, stop and backtrack to reconstruct the path.\n3. **Expand Neighbors**: For each neighbor of the current node that hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n4. **Repeat**: Continue the process until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n\nLet's apply these steps to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3.\n\n### Step-by-step BFS Execution\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [2]\n   - Visited: {2}\n\n2. **Dequeue Node 2**:\n   - Neighbors of 2: [4] (since [2, 4] is an edge)\n   - Enqueue 4 and mark it as visited: {2, 4}\n   - Queue: [4]\n\n3. **Dequeue Node 4**:\n   - Neighbors of 4: [7] (since [4, 7] is an edge)\n   - Node 7 is not the target (3), so enqueue 7 and mark it as visited: {2, 4, 7}\n   - Queue: [7]\n\n4. **Dequeue Node 7**:\n   - Neighbors of 7: [0, 4] (since [0, 7] and [4, 7] are edges)\n   - Nodes 0 and 4 are already visited, so do nothing\n   - Queue: []\n\nSince node 3 was never encountered during the BFS traversal, there is no direct or indirect path from node 2 to node 3 in the given graph.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: No path exists.

BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is reached, it is via the shortest path from the starting node.\n\nHere\u2019s how we apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 2:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Start at node 3.\n   - Mark node 3 as visited and enqueue it.\n   - Initialize the queue with node 3.\n\n2. **Dequeue and Explore**:\n   - Dequeue node 3 and explore its neighbors.\n   - If any neighbor is the destination node (node 2), record the path and stop.\n   - Otherwise, mark the neighbors as visited and enqueue them.\n\n3. **Repeat**:\n   - Continue dequeuing and exploring neighbors until the destination node is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's go through the BFS step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [3]\n   - Visited: {3}\n\n2. **Dequeue Node 3**:\n   - Neighbors of 3: None (node 3 has no incoming edges, but we check outgoing edges for completeness)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue.\n\nSince node 3 does not have any outgoing edges, we need to reconsider the BFS approach considering all possible paths starting from node 3.\n\n### Corrected BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Reinitialize**:\n   - Start at node 3.\n   - Mark node 3 as visited and enqueue it.\n   - Initialize the queue with node 3.\n\n2. **Dequeue Node 3**:\n   - Neighbors of 3: None (since node 3 is not directly connected to any other nodes in the given edges)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue.\n\nSince node 3 does not have any outgoing edges, we need to look at the overall graph structure to find a path from node 3 to node 2. Let's trace back possible paths:\n\n- Node 3 is not directly connected to any other nodes.\n- We need to look at paths involving other nodes.\n\n### Re-evaluate the Graph Structure:\n\n- Node 0 connects to nodes 3, 6, and 7.\n- Node 6 and 7 do not connect directly to node 2.\n- Node 4 connects to node 7 and indirectly to node 2 via node 7.\n- Node 2 connects to node 4.\n\nGiven the structure, let's trace the path from node 3 to node 2 via intermediate nodes:\n\n- From node 3, there is no direct connection.\n- Check connections via other nodes:\n  - Node 0 connects to node 3, but node 0 does not connect to node 2 directly.\n  - Node 4 connects to node 7 and indirectly to node 2 via node 7.\n\nThus, the path involves tracing back from node 2 to node 4, and then potentially back to node 0.\n\nHowever, since node 3 is isolated and not part of the main connected component leading to node 2, there is no direct or indirect path from node 3 to node 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: No path exists."}]
