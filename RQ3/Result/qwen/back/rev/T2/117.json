Set it to zero for the starting node and to infinity for all other nodes.\n   - Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of the unvisited nodes.\n   \n2. **Select Current Node**:\n   - Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance value.

A visited node will not be revisited.\n   \n5. **Repeat Until Destination**:\n   - Repeat steps 2-4 until the destination node is marked as visited or no unvisited nodes remain.\n\n6. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Once the destination node is reached, trace back the shortest path using the recorded predecessor information.\n\n### Applying the Algorithm to the Given Graph:\n- **Nodes**: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\n- **Edges**: [[0, 4], [1, 4], [1, 9], [1, 8], [2, 10], [2, 7], [3, 6], [3, 10], [5, 11], [7, 12], [8, 11], [8, 12]]\n- **Start Node**: 8\n- **Destination Node**: 4\n\n#### Step-by-step Execution:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Tentative distances: `dist[8] = 0`, `dist[4] = \u221e` (initially).\n   - Unvisited nodes: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12}.\n   \n2. **Visit Node 8**:\n   - Update neighbors (nodes 1, 11, 12).\n   - Distances: `dist[1] = 1`, `dist[11] = 1`, `dist[12] = 1`.\n   \n3. **Visit Node 1**:\n   - Update neighbors (nodes 4, 8, 9).\n   - Distances: `dist[4] = 2` (since 1 + 1 < \u221e).\n\n4. **Visit Node 4**:\n   - Since node 4 is the destination, we stop here.\n\nFrom node 4, we backtrack to reconstruct the path:\n- From 4, we came from 1.\n- From 1, we came from 8.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 8 to node 4 is: 8->1->4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->1->4"}]
