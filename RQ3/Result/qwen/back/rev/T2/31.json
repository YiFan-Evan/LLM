In this case, since the graph does not specify any edge weights, we assume it's an unweighted graph. Therefore, BFS is appropriate because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which naturally leads to finding the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start from the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the current depth level.\n3. Move to the next depth level and repeat until the destination node is found.\n4. Keep track of the path during traversal to reconstruct the shortest path once the destination is reached.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 2 and the destination node 4:\n\n1. Start at node 2.\n2. Explore its neighbors: nodes 5 and 6. Neither is our destination.\n3. Move to the next level, explore neighbors of nodes 5 and 6. Node 5 has no more neighbors, but node 6 has one neighbor, node 3, which also isn't our destination.\n4. Move further, explore neighbors of node 3: node 6 (already explored) and node 6\u2019s other neighbor, node 7, which again is not our destination.\n5. Move further, explore neighbors of node 6 again, but it doesn\u2019t lead us closer.\n6. Finally, go back to the initial neighbors of node 2 (since we have not fully explored all possibilities yet) and explore node 4. This is our destination.\n\nFollowing the BFS approach, the shortest path from node 2 to node 4 involves going through node 4 directly if possible, or via intermediate nodes if needed. Here, the direct path is available.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 4], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 6], [4, 7]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for unweighted graphs and guarantees to find the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1.
