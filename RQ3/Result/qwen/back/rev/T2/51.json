One of the most common and efficient algorithms for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph (where all edges have equal weight) is **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**.\n\n### Explanation of BFS:\n- **Queue**: BFS uses a queue data structure to explore all possible paths level by level.\n- **Visited Set**: To avoid revisiting nodes and getting stuck in cycles, we maintain a set of visited nodes.\n- **Parent Dictionary**: This helps us keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n\n### Steps Involved in BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing the queue with the start node and marking it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node, check if it is the destination. If not, enqueue all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet.\n3. **Track Path**: Use the parent dictionary to trace back the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Applying BFS to the Given Problem:\nGiven the graph:\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- Edges: [[0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [3, 6]]\n\nStarting node: 2\nDestination: 5\n\nLet's apply BFS:\n\n1. Initialize the queue with node 2 and mark it as visited.\n2. Dequeue node 2, check its neighbors (3 and 5). Mark 3 and 5 as visited.\n3. Enqueue node 3 and node 5.\n4. Dequeue node 3, check its neighbors (0, 1, 4, 6). Node 6 is already visited, so only consider 0, 1, 4. Mark them as visited.\n5. Enqueue nodes 0, 1, and 4.\n6. Dequeue node 5 (destination found).\n\nSince we found the destination node 5 directly connected from node 2, we do not need to continue further.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe shortest path from node 2 to node 5 is simply the direct edge between them.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->5"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [3, 6]]} The start node: 5 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem of finding the shortest path in a graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, meaning it visits all the neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a destination node is reached, the path taken is the shortest one.\n\n### Explanation of BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing the queue with the start node and marking it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node, check if it is the destination.
