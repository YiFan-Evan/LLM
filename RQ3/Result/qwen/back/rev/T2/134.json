Since all edges are unweighted in this case, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start from the source node and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Use a queue to explore nodes level by level. Add neighboring nodes to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\n3. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path leading to each node so that once the target node is reached, we can trace back the shortest path.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n- Start from node `2`.\n- Explore its neighbors: nodes `4` and `14`.\n- Continue exploring nodes level by level until we reach node `8`.\n\nLet's go through the steps explicitly:\n\n1. Start at node `2`.\n2. From node `2`, visit its neighbors: `4` and `14`.\n3. From node `4`, visit its neighbors: `7`.\n4. From node `14`, visit its neighbors: `9`, `1`, `13`.\n5. From node `9`, visit its neighbors: none.\n6. From node `1`, visit its neighbors: `14` (already visited), `13` (already visited).\n7. From node `13`, visit its neighbors: `0`.\n8. From node `0`, visit its neighbors: `8`, `13` (already visited).\n9. Node `8` is reached directly from node `0`.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node `2` to node `8` involves going through nodes `2 -> 0 -> 8`.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->0->8"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 8], [0, 13], [0, 1], [1, 14], [2, 4], [2, 14], [3, 6], [4, 7], [5, 6], [5, 10], [6, 12], [8, 10], [9, 14], [11, 14]]} The start node: 8 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node `8` to node `2`, we can again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm since the graph is unweighted.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialization**: Start from the source node `8` and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.
