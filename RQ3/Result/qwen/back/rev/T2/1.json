Since all edges are considered to have equal weight, BFS is a straightforward approach to finding the shortest path.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the given source node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3. Track the distance and path taken to reach each node.\n4.
