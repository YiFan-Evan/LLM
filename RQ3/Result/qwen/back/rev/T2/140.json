However, since the given graph does not have any specified weights, we assume all edges have equal weight (i.e., a unit distance). This makes the problem simpler and we can treat it as an unweighted graph.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by setting the distance to the start node (node 9) as zero and to all other nodes as infinity.\n2. **Queue Initialization**: Use a priority queue (or a simple list if not available) to manage nodes based on their current shortest distance from the start node. Initially, insert the start node into the queue.\n3. **Processing Nodes**: While the queue is not empty, take the node with the smallest distance from the queue. For each neighbor of the current node:\n   - If the new path to the neighbor through the current node is shorter than the previously known distance to that neighbor, update the distance and add the neighbor to the queue (if not already present).\n4. **Termination**: Continue this process until the queue is empty or the target node (node 1) is processed.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   -
