Since all edges are unweighted (we assume they have equal weight), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Move to the next level and explore their neighbors.\n4. Continue until the target node is reached.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 5.\n2. Explore its neighbors: node 7.\n3. From node 7, explore its neighbors: node 1 (already visited), so move on.\n4. From node 5, explore its other neighbor: node 3.\n5. From node 3, explore its neighbors: node 5 (already visited), node 24.\n6. From node 24, explore its neighbors: node 3 (already visited), node 4, node 18.\n7.

Node 17 is the target node.\n\nNow let's trace back the path from node 17 to node 5:\n- Node 17 is connected to node 11.\n- Node 11 is connected to node 19.\n- Node 19 is connected to node 23.\n- Node 23 is connected to node 20.\n- Node 20 is connected to node 22.\n- Node 22 is connected to node 24.\n- Node 24 is connected to node 3.\n- Node 3 is connected to node 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->3->24->22->20->19->11->17"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 12], [0, 2], [1, 9], [1, 10], [1, 7], [2, 17], [3, 5], [3, 24], [4, 24], [5, 7], [6, 15], [8, 22], [10, 17], [11, 19], [13, 22], [14, 22], [15, 16], [15, 21], [18, 22], [19, 23], [20, 23], [20, 22], [21, 22], [22, 24]]} The start node: 17 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve for the shortest path from node 17 to node 5 using BFS, we will follow these steps:\n\n1.
