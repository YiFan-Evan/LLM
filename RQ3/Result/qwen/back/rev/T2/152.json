In this case, since the graph does not specify any edge weights, we can assume it is unweighted.\n\nGiven this, we will use BFS because it explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a destination node is found, it is by the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start from the source node.\n2. Explore its neighbors.\n3. Mark them as visited and enqueue them.\n4. Move to the next level and repeat until the destination node is found.\n\nLet's apply BFS to our specific graph:\n\n1. Start from node 11.\n2. Enqueue its neighbors: node 5 and node 12.\n3. Dequeue node 12 (since it is closer to node 3).\n   - Node 12's neighbors are nodes 2, 4, 5, and 11. Nodes 2 and 4 are new and added to the queue.\n4.
