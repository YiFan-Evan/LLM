Given that all the edges in the graph are unweighted (meaning they have equal weight), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start from the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the source node.\n3. Then explore all the neighbors of those nodes, and so on.\n4. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n5. Stop when you reach the destination node.\n\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node being 8 and the destination node being 1.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (8) to it.\n2. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node for reconstructing the path later.\n3. Mark the start node as visited.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - If this node is the destination (1), stop.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited, keeping track of their parent.\n\n### Execution:\n- Start at node 8.\n- Node 8 is connected to node 6.\n- From node 6, we go to node 11.\n- From node 11, we go to node 1.\n\nThus, the path from 8 to 1 is: 8->6->11->1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->6->11->1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 4], [1, 4], [1, 11], [2, 10], [3, 7], [3, 12], [5, 7], [6, 8], [6, 11], [7, 11], [10, 12]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we will use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

Also, create a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node.\n2. **Mark Visited**: Mark the start node as visited.\n3. **Process Queue**: While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - If this node is the destination (8), stop.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited, keeping track of their parent.\n\n### Execution:\n1.
