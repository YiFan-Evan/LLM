One of the most common and efficient ones for unweighted graphs is **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**. BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest path from the starting node.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start with the given start node (8). Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n2. **Mark Visited Nodes**: Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3. **Track Parent Nodes**: Maintain a mapping from each node to its parent node to reconstruct the path once the target node (3) is reached.\n\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 3:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Start node: 8\n   - Queue: [8]\n   - Visited nodes: {8}\n   - Parent mapping: {8: None}\n\n2. **Processing Nodes**:\n   - Dequeue node 8. Its neighbors are 6 and 3.\n     - Node 6: Not visited, so enqueue 6 and mark it as visited. Update parent mapping: {6: 8}.\n     - Node 3: Not visited, so enqueue 3 and mark it as visited. Update parent mapping: {3: 8}.\n   - Dequeue node 6. Its neighbors are 0 and 12.\n     - Node 0: Already visited, skip.\n     - Node 12: Already visited, skip.\n   - Dequeue node 3. We have reached the target node.\n\nSince we've reached node 3, we can now trace back the path using the parent mapping:\n- Node 3's parent is 8.\n- Node 8's parent is None (starting node).\n\nThus, the path from 8 to 3 is: 8 -> 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->3"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 6], [1, 7], [1, 9], [2, 4], [3, 10], [3, 11], [3, 8], [4, 11], [5, 9], [6, 8], [6, 12]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 3 to node 8 in the given graph, we can again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
