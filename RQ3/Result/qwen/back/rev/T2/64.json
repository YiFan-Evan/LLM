However, for simplicity and given the small size of the graph provided, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for unweighted graphs like the one provided.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Then explore all their neighbors, and so on.\n4. Track the distance from the source to each node.\n5. Stop when you reach the target node.\n\nLet's apply this method to the given graph:\n\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\nEdges: [[0, 1], [0, 7], [1, 5], [1, 3], [2, 7], [3, 4], [4, 6]]\n\nStart node: 6\nDestination: 5\n\nWe will track the path by maintaining a list of previous nodes to reconstruct the shortest path once we reach the destination.\n\n1.

BFS explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest path from the start node.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n\n1. **Initialize**: \n   - Create a queue and add the start node (5) to it.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to keep track of the path taken to reach each node. Initially, set the path for the start node as [5].\n\n2. **Explore Nodes**:\n   - Dequeue a node and check if it is the destination node (6).\n   - If not, enqueue all its neighboring nodes that haven't been visited yet, along with the updated path.\n\n3. **Repeat until Destination Found**:\n   - Continue dequeuing and enqueuing until the destination node (6) is found.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [5]\n   - Path: {5: [5]}\n\n2. **First Level**:\n   - Dequeue node 5.\n   - Neighbors of 5: [4] (since 5 is connected to 1 and 1 is connected to 4)\n   - Enqueue 4 and update path: {5: [5], 4: [5, 4]}\n   - Queue: [4]\n\n3. **Second Level**:\n   - Dequeue node 4.\n   - Neighbors of 4: [3, 6]\n   - Enqueue 3 and update path: {5: [5], 4: [5, 4], 3: [5, 4, 3]}\n   - Enqueue 6 and update path: {5: [5], 4: [5, 4], 3: [5, 4, 3], 6: [5, 4, 6]}\n   - Queue: [3, 6]\n\n4. **Third Level**:\n   - Dequeue node 3.\n   - Neighbors of 3: [1] (but 1 has already been visited)\n   - Queue: [6]\n\n5. **Fourth Level**:\n   - Dequeue node 6.\n   - Node 6 is the destination.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 5 to node 6 is [5, 4, 6].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->4->6"}]
