In this case, since all the edges can be assumed to have equal weight (no specific weights are provided), BFS is a suitable choice.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using nodes and edges. Nodes are the points or vertices, and edges are the connections between these nodes.\n2. **Queue for BFS**: BFS uses a queue to explore nodes level by level. We start from the source node, explore its neighbors, then their neighbors, and so on until we reach the target node.\n3. **Tracking Path**: To keep track of the path, we can use a dictionary to record the parent of each node visited during the BFS traversal. This helps in reconstructing the path once we reach the destination.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue for BFS and enqueue the start node.\n2. Use a dictionary to track the parent of each node.\n3. Dequeue a node, check if it\u2019s the destination. If yes, break.\n4. Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them with the current node as their parent.\n5. Repeat until the queue is empty or the destination is reached.\n6. Reconstruct the path from the destination to the start using the parent dictionary.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n- Start Node: 3\n- Destination Node: 6\n\nLet's perform the BFS:\n\n1. Start at node 3.\n2. Enqueue 3 and set its parent to None.\n3. Dequeue 3 and enqueue its neighbors (if any). Here, node 3 has neighbor 6.\n4. Dequeue 6 and find it\u2019s the destination.\n\nSince we reached the destination directly from 3, the shortest path is simply the edge connecting them.\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is: 3->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 12], [1, 7], [1, 4], [2, 4], [2, 12], [3, 6], [5, 6], [6, 10], [6, 11], [6, 8], [7, 9], [8, 12]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 6 to node 3 in the given graph, we can again use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
