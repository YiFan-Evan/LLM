In this case, since the graph does not have specified weights on its edges, we will use BFS.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n\n1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** BFS explores vertices in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex. It uses a queue to ensure that the shortest path to each vertex is found before moving on to farther vertices.\n   \n2. **Graph Representation:** \n   - Nodes are represented as a list of integers.\n   - Edges are represented as pairs of integers indicating connections between nodes.\n\n3. **Initialization:**\n   - Start with the source node and mark it as visited.\n   - Use a queue to manage the nodes to be processed next.\n\n4. **Processing Nodes:**\n   - Dequeue a node, check if it is the destination.\n   - If not, enqueue all its neighbors that have not been visited yet.\n\n5. **Tracking Path:**\n   - Keep track of the path taken to reach each node to reconstruct the shortest path at the end.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n\nGiven:\n- Start Node: 8\n- Destination Node: 4\n\n#### Steps:\n\n1. Initialize the queue with the start node (8).\n2. Mark node 8 as visited.\n3. Dequeue node 8 and enqueue its neighbors (if any).\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n1. Queue: [8]\n2. Visited: {8}\n3. Neighbors of 8: 9 (enqueue 9)\n   - Queue: [9]\n   - Visited: {8, 9}\n\n4. Dequeue node 9 and enqueue its neighbors (if any):\n   - Neighbors of 9: None (already visited)\n   - Queue: []\n\nSince node 9 has no unvisited neighbors, we dequeue the next node in the queue (which is empty, so we need to backtrack).\n\nWe now need to consider other paths. Let's re-evaluate:\n\n1. Start Node: 8\n2. From 8, go to 9, then from 9 to its neighbor 1.\n   - Queue: [1]\n   - Visited: {8, 9, 1}\n\n3.
