One of the most common algorithms for this purpose is Dijkstra's Algorithm, which works well for graphs with non-negative edge weights. \n\nHere are the steps involved in applying Dijkstra's Algorithm:\n1. Assign a tentative distance value to every node: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\n2. Set the initial node as current. Mark all other nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n4. When we are done considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will never be checked again.\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (which would indicate there is no connection), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node\", and go back to step 3.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given graph with the start node 4 and the destination node 7:\n\n1.

Next node with the smallest distance: node 5 or node 11. Let's choose node 5.\n\n6. From node 5, consider its neighbors:\n   - Node 0: dist[0] = 0 + weight(5, 0) = 0 + 0 = 0\n   - Node 4: already visited.\n\n7. Mark node 5 as visited.\n\n8. Next node with the smallest distance: node 11.\n\n9. From node 11, consider its neighbors:\n   - Node 8: dist[8] = 0 + weight(11, 8) = 0 + 0 = 0\n   - Node 4: already visited.\n\n10.
