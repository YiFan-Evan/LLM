From node 10, explore its neighbors: Node 10 connects to nodes 4, 6, and 7.\n4.

BFS is particularly well-suited for unweighted graphs as it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest path.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize BFS**: Start from node 6. Initialize a queue and add node 6 to it. Use a dictionary to track the parent of each node (i.e., the node from which we arrived at the current node).\n\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Dequeue the first node (node 6). For each neighbor of the dequeued node, if the neighbor hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited and enqueue it while recording its parent.\n\n3. **Track Path**: Continue this process until we reach node 13. Once node 13 is reached, trace back through the recorded parents to reconstruct the path.\n\nLet's go through the BFS steps for the given graph:\n\n1. **Start at node 6**.\n   - Enqueue node 6.\n   - Mark node 6 as visited.\n   - Parents: {6: None}\n\n2. **Dequeue node 6**.\n   - Neighbors of node 6: [10].\n   - Enqueue node 10.\n   - Parents: {6: None, 10: 6}\n\n3. **Dequeue node 10**.\n   - Neighbors of node 10: [4, 6, 7, 13].\n   - Enqueue nodes 4, 7, and 13 (but not 6 since it's already visited).\n   - Parents: {6: None, 10: 6, 4: 10, 7: 10, 13: 10}\n\n4. **Dequeue node 4** (not needed for the path to 13).\n5. **Dequeue node 7** (not needed for the path to 13).\n6. **Dequeue node 13**.\n   - We've reached our destination.\n\nNow, tracing back from node 13 to node 6 using the recorded parents:\n\n- Node 13 -> Node 10 (from parents)\n- Node 10 -> Node 6 (from parents)\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 6 to node 13 is: 6->10->13.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->10->13."}]
