Now, we move to node 6 and its neighbors (none directly lead to node 1), so we move to node 7 and its neighbors (none lead to node 1 either). Since neither node 6 nor node 7 leads directly or indirectly to node 1, we need to retrace our steps.\n5. Revisiting node 0, we see that there are no other direct paths to node 1 except those already explored. Therefore, we realize that node 1 is not reachable from node 0 in this graph.\n\nSince node 1 is not reachable from node 0, there is no valid path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: There is no path from node 0 to node 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 4], [3, 6], [4, 5], [5, 6]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) since the graph is unweighted.
