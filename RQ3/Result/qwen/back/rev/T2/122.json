In this scenario, since all edges are unweighted (assuming equal weight), BFS is an appropriate choice because it efficiently finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of the process using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start with the given start node (8) and mark it as visited.\n2. **Queue Initialization**: Use a queue to explore nodes level by level. Initially, insert the start node into the queue.\n3. **Explore Neighbors**: For each node, explore its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited:\n   - Mark it as visited.\n   - Record the path taken to reach this neighbor.\n   - Insert it into the queue for further exploration.\n4. **Path Recording**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node. This helps reconstruct the shortest path once the destination is reached.\n5. **Destination Check**: If the destination node (12) is found, stop the search and reconstruct the path.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to our specific problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n- **Start Node**: 8\n- **Edges**: \n  - 8 -> 4\n  - 8 -> 5\n\n**Initial Queue**: [8]\n\n1.
