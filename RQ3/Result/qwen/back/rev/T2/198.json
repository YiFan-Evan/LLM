This algorithm works well for graphs with non-negative edge weights. Here are the fundamental steps involved:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Mark all nodes as unvisited.\n   - Assign a tentative distance value to every node. Set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\n\n2. **Set the current node**:\n   - Start with the initial node. Set the current node to the one with the smallest tentative distance value among the unvisited nodes.\n\n3. **Update distances**:\n   - For the current node, consider all its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node.\n   - Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\n\n4. **Mark the current node as visited**:\n   - Once we have considered all the neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\n\n5. **Repeat until done**:\n   - Continue this process until all nodes are visited or until we reach the destination node.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given graph:\n\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\n- Edges: [[0, 19], [1, 12], [2, 14], [2, 23], [2, 6], [3, 15], [3, 24], [4, 18], [5, 15], [6, 22], [6, 19], [7, 23], [8, 13], [8, 19], [9, 17], [9, 15], [10, 11], [10, 19], [10, 18], [11, 20], [12, 16], [12, 24], [16, 18], [21, 22]]\n- Starting node: 3\n- Destination node: 22\n\nFollowing Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm step-by-step:\n\n1.

Move to the next unvisited node with the smallest distance, which is 15.\n\n6.

Update distances:\n    - Check neighbors of 9 (17, 15).\n    - No further updates needed.\n\n13. Mark 9 as visited.\n\n14. Next node is 5.\n\n15.
