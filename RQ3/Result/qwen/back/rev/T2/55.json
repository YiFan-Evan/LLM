However, since the given graph is unweighted (all edges have the same cost), we can also use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is simpler and more efficient for such cases.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using nodes and edges. Nodes are the points in the graph, and edges are the connections between these points.\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS explores all the vertices of a graph level by level. It starts at the root node (or any arbitrary starting node) and explores its neighbors before moving to the next level of nodes.\n3. **Queue Data Structure**: BFS uses a queue to manage the order in which nodes are explored. A node is added to the queue when it is discovered, and it is removed from the queue once all of its neighbors have been processed.\n4. **Tracking Paths**: While performing BFS, we can keep track of the path taken to reach each node from the starting node. This helps us reconstruct the shortest path once the target node is reached.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node (node 2).\n2. Use a dictionary to store the parent of each node to trace back the path.\n3. Enqueue the starting node.\n4. Dequeue a node and explore all its neighbors.\n5. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\n6. Repeat until the target node (node 3) is dequeued.\n7. Once the target node is found, trace back the path using the recorded parents.\n\n### Execution:\n- Start at node 2.\n- Explore neighbors: Node 3 and Node 7.\n- Visit node 3 directly, and mark node 2 as its parent.\n- Since node 3 is the target, stop.\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is: 2->3"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem of finding the shortest path from node 3 to node 2 in the given graph, we can again utilize Breadth-First Search (BFS).
