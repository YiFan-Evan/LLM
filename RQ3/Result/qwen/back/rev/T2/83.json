However, given the simplicity of the graph provided, we can also determine the shortest path through careful inspection or using a breadth-first search (BFS), which is efficient for unweighted graphs like this one.\n\nHere are the steps we would follow:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start from node 1.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Look at all direct neighbors of the current node.\n3. **Track Distance and Path**: Keep track of the distance to each node and the path taken to reach that node.\n4. **Select Next Node**: Move to the nearest unvisited neighbor until we reach the destination.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n- From node 1, we can directly go to node 12.\n- From node 12, there are no direct paths to node 10. We must explore further.\n- From node 12, the next possible moves are back to node 0 or to node 1. Since we need to reach node 10, we have to look elsewhere.\n- Let's move on to other parts of the graph:\n  - From node 0, we can go to node 8 or node 12. Node 12 has already been visited.\n  - From node 8, we can go to node 0 or node 11.
