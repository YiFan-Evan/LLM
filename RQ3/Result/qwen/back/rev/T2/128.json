Since the graph provided does not specify any weights, we'll assume that all edges have the same weight, making BFS an appropriate choice for finding the shortest path.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n4. Repeat until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\n\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 12.\n2. From node 12, explore its neighbors: 0 and 4.\n3. From node 0, explore its neighbors: 11 and 12 (already visited).\n4. From node 4, explore its neighbors: none (already visited).\n5. From node 11, explore its neighbors: 7, 8, 9, 10, 14 (all already visited except 7).\n6. From node 7, explore its neighbors: 5, 6, 11 (already visited).\n7.
