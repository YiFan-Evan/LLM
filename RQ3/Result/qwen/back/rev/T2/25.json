In this case, BFS is more straightforward because there are no weighted edges.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\n2. Use a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parent nodes.\n3. Process each node in the queue by checking its neighbors:\n   - If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and set its parent as the current node.\n   - If the neighbor is the target node, stop the search.\n4.
