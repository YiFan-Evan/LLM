Since all the edges in the given graph are unweighted (i.e., they have equal weight), BFS is a suitable choice for finding the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps for BFS:\n1. Start by adding the initial node to a queue.\n2. Mark the initial node as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and check if it is the target node.\n4. If it is not the target node, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n5.
