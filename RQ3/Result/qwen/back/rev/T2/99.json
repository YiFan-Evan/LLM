Given that all the edges in this graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level and guarantees to find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can apply BFS to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start at the given start node (4). Mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n2. **Explore**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node (11). If yes, stop; otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue dequeuing and exploring until the target node is found.\n\nLet's walk through the BFS process for the given graph:\n\n- Start at node 4.\n- From node 4, we can go to node 1 (via edge [1, 4]) and node 8 (via edge [4, 8]).\n- From node 1, we can go to node 7 (via edge [1, 7]) and node 12 (via edge [1, 12]).\n- From node 8, we can go to node 9 (via edge [8, 9]).\n- From node 9, we can go to node 11 (via edge [9, 11]).\n- Now, we have reached node 11 from node 9.\n\nFollowing the BFS traversal path:\n- Node 4 -> Node 8 -> Node 9 -> Node 11\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->8->9->11"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 11], [1, 7], [1, 4], [1, 12], [2, 5], [2, 7], [3, 11], [4, 8], [6, 10], [8, 9], [9, 11], [10, 11]]} The start node: 11 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
