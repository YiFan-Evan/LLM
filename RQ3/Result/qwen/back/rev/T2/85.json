In this case, since all the edges can be assumed to have equal weight, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the current depth level.\n3. Move to the next depth level and repeat until the destination node is found.\n4. Record the path taken to reach the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n### Graph Representation\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\nEdges: [[0, 9], [1, 6], [1, 8], [1, 9], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 8], [4, 7], [5, 12], [9, 11], [10, 11]]\n\n### Starting Node: 7\n### Destination Node: 2\n\nWe'll perform BFS to find the shortest path from node 7 to node 2.\n\n1.
