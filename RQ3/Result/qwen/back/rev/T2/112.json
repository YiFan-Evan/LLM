Since all edges are unweighted, BFS is sufficient and efficient.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using nodes and edges.\n   - Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\n   - Edges: [[0, 2], [0, 7], [0, 12], [1, 9], [2, 3], [3, 6], [4, 12], [5, 11], [6, 9], [7, 8], [7, 11], [9, 10]]\n\n2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:\n   - BFS explores nodes level by level. It starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n   - This ensures that the shortest path is found because BFS expands the frontier between discovered and undiscovered vertices uniformly across the breadth.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Initialize BFS**:\n   - Start from the source node (5).\n   - Use a queue to manage the nodes to be explored.\n   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node for reconstructing the path.\n\n2. **BFS Execution**:\n   - Enqueue the start node (5).\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore its neighbors.\n   - If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n   - Record the parent of each node.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Once the target node (7) is dequeued, trace back from the target to the start using the recorded parents.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n\nStarting from node 5:\n- Dequeue 5, enqueue 11 (parent of 5 is 5).\n- Dequeue 11, enqueue 7 (parent of 11 is 7).\n- Dequeue 7, target reached.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n\n- Node 7 -> Node 11 -> Node 5\n\nSince we want the path from node 5 to node 7, we reverse the path:\n- Node 5 -> Node 11 -> Node 7\n\nHowever, since we need to go from 5 to 7 directly, we see that the direct BFS traversal already gives us the path from 5 to 7 via 11.\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is: 5->11->7"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 7], [0, 12], [1, 9], [2, 3], [3, 6], [4, 12], [5, 11], [6, 9], [7, 8], [7, 11], [9, 10]]} The start node: 7 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 7 to node 5, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
