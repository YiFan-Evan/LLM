One common approach is Dijkstra's algorithm, which is particularly useful for graphs with non-negative weights. However, since our graph doesn't specify any weights, we can assume all edges have equal weight. In this case, Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a simpler and more efficient solution.\n\nHere are the fundamental steps for BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by marking the starting node as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Processing**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node. If so, reconstruct the path and stop.\n3. **Exploration**: For each adjacent node of the dequeued node that hasn\u2019t been visited yet, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n4. **Repeat**: Repeat step 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n5. **Path Reconstruction**: Reconstruct the path from the start node to the target node using the information stored during the BFS process.\n\nNow let's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n**Graph Representation:**\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- Edges: [[0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]\n\n**Starting Node:** 1  \n**Target Node:** 3\n\n### Steps:\n\n1.
