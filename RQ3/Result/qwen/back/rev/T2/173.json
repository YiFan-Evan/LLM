Here are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Assign a tentative distance value to every node. Set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes. Set the initial node as current.\n\n2. **Processing**: For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. When all neighbors have been considered, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\n\n3. **Selection**: If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\n\n4. **Iteration**: Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \"current node\", and go back to step 2.\n\nGiven the graph, the start node is 14, and the destination is 17. Let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n- Start at node 14.\n- From 14, the possible next nodes are 19, 22, and 21.
