Here, BFS is a simpler choice because the weights are uniform.\n\nBFS works by exploring all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order. It starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores all the neighboring nodes before moving to the next level neighbors. This ensures that the shortest path to any node is found first.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node as 1 and the target node as 5:\n\n1.
