BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest path.\n\nHere's how we apply BFS:\n\n1. Start at the given starting node (in this case, node 6).\n2. Explore its neighbors.\n3. Add those neighbors to a queue and mark them as visited.\n4. Move to the next node in the queue and repeat the process.\n5.

BFS is ideal for this purpose because it explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to nodes at the next depth level, ensuring that the first time the target node is reached, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's perform the BFS step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start at node 2. Mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**:\n   - Node 2's neighbors are node 4.\n   - Add node 4 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n3. **Next Level**:\n   - Dequeue node 4.\n   - Node 4's neighbors are node 7 and node 2 (but node 2 is already visited).\n   - Add node 7 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n4. **Continue**:\n   - Dequeue node 7.\n   - Node 7's neighbors are node 3 and node 4 (both already visited).\n5. **Next Level**:\n   - Dequeue node 4 again (not needed since it\u2019s already processed).\n   - Dequeue node 3.\n   - Node 3's neighbors are node 1 and node 7 (both already visited).\n6. **Next Level**:\n   - Dequeue node 1.\n   - Node 1's neighbors are node 0 and node 3 (both already visited).\n7. **Next Level**:\n   - Dequeue node 0.\n   - Node 0's neighbors are node 6 and node 1 (node 1 is already visited).\n   - Add node 6 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n8. **Target Found**:\n   - Dequeue node 6.\n   - Node 6's neighbors are node 5 and node 0 (both already visited).\n\nWe have now found node 6, which is our target.
