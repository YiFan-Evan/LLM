Since the problem does not specify any edge weights, we'll assume all edges have equal weight, making BFS a suitable choice.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n1. **Graph Representation**: We represent the graph using nodes and edges.\n2. **Queue for BFS**: BFS uses a queue to explore all the vertices of a graph level by level.\n3. **Tracking Path**: While performing BFS, we track the path from the start node to every other node to reconstruct the shortest path once we reach the target node.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node.\n2. Use a dictionary to store the parent of each node to keep track of the path.\n3. Perform BFS by dequeuing a node, checking its neighbors, and enqueuing them if they haven't been visited yet.\n4. If we reach the target node, reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary.\n\n### Applying BFS:\n\n- Start at node 8.\n- Enqueue 8.\n- Visit neighbors of 8 (node 13 and node 9).\n- Continue until we reach node 4.\n\nLet's trace the BFS step-by-step:\n1. Start at node 8.\n2. Enqueue 8.\n3. Dequeue 8, visit neighbors (13, 9). Enqueue 13 and 9.\n4. Dequeue 9, visit neighbors (11). Enqueue 11.\n5. Dequeue 11, visit neighbors (5, 7). Enqueue 5 and 7.\n6. Dequeue 7, visit neighbors (12, 14). Enqueue 12 and 14.\n7. Dequeue 14, visit neighbors (0, 2, 3, 4). Enqueue 0, 2, 3, and 4.\n8.
