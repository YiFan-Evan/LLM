However, since the graph provided here is relatively small, we can also use a simple breadth-first search (BFS) approach, which works well for unweighted graphs (i.e., all edges have equal weight).\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step explanation using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start from the given node (node 3). Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it. Also, maintain a dictionary to keep track of the path from the start node to each node.\n\n2. **Processing**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the destination node. If it is, we are done. Otherwise, enqueue all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet, updating the path information accordingly.\n\n3. **Termination**: Continue until the destination node is dequeued or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\n\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- Edges: [[0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 7], [5, 6]]\n- Start node: 3\n- Destination: 6\n\n**Step-by-step Execution:**\n\n1.
