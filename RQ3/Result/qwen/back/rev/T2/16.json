In this case, given that the graph does not have weighted edges (all edges are considered to have equal weight), BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is reached via the shortest path.\n\nStarting from node 5, we explore its neighbors and continue exploring their neighbors until we reach node 4. We'll keep track of the path taken to ensure we find the shortest route.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. Start at node 5.\n2. From node 5, the possible neighbors are [0, 1]. Neither of these lead directly to 4.\n3. Move to the next level of nodes reachable from the initial neighbors. From node 0, the neighbors are [5, 4]. Here we find node 4, so we have found a path.\n4.

BFS explores all the vertices of a graph in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex. Here\u2019s how we can apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 5:\n\n1. **Initialize the BFS**: Start at node 4. Mark node 4 as visited and add it to the queue.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: Dequeue the current node and explore its neighbors. For each neighbor that hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n3. **Check for Destination**: If the neighbor is the destination node (node 5), record the path and stop the search.\n\nLet's go through the steps in detail:\n\n1. **Start at Node 4**:\n   - Visited Nodes: {4}\n   - Queue: [4]\n   - Path Record: {4: [4]}\n\n2. **Dequeue Node 4**:\n   - Neighbors of 4: [0, 2]\n   - Mark 0 and 2 as visited and enqueue them.\n   - Update Path Record: \n     - 0: [4, 0]\n     - 2: [4, 2]\n\n3. **Dequeue Node 0**:\n   - Neighbors of 0: [5, 4]\n   - Since 5 is the destination and it is not visited, record the path [4, 0, 5].\n\nSince we have reached the destination node 5, we stop the search.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->0->5"}]
