Since all the edges in the given graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice as it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere\u2019s how we apply BFS to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a queue and adding the start node (node 7) to it. Also, initialize a dictionary to keep track of the path taken to reach each node, starting with the start node having itself as its predecessor.\n   \n2. **Exploration**: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node. For each of its neighbors, if the neighbor hasn't been visited yet, mark the neighbor as visited and set the current node as the neighbor's predecessor. Add the neighbor to the queue.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the destination node (node 1) is dequeued, reconstruct the path from the start node to the destination node using the predecessor information.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n1.
