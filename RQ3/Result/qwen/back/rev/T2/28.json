However, since the graph provided does not have weights on the edges and all connections are presumably equal, BFS is a suitable choice due to its simplicity and effectiveness for unweighted graphs.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialize**: Start with the source node and mark it as visited.\n2. **Queue**: Use a queue data structure to manage the nodes to be explored next.\n3. **Explore**: Dequeue a node, check if it is the target node. If yes, stop; otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n4. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path from the start node to the current node using a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the target node is found.\n\n### Applying BFS to the Problem:\n\nGiven:\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- Edges: [[0, 2], [1, 4], [1, 5], [1, 7], [2, 4], [3, 6], [3, 5]]\n- Start Node: 6\n- Destination: 4\n\n#### Step-by-step BFS Execution:\n1.
