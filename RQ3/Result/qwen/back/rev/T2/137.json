Since all edges in this graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere's how we can apply BFS:\n\n1.

Since 6 is already visited, move to 5.\n- Node 5 has neighbors [9], which we skip.\n- Next, explore node 14, then its neighbors [6, 10]. Since 6 is already visited, we visit 10.\n\nWe've reached the destination node 10. Now, we need to backtrack to determine the path.\n\nBacktracking:\n- From 10, we came from 14.\n- From 14, we came from 6.\n\nThus, the shortest path is 6->14->10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->14->10"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 13], [1, 11], [2, 8], [2, 5], [3, 6], [4, 5], [4, 6], [5, 9], [6, 14], [7, 11], [7, 9], [8, 13], [10, 12], [10, 14]]} The start node: 10 The destination: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 10 to node 6 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
