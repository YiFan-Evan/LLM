However, since our graph doesn't have explicit weights on the edges (all edges are considered to have the same weight), we can simplify the process by using a breadth-first search (BFS). BFS explores all possible paths level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the destination node, it is via the shortest path.\n\nLet's perform the BFS:\n\n1. Start at node 1.\n2.
