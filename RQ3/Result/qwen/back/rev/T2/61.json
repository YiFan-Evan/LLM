In this case, since all edges are unweighted, BFS is appropriate because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start from the initial node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n3.
