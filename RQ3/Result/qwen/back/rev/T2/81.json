In this case, since all the edges can be assumed to have equal weight, BFS is an appropriate choice because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nGiven:\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\n- Edges: [[0, 6], [0, 11], [1, 11], [1, 3], [2, 4], [2, 12], [3, 10], [3, 12], [5, 9], [5, 8], [7, 8], [7, 11]]\n- Start node: 2\n- Destination: 3\n\nWe can apply BFS as follows:\n\n1.

Dequeue node 12 and enqueue its neighbors (3, 10).\n5.
