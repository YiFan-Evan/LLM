However, since the graph described here does not have any weights on its edges, we can simplify the problem by using a breadth-first search (BFS), which is suitable for unweighted graphs and will help us find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nBreadth-first search works by exploring all the vertices of a graph level by level. Starting from the source vertex, BFS visits all the vertices at the current distance before moving on to vertices that are farther away. This ensures that when we reach our destination, we have found the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow:\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node.\n4. If the dequeued node is the target node, stop the search.\n5. Otherwise, enqueue all the adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet.\n6. Keep track of the path by storing the parent node of each node visited.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n1. Start node = 1, Target node = 4.\n2. Initialize the queue and mark node 1 as visited.\n3. Dequeue node 1.\n4. From node 1, we can visit nodes 2, 3, 5, 7.\n5. Continue this process until we reach node 4.\n\nBy applying BFS, we can trace back the path from the target node to the start node.\n\nAfter executing BFS, we find that the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is via nodes 1 -> 2 -> 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 3], [1, 5], [1, 7], [2, 4], [5, 6]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm because the graph is unweighted.

Start from the initial node (node 4).\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Add the neighbors to the queue if they haven't been visited.\n4. Mark the current node as visited.\n5.
