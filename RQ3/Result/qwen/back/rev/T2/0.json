Given that all edges in the graph have equal weight (no edge costs are specified), BFS is sufficient for finding the shortest path.\n\nHere are the steps for using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start at the source node. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it. Also, keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n2. **Traversal**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node.
