In this case, since no weights are specified for the edges, we can assume all edges have equal weight. BFS is simpler and more appropriate here.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. **Initialize**: Start at the source node (node 6). Create a queue and add the starting node to it. Mark the starting node as visited.\n2. **Process the queue**: While the queue is not empty, take the first node from the queue. If this node is the destination (node 10), stop and trace back the path.\n3. **Expand neighbors**: For each neighbor of the current node that hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited, record its parent, and add it to the queue.\n4. **Trace back the path**: Once the destination node is found, trace back the path from the destination to the start using the recorded parents.\n\nLet's perform these steps:\n\n1. **Initialize**: \n   - Queue: [6]\n   - Visited: {6}\n   - Parents: {6: None}\n\n2. **Process the queue**:\n   - Dequeue node 6.\n   - Neighbors of 6: [10, 8, 11].\n     - Node 10: Not visited.
