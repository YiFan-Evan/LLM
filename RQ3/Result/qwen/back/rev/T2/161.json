However, given the relatively small size of the graph, we can also use Breadth-First Search (BFS) for simplicity, since all edge weights are equal.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start at the source node.\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. Mark the current node as visited to avoid revisiting it.\n4. Continue exploring until the target node is found or all reachable nodes have been explored.\n\nLet's apply BFS to our specific problem:\n\n- Start at node 4.\n- Explore its neighbors: nodes 7, 10, 13, 15.\n- From these, explore further neighbors of nodes 7, 10, 13, and 15 until reaching node 5.\n\nNow, let's trace the BFS steps:\n\n1.

BFS explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path is found.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start at the source node (node 5). Create a queue and add the source node to it. Also, maintain a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path later.\n2. **Explore**: Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node (node 4). If yes, stop. Otherwise, enqueue all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet.\n3. **Track Path**: As you visit each node, update the parent dictionary to remember where you came from.\n4. **Repeat**: Continue until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's apply BFS to our specific problem:\n\n1. Start at node 5.\n2. Enqueue neighbors of node 5: node 17.\n3. Dequeue node 17.\n   - Neighbors of node 17: nodes 16, 24.\n4. Dequeue node 16.\n   - Neighbors of node 16: none.\n5.

Dequeue node 4.\n    - Node 4 is the target node.\n\nNow we reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary:\n- Node 4 is reached from node 15.\n- Node 15 is reached from node 4 (start node).\n\nTherefore, the final path is: 5 -> 17 -> 24 -> 15 -> 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->17->24->15->4."}]
