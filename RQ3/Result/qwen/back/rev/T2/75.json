Start at the given node (start node).\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. Mark the explored nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n4. Move to the next level of nodes (neighbors of the neighbors).\n5. Continue until the target node is found or all nodes have been visited.\n\nLet's apply these steps to our specific graph:\n\n1. Start at node 1.\n2. Explore its neighbors:\n   - Node 1 connects to node 2.\n3. Next, explore the neighbors of node 2:\n   - Node 2 connects to node 4.\n4. Now, explore the neighbors of node 4:\n   - Node 4 connects to node 6.\n5. Next, explore the neighbors of node 6:\n   - Node 6 connects to nodes 0 and 4 (but we've already seen node 4).\n6. Next, explore the neighbors of node 0:\n   - Node 0 connects to nodes 5, 6, and 7 (but we've already seen nodes 6 and 7).\n7. Finally, explore the neighbors of node 5:\n   - Node 5 connects to node 3 (which is our target).\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 is:\n\n1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> 0 -> 5 -> 3\n\nHowever, we can see that there's a shorter path if we go directly from node 1 to node 2 and then directly to node 3 via node 5.
