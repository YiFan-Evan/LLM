Since all the edges in the given graph do not have weights and are considered equal, BFS is sufficient for finding the shortest path.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of how BFS works:\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore its neighbors.\n3. Add those neighbors to a queue and mark them as visited.\n4. Move to the next node in the queue and repeat the process until you reach the target node.\n5. Track the path by storing the parent of each node during the traversal.\n\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [2]\n   - Visited: {2}\n   - Parent: {2: None}\n\n2. **Dequeue 2**:\n   - Neighbors: [7, 4]\n   - Add neighbors to queue: [7, 4]\n   - Mark as visited: {2, 7, 4}\n   - Update parent: {2: None, 7: 2, 4: 2}\n\n3. **Dequeue 7**:\n   - Neighbors: [8, 8] (Already visited)\n   - Add no new neighbors.\n   - Mark as visited: {2, 7, 4, 8}\n   - Update parent: {2: None, 7: 2, 4: 2, 8: 7}\n\n4. **Dequeue 4**:\n   - Neighbors: [5, 12]\n   - Add neighbors to queue: [5, 12]\n   - Mark as visited: {2, 7, 4, 8, 5, 12}\n   - Update parent: {2: None, 7: 2, 4: 2, 8: 7, 5: 4, 12: 4}\n\nSince we reached the target node 8, we now trace back the path using the parent dictionary:\n- 8 -> 7 -> 2\n\n### Final Path:\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 2 to node 8 is: 2->7->8"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 9], [1, 10], [2, 7], [2, 4], [3, 12], [4, 5], [4, 12], [6, 13], [6, 8], [7, 8], [10, 11], [11, 14], [12, 14]]} The start node: 8 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 8 to node 2, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is particularly suitable for unweighted graphs like this one because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time a node is visited, it is via the shortest path.\n\n### Steps of BFS:\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (8).\n2. Use a visited set to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. Use a parent dictionary to record the path taken to reach each node.\n4. Dequeue nodes and enqueue their unvisited neighbors while updating the parent dictionary.\n5.
