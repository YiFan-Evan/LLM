However, since this is an unweighted graph (meaning all edges have the same weight), we can also use Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is simpler and more efficient for such cases.\n\nHere are the steps we'll follow using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start by marking the start node as visited and enqueue it.\n2. **Process Queue**: Dequeue a node and check if it's the target node. If yes, stop and trace back the path. If not, enqueue all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet.\n3. **Repeat**: Repeat step 2 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n- Edges: [[0, 2], [0, 8], [0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 10], [4, 9], [4, 6], [5, 14], [6, 12], [6, 14], [7, 8], [8, 10], [9, 11], [9, 13]]\n- Start Node: 4\n- Destination: 10\n\n**BFS Execution:**\n\n1.
