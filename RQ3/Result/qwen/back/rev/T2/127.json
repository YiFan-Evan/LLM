Here, since there are no weights mentioned for the edges, BFS is an appropriate choice because it explores vertices in increasing order of their distance from the starting vertex.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize**: Start from the source node (node 10) and mark it as visited.\n2. **Explore Neighbors**: For each neighbor of the current node, if it hasn't been visited yet, add it to a queue and mark it as visited.\n3. **Track Path**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Destination Check**: Stop when you reach the destination node (node 6).\n\n### Applying BFS:\n\n1. Start at node 10.\n2. Explore its neighbors (nodes 8 and 11).\n   - Mark node 8 as visited and add it to the queue.\n   - Mark node 11 as visited and add it to the queue.\n3. Next, explore node 8.\n   - Node 8 has neighbors 2 and 10 (but 10 is already visited).\n   - Mark node 2 as visited and add it to the queue.\n4.
