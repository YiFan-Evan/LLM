Since the graph provided does not specify any weights, we'll assume it's unweighted and use BFS for simplicity.\n\nHere\u2019s a step-by-step approach using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the given start node (5) and initialize a queue for BFS. Use a dictionary to keep track of the distance from the start node to each node and another dictionary to store the parent of each node, which helps in reconstructing the path.\n\n2. **Queue Operations**: Enqueue the start node (5) into the queue and set its distance to 0. Mark it as visited.\n\n3. **Processing Nodes**: While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node. For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited yet, mark it as visited, update its distance, set its parent to the current node, and enqueue it.\n\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the destination node (6) is reached, trace back from the destination node to the start node using the parent pointers to get the shortest path.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\n\n- **Nodes**: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n- **Edges**: [[0, 4], [1, 6], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 6], [3, 4], [4, 7]]\n- **Start Node**: 5\n- **Destination Node**: 6\n\n**Step-by-Step BFS Execution**:\n1.
