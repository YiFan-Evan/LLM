Given that all edges in the provided graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it guarantees to find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore all its neighbors.\n3. Then explore all the neighbors of those neighbors.\n4. Continue until you reach the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. Start at node 5.\n2. From node 5, explore its neighbors: 13 and 18.\n3. From node 13, explore its neighbors: 19 and 21.\n4. From node 18, explore its neighbors: 15, 22, and 24.\n5. From node 15, explore its neighbors: 8, 16, and 24.\n6.

BFS is ideal for this task because it explores all the vertices level by level, ensuring that the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) is found.\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step process using BFS:\n\n1. **Start at node 8**.\n2. **Explore all direct neighbors of node 8**: These are nodes 15, 16, and 24.\n3. **From these neighbors, explore their neighbors**:\n   - From node 15: Nodes 9 and 6 (and also 8, but we already visited it).\n   - From node 16: Node 3.\n   - From node 24: No new nodes since it\u2019s not connected to any other nodes not already visited.\n\n4. **Continue exploring**:\n   - From node 9: No new nodes.\n   - From node 6: Node 15 (already visited), so no new nodes.\n   - From node 3: Nodes 11 and 16 (both already visited).\n\n5. **Continue exploring further levels**:\n   - From node 11: Node 10 (new node).\n   - From node 10: No new nodes.\n   - From node 16: No new nodes.\n   - From node 11: No new nodes.\n   - From node 16: No new nodes.\n\n6. **Finally, from node 13 (which is a neighbor of node 5)**:\n   - From node 13: Nodes 5 and 19.\n\nSince we are looking for the shortest path to node 5, we need to trace back the steps to see how we get there.\n\nFollowing the path backward:\n- Node 5 is connected to node 13.\n- Node 13 can be reached from node 18.\n- Node 18 can be reached from node 8.\n\nSo, the shortest path from node 8 to node 5 is: 8->18->13->5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->18->13->5"}]
