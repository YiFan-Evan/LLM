Since all the edges in the provided graph are unweighted, BFS is an efficient choice because it explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time we reach the destination node, it is via the shortest path.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works for this problem:\n1. Start at the given start node (node 5).\n2. Explore all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n4. Continue until you reach the destination node (node 7).\n\nLet's trace the BFS steps:\n\n1. Start at node 5.\n2. From node 5, visit its neighbors (nodes 12).\n3. From node 12, visit its neighbors (nodes 8, 16, 5). Note that 5 is already visited.\n4. From node 8, visit its neighbors (nodes 0, 12, 16). Nodes 12 and 8 are already visited.\n5. From node 16, visit its neighbors (nodes 8, 14, 17). Nodes 8 and 16 are already visited.\n6. From node 14, visit its neighbors (nodes 2, 13, 16, 23). Nodes 16 and 14 are already visited.\n7. From node 17, visit its neighbors (nodes 0, 15, 24). Node 17 is not connected to the target node 7 directly or indirectly.\n8. From node 12, revisit its neighbors (nodes 5, 8, 16). Already visited.\n9. From node 9, visit its neighbors (nodes 4, 21). Node 9 is not connected to the target node 7 directly or indirectly.\n10. From node 21, visit its neighbors (nodes 3, 11, 9, 22). Node 21 is not connected to the target node 7 directly or indirectly.\n11. From node 22, visit its neighbors (nodes 7, 15). Node 7 is the target node.\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 5 to node 7 is through nodes 5 -> 12 -> 8 -> 16 -> 14 -> 23 -> 22 -> 7.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->12->8->16->14->23->22->7"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 8], [0, 17], [1, 15], [2, 14], [3, 18], [3, 20], [3, 23], [4, 9], [4, 5], [5, 12], [6, 19], [6, 24], [7, 22], [7, 21], [8, 12], [8, 16], [9, 21], [10, 23], [11, 21], [13, 23], [14, 23], [14, 16], [15, 22], [17, 24]]} The start node: 7 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 7 to node 5 in the given graph, we can again use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
