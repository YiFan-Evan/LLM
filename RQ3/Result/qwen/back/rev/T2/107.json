BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph since it explores all the vertices level by level, ensuring that the first time a vertex is visited, it is via the shortest path from the starting node.\n\n### Steps for BFS:\n1. Start from the initial node (node 0).\n2. Visit all the neighbors of the current node.\n3. Mark the neighbors as visited and record their parent nodes.\n4. Move to the next level of nodes (neighbors of the neighbors).\n5. Repeat until the target node (node 9) is found.\n6. Trace back the path from the target node to the start node using the recorded parent nodes.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n1. **Start at node 0**:\n   - Neighbors: Node 6.\n   \n2. **Explore neighbors of node 6**:\n   - Neighbors: Node 10.\n   \n3. **Explore neighbors of node 10**:\n   - Neighbors: Nodes 4, 6, and 8.\n   - Node 6 has already been visited.\n   - Node 4 and 8 are new nodes.\n\n4. **Explore neighbors of node 8**:\n   - Neighbors: Node 10.\n   - Node 10 has already been visited.\n   \n5. **Explore neighbors of node 4**:\n   - No further neighbors to explore.\n\n6. **Explore neighbors of node 9**:\n   - Neighbors: Node 10 and Node 1.\n   - Node 10 has already been visited.\n   - Node 1 is a new node.\n\n7. **Explore neighbors of node 1**:\n   - Neighbors: Node 2 and Node 11.\n   - Nodes 2 and 11 are new nodes.\n\n8. **Explore neighbors of node 2**:\n   - Neighbor: Node 3.\n   - Node 3 is a new node.\n\n9. **Explore neighbors of node 3**:\n   - No further neighbors to explore.\n\n10. **Explore neighbors of node 11**:\n    - No further neighbors to explore.\n\n11. **Explore neighbors of node 2**:\n    - No further neighbors to explore.\n\n12. **Explore neighbors of node 9**:\n    - Node 9 is our target node, and it is connected to Node 10, which we have already visited.\n\nNow, tracing back the path from node 9 to node 0 using the parent nodes:\n- Node 9 is directly connected to node 10.\n- Node 10 is connected to node 6.\n- Node 6 is connected to node 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->6->10->9."}]
