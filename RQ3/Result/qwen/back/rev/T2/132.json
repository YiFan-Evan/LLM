In this scenario, since all the edges have equal weight (no distinction between different weights), BFS is a suitable choice because it efficiently finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the initial node.\n2. Explore its neighbors.\n3. Then explore the neighbors of those neighbors.\n4.
