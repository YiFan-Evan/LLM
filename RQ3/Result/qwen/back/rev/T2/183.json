Since all edges in this graph are unweighted, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere\u2019s how BFS works:\n1. Start at the given initial node.\n2. Explore its neighbors.\n3. Add those neighbors to a queue.\n4.
