Insertion sort works by dividing the input array into a sorted part and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part contains only the first element, and the unsorted part contains the rest. The algorithm repeatedly takes one element from the unsorted part and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted part.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this algorithm using loop invariants, we need to identify a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner while loop. This condition should help us understand that after the loop completes, the array up to the current position is sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner While Loop\n\nFor the inner while loop:\n```python\nwhile z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n    temp = arr[z]\n    arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n    arr[z - 1] = temp\n    z -= 1\n```\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nThe elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nFormally, we can write this as:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z])\n```\nHere, the function `fun` implies that the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` is sorted.\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization:** Before the loop starts, the value of `z` is set to `i`, which means initially, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` is considered.\n- **Maintenance:** During each iteration of the loop, if `arr[z - 1]` is greater than `arr[z]`, the elements are swapped, and `z` is decremented. This ensures that after each swap, the subarray remains sorted.\n- **Termination:** When the loop terminates (i.e., when `z` is no longer greater than 0 or `arr[z - 1]` is not greater than `arr[z]`), the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = -1\n    while k < len(arr) - 1:\n        k += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles Involved\n\nThe provided code is an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. Insertion sort works by building a sorted portion of the array one element at a time. The outer loop iterates through each element of the array, and the inner loop ensures that the element being processed is placed in its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this algorithm using loop invariants, we need to identify conditions that hold true before and after each iteration of the loops. Specifically, we need to ensure that after the loop completes, the array up to the current position is sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Outer While Loop\n\nThe outer while loop runs from `k = -1` to `k < len(arr) - 1`. For each iteration of the outer loop, the invariant should reflect that the first `k+1` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nThe elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[k]` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nFormally, we can write this as:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[k])\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner While Loop\n\nThe inner while loop runs as long as `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`. For each iteration of the inner loop, the invariant should reflect that the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` are sorted.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nThe elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nFormally, we can write this as:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z])\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Initialization:** \n  - For the outer loop, when `k = -1`, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[-1]` is empty, which is trivially sorted.\n  - For the inner loop, when `z = i`, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` is initially considered, but the loop will run only if `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`.\n\n- **Maintenance:** \n  - For the outer loop, after each iteration, `k` increases by 1, and the invariant ensures that the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[k]` remains sorted.\n  - For the inner loop, during each iteration, the elements are swapped if necessary, ensuring that the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` remains sorted.\n\n- **Termination:** \n  - For the outer loop, when `k` reaches `len(arr) - 1`, all elements have been processed, and the entire array is sorted.\n  - For the inner loop, when `z` becomes `0` or `arr[z - 1] <= arr[z]`, the loop terminates, ensuring the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[z]` is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nFor the outer while loop:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[k])\n```\n\nFor the inner while loop:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z])\n```"}]
