The key idea behind selection sort is to divide the array into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. In each iteration, the smallest element from the unsorted part is selected and moved to the end of the sorted part.\n\n- **Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop**:\n  - The outer loop runs from `b = 0` to `b < len(arr)`. After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `b` elements are sorted in ascending order.\n  - Therefore, after the i-th iteration, the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[b-1]` are sorted.\n\n- **Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop**:\n  - The inner loop runs from `z = b+1` to `z < len(arr)`. During this loop, we find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array (`arr[b]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]`) and swap it with `arr[b]`.\n  - Therefore, after the j-th iteration of the inner loop, the element `arr[b]` contains the smallest element from `arr[b]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]`.\n\n### Answer\n\nGiven the above principles, the loop invariants can be expressed as follows:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**:\n  - `sorted_value = arr[:b]`\n  - Therefore, the final answer for the outer loop invariant is: `sorted_value = arr[:b]`\n\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**:\n  - `min_value = min(arr[b:z+1])`\n  - Therefore, the final answer for the inner loop invariant is: `min_value = min(arr[b:z+1])`\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nsorted_value = arr[:b]\nmin_value = min(arr[b:z+1])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    b = -1\n    while b < len(arr) - 1:\n        b += 1\n        z = b + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[b]:\n                temp = arr[b]\n                arr[b] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe `selection_sort` function sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm. The algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning of the unsorted part. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**:\n  - The outer loop starts with `b = -1` and increments `b` in each iteration. After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `b+1` elements of the array are sorted in ascending order.\n  - Therefore, after the i-th iteration, the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[b]` are sorted.\n\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**:\n  - The inner loop starts with `z = b + 1` and iterates through the remaining unsorted part of the array. During each iteration of the inner loop, the current minimum element from the unsorted part is identified and swapped with `arr[b]` if it is smaller.\n  - Therefore, after the j-th iteration of the inner loop, the element `arr[b]` contains the smallest element from `arr[b]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]`.\n\n### Answer\n\nBased on the above principles, the loop invariants can be expressed as follows:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**:\n  - `sorted_value = arr[:b+1]`\n  - Therefore, the final answer for the outer loop invariant is: `sorted_value = arr[:b+1]`\n\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**:\n  - `min_value = min(arr[b:z+1])`\n  - Therefore, the final answer for the inner loop invariant is: `min_value = min(arr[b:z+1])`\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nsorted_value = arr[:b+1]\nmin_value = min(arr[b:z+1])\n```"}]
