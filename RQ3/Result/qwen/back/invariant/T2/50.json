The loop invariant should hold true before and after each iteration of the loop and help us prove the partial correctness of the program.\n\n### Fundamental Principles\n\n1. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `k` is initialized to `-1`. This ensures that the first iteration sets `k` to `0`.\n2. **Maintenance**: During each iteration, `k` is incremented by `1`, and if `arr[k]` equals `target`, `count_value` is incremented.\n3. **Termination**: The loop terminates when `k` reaches `len(arr)`, meaning all elements have been checked.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nWe want to ensure that `count_value` always holds the correct count of `target` occurrences up to the current index `k`. Therefore, a suitable loop invariant can be formulated as:\n\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[0:k+1] if x == target)`\n\nThis means that at any point during the execution of the loop (before or after each iteration), the value of `count_value` is equal to the number of elements in the subarray `arr[0:k+1]` (up to the current index `k` inclusive) that are equal to `target`.\n\nSince the problem specifies the invariant in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can reformulate the invariant slightly to fit this format:\n\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[0:k+1] if x == target)`\n\nThis statement indicates that `count_value` is equal to the sum of 1s for every element `x` in the slice of the array from the start up to the current index `k` (inclusive), where `x` equals `target`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[0:k+1] if x == target)`"}]
