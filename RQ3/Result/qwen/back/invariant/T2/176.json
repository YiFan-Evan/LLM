Insertion sort works by dividing the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. With each iteration, it takes one element from the unsorted region and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted region.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this insertion sort algorithm using a loop invariant, we need to identify a statement that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner loop. This loop invariant should help us understand that at any point in time during the execution of the algorithm, the elements up to a certain index are sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant Explanation\n\nFor the inner loop:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])`\n- **Explanation**: At the start of each iteration of the inner loop (which is controlled by `z`), the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[q-1]` is sorted.\n- **Initialization**: Before the first iteration of the inner loop (`z = i`), `arr[0]` to `arr[q-1]` is already sorted because initially `q` is 0 and no elements have been processed yet.\n- **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the inner loop, if `arr[z]` is less than `arr[z-1]`, the two elements are swapped, ensuring that `arr[0]` to `arr[q-1]` remains sorted.\n- **Termination**: When the inner loop ends, `arr[0]` to `arr[q-1]` is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = -1\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:\n        q += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code implements the insertion sort algorithm. Insertion sort works by iterating through the array and inserting each element into its correct position within a sorted sublist. The algorithm maintains a sorted sublist in the lower positions of the array and gradually builds up this sublist by shifting elements as needed.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this algorithm, we need to identify a loop invariant for the outer loop. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For the outer loop in insertion sort, the loop invariant should state that the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[q]` is sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant Explanation\n\nFor the outer loop:\n- **Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q])`\n- **Explanation**: At the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by `q`), the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[q]` is sorted.\n- **Initialization**: Before the first iteration of the outer loop (`q = -1`), the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[-1]` is trivially sorted because it contains no elements.\n- **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the outer loop, the outer loop picks an element `arr[q+1]` and inserts it into its correct position within the sorted sublist `arr[0]` to `arr[q]`. The inner loop ensures that this insertion is done correctly by shifting elements as needed.\n- **Termination**: When the outer loop ends (`q` reaches `len(arr) - 1`), the entire array `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr) - 1]` is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q])`"}]
