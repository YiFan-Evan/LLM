The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The algorithm works by dividing the input array into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part contains only the first element, and the unsorted part contains the rest.\n\nThe outer loop (`while b < len(arr)`) iterates over each element of the array starting from the second element, treating the current element as the key to be inserted into the correct position within the sorted part of the array. The inner loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`) shifts elements in the sorted part of the array to the right until the correct position for the key is found.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this algorithm using a loop invariant, we need to define a statement that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. This statement should help us reason about the state of the array at each step of the sorting process.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the inner loop, the loop invariant should capture the idea that the portion of the array up to the current position `b` is sorted.\n\n- **Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0] -> arr[b-1]` is sorted.\n\nGiven that the inner loop modifies the array by shifting elements to make room for the key element, the loop invariant must reflect that the subarray up to `b-1` is always sorted before any changes are made to place the key in its correct position.\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n- **Loop Invariant for the inner loop**:\n  - `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[b-1])`\n  - where `fun` can be defined as a predicate that checks if the elements from index 0 to `b-1` are sorted.\n  \nSince we're asked to write the invariant in the specific format, we can represent it as:\n\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[b-1])`\n\nThis captures the essence that the portion of the array up to the current boundary `b-1` is sorted. However, since the question specifically asks for the invariant in terms of the inner loop and given the format constraint, we can generalize it as follows:\n\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z-1])` \n\nThis represents that up to the current position `z-1`, the array is sorted. Given the format requested, we would adjust it slightly to match the exact format:\n\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z-1])` \n\nHowever, to fit exactly with the format provided, we might consider:\n\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z-1])`\n\nBut the most appropriate and clear representation fitting the format would be:\n\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z-1])`\n\nThis ensures the invariant is correctly captured for the inner loop's iterations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = -1\n    while b < len(arr) - 1:\n        b += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe given Python function `insertion_sort` implements the insertion sort algorithm, which sorts an array in ascending order.
