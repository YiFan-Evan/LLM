This algorithm works by dividing the input array into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. Initially, the sorted portion consists of just the first element, and the unsorted portion consists of the remaining elements. In each iteration of the outer loop, the algorithm takes the first element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into its correct position within the sorted portion.\n\n- **Outer Loop**: Iterates over each element in the array starting from index `0` to the end.\n- **Inner Loop**: Ensures that the element at the current position `z` is moved to its correct position within the sorted part of the array by comparing it with the preceding elements and swapping if necessary.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to establish a loop invariant for the outer loop, which is responsible for moving elements from the unsorted portion to the sorted portion of the array.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, a suitable loop invariant could be:\n\n- At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (when `i` equals the current value), the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` is sorted.\n\nFormally, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n- `sorted_part_length = i`\n\nThis means that up to the i-th iteration, the length of the sorted part of the array (`arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`) is equal to `i`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_part_length = i`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        i += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nThe given code is an implementation of the **Insertion Sort** algorithm. Insertion sort works by iterating through the array and inserting each element into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.\n\n- **Initialization**: The variable `i` starts at `-1`, meaning before the first iteration of the outer loop, no elements are considered part of the sorted portion.\n- **Outer Loop**: Iterates from `i = 0` to `i = len(arr) - 1`. During each iteration, the current element `arr[i]` is considered and inserted into the correct position within the sorted portion of the array.\n- **Inner Loop**: For each `i`, the inner loop moves elements in the sorted portion to make space for `arr[i]` if they are greater than `arr[i]`.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to establish a loop invariant for the outer loop. The loop invariant should hold true before and after each iteration of the loop and help us understand the state of the array during the sorting process.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, a suitable loop invariant is:\n\n- The subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` is sorted.\n\nFormally, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:i]`\n\nThis means that up to the i-th iteration, the subarray from the beginning of the array up to the element just before `arr[i]` is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = arr[0:i]`"}]
