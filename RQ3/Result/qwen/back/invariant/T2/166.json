The main loop iterates over the array elements from left to right. For each element, it places the element in its correct position among the already sorted elements to its left.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to identify a loop invariant for the inner while loop. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For insertion sort, a suitable loop invariant would be that the subarray from the start up to the current index (exclusive) is sorted.\n\nHowever, the provided code has some issues:\n1. The variable `i` is not defined.\n2. The variable `z` is initialized with `i`, which is undefined, so it needs to be initialized correctly.\n\nAssuming `i` should be `g` (the outer loop variable), the loop invariant can be described as follows:\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the inner while loop:\n- The subarray `arr[0] -> arr[g-1]` is sorted.\n\nGiven these points, we can now write the loop invariant in the required format.\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g-1])\n``` \n\nHere, `fun` represents the fact that the subarray from `0` to `g-1` is sorted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = -1\n    while g < len(arr) - 1:\n        g += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles Involved\n\nThe provided code is an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.
