The key idea behind insertion sort is to iterate through the array, treating each element as a new item to insert into the sorted portion of the array that comes before it.\n\nIn this specific code:\n- `p` iterates over each element of the array.\n- For each `p`, we use another inner loop to compare and swap elements if they are out of order, ensuring that the sub-array from the start up to the current position `p` is sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the algorithm using loop invariants, we need to identify a condition that holds true at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop.\n\nFor the outer loop, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\n\n- **Loop Invariant:** At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop (`p = i`), the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Formalizing the Loop Invariant\n\nLet's formalize this loop invariant in the requested format:\n\n- **Invariant Statement:** `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:p]->arr[0:p])`\n- **Function Definition:** `fun(arr[0:p]->arr[0:p])` means that the subarray `arr[0:p]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0:p]->arr[0:p])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = -1\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        p += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code is an attempt at implementing the Insertion Sort algorithm. The core principle of insertion sort is to divide the array into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. During each iteration, the algorithm takes the first element of the unsorted portion and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted portion.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the steps:\n1. Initialize `p` to `-1`.\n2. Increment `p` in each iteration of the outer loop, moving through the array.\n3. Use an inner loop to ensure that the subarray `arr[0:p+1]` is sorted by comparing and swapping elements as necessary.\n\n### Identifying the Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, the loop invariant needs to capture the state of the array at the beginning of each iteration. Specifically, the invariant should state that the subarray `arr[0:p+1]` is sorted after the completion of the previous iteration.\n\n### Formulating the Loop Invariant\n\nGiven the requirement to express the invariant in the format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can formulate it as follows:\n\n- **Invariant Statement:** `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:p+1]->arr[0:p+1])`\n- **Function Definition:** `fun(arr[0:p+1]->arr[0:p+1])` means that the subarray `arr[0:p+1]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0:p+1]->arr[0:p+1])\n```"}]
