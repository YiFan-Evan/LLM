The fundamental principle behind this sort is that after each iteration of the outer loop, the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array is moved to its correct position in the sorted portion.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nWe need to identify a loop invariant for the outer loop, which iterates through the array, and the inner loop, which finds the minimum element in the remaining unsorted part of the array.\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\nThe outer loop runs from `q = 0` to `q < len(arr)`. After each iteration of the outer loop, the first `q` elements are sorted and in their correct positions.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])`\n\nThis means that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop (`q = i`), the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[q-1]` are sorted.\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\nThe inner loop runs from `z = q+1` to `z < len(arr)` and is responsible for finding the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array starting from index `q`.\n\nAfter each iteration of the inner loop, the minimum element in the subarray `arr[q+1]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]` is known and ready to be swapped with `arr[q]` if necessary.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- `min_value = fun(arr[q+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\n\nThis means that after the j-th iteration of the inner loop (`z = j`), the minimum element among `arr[q+1]` to `arr[z-1]` is known.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])`\n- `min_value = fun(arr[q+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    q = -1\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:\n        q += 1\n        z = q + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[q]:\n                temp = arr[q]\n                arr[q] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nThe provided code implements the Selection Sort algorithm. The outer loop starts with `q = -1` and increments `q` until `q` reaches `len(arr) - 1`. For each value of `q`, the inner loop searches for the minimum element in the subarray `arr[q+1]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]` and swaps it with `arr[q]` if necessary. This ensures that after each iteration of the outer loop, the first `q+1` elements are sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to establish a loop invariant for the outer loop.\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nAfter the i-th iteration of the outer loop (`q = i`), the first `i+1` elements of the array are sorted in ascending order.\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\n\nThis means that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` are sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q])`"}]
