Insertion sort works by iterating through the array and growing a sorted section at the beginning of the list.

Insertion sort works by dividing the array into a sorted part and an unsorted part. It iterates over the unsorted part, taking one element at a time and inserting it into the correct position within the sorted part.\n\n### Fundamental Principles\n\n1. **Loop Invariant**: A condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For proving the correctness of the insertion sort, the invariant typically states that the subarray `arr[0:j]` is sorted after the j-th iteration of the outer loop.\n2. **Partial Correctness**: The program behaves correctly for all valid inputs up until the point where the loop terminates.\n\n### Analysis\n\n- **Outer Loop (`while j < len(arr) - 1`)**:\n  - The outer loop starts with `j = -1` and increments `j` by 1 in each iteration.\n  - The loop continues until `j` reaches `len(arr) - 1`, meaning the entire array is processed.\n  - The invariant for the outer loop should state that the subarray `arr[0:j+1]` is sorted after the j-th iteration.\n\n- **Inner Loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`)**:\n  - The inner loop runs from `z = j` down to `1`.\n  - The inner loop ensures that the element at index `z` is placed in its correct position within the sorted part `arr[0:j]`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `j = i - 1`):\n\n- The subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\n\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr[0:j+1]_value = fun(arr[0:j+1] -> arr[0:j+1]) where fun ensures that the subarray arr[0:j+1] is sorted.\n```\n\nIn the context of the i-th iteration, this translates to:\n\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr[0:j+1]_value = fun(arr[0:j+1] -> arr[0:j+1]) where j = i - 1.\n```\n\nThis invariant means that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted."}]
