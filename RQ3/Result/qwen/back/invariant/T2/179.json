Insertion sort works by dividing the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. The sorted region starts with the first element, and with each iteration, one element from the unsorted region is placed into its correct position within the sorted region.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to establish a loop invariant for the outer while loop. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\nFor the outer while loop:\n- At the start of each iteration, the first `t` elements of the array are sorted.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as: \n  `sorted_value = fun(arr[:t] -> arr[:t])`, where `fun` represents that the subarray `arr[:t]` is sorted.\n\nFor the inner while loop:\n- The inner loop runs when `z` is greater than 0 and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`.\n- It swaps elements until the correct position for `arr[t]` is found within the sorted portion of the array.\n- Therefore, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n  `sorted_and_in_place_value = fun(arr[:z+1] -> arr[:z+1])`, where `fun` represents that the subarray `arr[:z+1]` is sorted and the element at index `z` is in its correct place within the sorted portion.\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = fun(arr[:t] -> arr[:t])`\n- For the inner loop: `sorted_and_in_place_value = fun(arr[:z+1] -> arr[:z+1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    t = -1\n    while t < len(arr) - 1:\n        t += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nThe provided code is an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. The goal is to prove the partial correctness of the program by finding a loop invariant for the outer while loop.\n\nThe outer while loop iterates through the array, and for each element, it places it in its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array. The key here is to define a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Outer While Loop\n\nAt the beginning of each iteration of the outer while loop, the first `t` elements of the array are sorted.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[:t+1] -> arr[:t+1])`, where `fun` represents that the subarray `arr[:t+1]` is sorted.\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[:t+1] -> arr[:t+1])`"}]
