[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This loop invariant should help us understand why the algorithm will correctly identify the minimum value in the array.\n\nThe loop invariant for this program should capture the fact that the variable `min_value` always contains the smallest value found so far in the array from the start up to the current index `g`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nBefore each iteration of the loop, the value of `min_value` is the minimum value found in the array from the beginning up to the index `g-1`. Therefore, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n`min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[g-1])`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[g-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    g = -1\n    while g < len(arr) - 1:\n        g += 1\n        if arr[g] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[g]\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the `find_min` function, we need to establish a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.

Since `g` starts at `-1` and increments by 1 at the beginning of each iteration, `g` will be the current index being examined in the array during the iteration. Hence, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n`min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[g])`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[g])`"}]
