Insertion Sort works by dividing the array into a sorted part and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part consists of the first element, and the unsorted part consists of the rest of the elements. In each iteration, the algorithm takes the first element from the unsorted part and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted part.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this algorithm using loop invariants, we need to establish a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner loop. This condition should help us understand the state of the array at any point during the sorting process.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop\n\nThe inner loop starts with `z` initialized to `r` and continues as long as `z` is greater than 0 and the element at `z-1` is greater than the element at `z`. During each iteration, the elements are swapped if they are out of order, and `z` is decremented. \n\nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as follows:\n- **Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0->z]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop\n\nThe outer loop increments `r` in each iteration, which means it progressively increases the size of the sorted portion of the array. The loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as follows:\n- **Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0->r-1]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nGiven the structure of the code, the variable `i` is not defined within the scope of the function, so we assume it was meant to be `r`. Therefore, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be expressed as:\n\n**Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop**:\n- **Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0->r-1]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nSince `r` starts from 0 and increments until it reaches the length of the array, by the end of the loop, the entire array will be sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0->r-1])`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0->z])`\n\nWhere `fun(arr[0->r-1])` and `fun(arr[0->z])` represent the fact that the subarrays are sorted in non-decreasing order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nThe provided code is an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm. The fundamental principle of Insertion Sort is to sort the array by maintaining a sorted section at the beginning of the array and gradually extending this sorted section one element at a time. \n\nThe outer loop (`while r < len(arr) - 1`) iterates through the array, and in each iteration, it increments `r` and initializes `z` to `r`. The inner loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`) ensures that the elements are correctly positioned within the sorted section of the array.\n\n### Loop Invariants\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nThe outer loop iterates from `r = -1` to `len(arr) - 2`. At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0 -> r]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n- **Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0->r]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nThe inner loop moves the element at index `r` to its correct position within the sorted section of the array. It swaps elements as necessary to ensure that the elements up to `z` are in sorted order.\n\n- **Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0->z]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0->r])`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0->z])`\n\nWhere `fun(arr[0->r])` and `fun(arr[0->z])` represent the fact that the subarrays are sorted in non-decreasing order."}]
