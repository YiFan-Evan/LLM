In this algorithm, for each position in the array, we find the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array and swap it with the element at the current position.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the algorithm, we need to identify a loop invariant for the outer loop, which iterates over the array positions from `j = 0` to `len(arr) - 1`. \n\nA loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For the selection sort algorithm, a suitable loop invariant would be that the subarray from the start up to the current index `j-1` (inclusive) is sorted and contains the smallest elements found so far.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nGiven the nature of the selection sort algorithm, we can state the loop invariant as follows:\n\n- At the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `j = i`), the subarray `arr[0] -> arr[j-1]` contains the smallest elements found so far and is sorted.\n\nThis can be written in the requested format as:\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\n```\narr[0:j]_value = sorted(arr[0:j])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        j += 1\n        z = j + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[j]:\n                temp = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles Involved\n\nThe `selection_sort` function sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm. In each iteration of the outer loop, the algorithm selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the beginning of the unsorted part.\n\nThe outer loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = len(arr) - 2`, ensuring that each element is considered as the starting point for finding the minimum value in the subsequent unsorted part of the array. The inner loop (`while z < len(arr)`) finds the smallest element in the unsorted part and swaps it with the element at the current starting position `j`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, a suitable loop invariant is that after the i-th iteration (i.e., when `j = i`), the subarray `arr[0] -> arr[i-1]` contains the smallest `i` elements from the original array, and these elements are sorted.\n\nThis can be written in the requested format as:\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\n```\narr[0:j]_value = sorted(arr[0:j])\n```"}]
