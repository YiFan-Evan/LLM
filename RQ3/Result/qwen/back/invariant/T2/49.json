The subarray `arr[0] -> arr[j]` is empty, so `count_value` is correctly initialized to `0`.\n2. **Maintenance**: During each iteration, `j` is incremented by `1`, and if `arr[j]` equals `target`, `count_value` is incremented. This ensures that `count_value` always reflects the count of elements equal to `target` in the subarray `arr[0] -> arr[j]`.\n3. **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `j` equals `len(arr) - 1`, which means `j` has traversed the entire array.
