Insertion sort works by iterating through the array and growing a sorted portion of the array one element at a time. For each element, it checks if the current element is smaller than the previous elements and swaps them accordingly until the correct position is found.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program using a loop invariant, we need to identify a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner loop. \n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop\n\nThe inner loop iterates over the elements from index `i` down to `0` to place the element at index `i` in its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** \n- At the start of each iteration of the inner loop (when `z` equals `i`), the subarray `arr[0] -> arr[i-1]` is sorted.\n- Therefore, the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` are in non-decreasing order.\n\nFormally, we can express this loop invariant as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:i])`\n- Here, `fun` would be a function that indicates the array segment is sorted.\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:i])` where `fun` indicates that the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = -1\n    while o < len(arr) - 1:\n        o += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code implements the Insertion Sort algorithm. Insertion sort works by dividing the array into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. Initially, the sorted portion contains only the first element, and with each iteration, the next element from the unsorted portion is inserted into its correct position within the sorted portion.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to identify a loop invariant for the outer loop. The loop invariant should hold true before and after each iteration of the loop and help us understand why the algorithm produces a correctly sorted array.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop\n\nThe outer loop runs from `o = -1` to `len(arr) - 2`. After each iteration of the outer loop, the first `o + 1` elements of the array (`arr[0]` to `arr[o]`) are sorted.\n\nFormally, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:o+1])`\n- Here, `fun` indicates that the subarray `arr[0:o+1]` is sorted.\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:o+1])` where `fun` indicates that the subarray `arr[0:o+1]` is sorted."}]
