[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This ensures that `max_value` has a valid starting point.\n2. **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the loop, if the current element (`arr[r]`) is greater than the current `max_value`, `max_value` is updated to this new value. This ensures that `max_value` always contains the highest value seen up to the current index `r`.\n3. **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `r` equals the length of the array.
