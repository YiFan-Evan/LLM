This algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. The outer loop (`while m < len(arr)`) iterates over each position in the array where the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array will be placed.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to identify a loop invariant for the outer loop. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, a suitable loop invariant would be:\n- The first `m` elements of the array are sorted.\n- These first `m` elements are also the smallest `m` elements in the entire array.\n\nFormally, we can express this invariant as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[:m]`\n- `smallest_value = arr[:m]`\n\nHowever, since the question asks for a specific format, we can state the invariant as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[:m]`\n- `smallest_value = arr[:m]`\n\nSince the question specifically asks for the invariant in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can rephrase it as:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[:m]`\n- `smallest_value = arr[:m]`\n\nSince both expressions are essentially the same, we can combine them into one statement for simplicity:\n\n- `sorted_smallest_value = arr[:m]`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_smallest_value = arr[:m]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    m = -1\n    while m < len(arr) - 1:\n        m += 1\n        z = m + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[m]:\n                temp = arr[m]\n                arr[m] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles Involved\n\nThe `selection_sort` function sorts an array using the Selection Sort algorithm.
