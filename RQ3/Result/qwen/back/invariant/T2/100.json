The loop iterates over the array elements until it reaches the index specified by `id`. Once the loop reaches this index, it assigns the value at this index to `member_value`.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to identify a loop invariant. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the given function `give_member`, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\n\nBefore the i-th iteration of the loop, `member_value` contains the value of the element at the index `id` if the loop has already encountered index `id`, otherwise `member_value` remains `-1`.\n\nThis can be formally written as:\n\n- If `a` (the loop variable) is less than `id`, then `member_value = -1`.\n- If `a` equals or exceeds `id`, then `member_value` holds the value of `arr[id]`.\n\nThus, the loop invariant in the required format is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `member_value = fun(arr[0->a-1])` where `fun` represents that `member_value` remains `-1` unless `a` reaches or exceeds `id`, in which case `member_value` is set to `arr[id]`. However, since the format strictly requires a single expression, the most accurate representation within the constraints would be:\n\n`member_value = fun(arr[0->a-1])` where `fun` implies that `member_value` is `-1` until `a` equals `id`, at which point it captures `arr[id]`. For strict adherence to the format provided:\n\n`member_value = fun(arr[0->a-1])` \n\nHere, `fun` is implicitly understood to represent the described behavior."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    a = -1\n    while a < len(arr) - 1:\n        a += 1\n        if a == id:\n            member_value = arr[a]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nThe given function `give_member` aims to find and return the value of the element at a specific index `id` in the array `arr`.
