This invariant should help us understand why the algorithm works correctly.\n\n### Fundamental Principles\n\n1. **Loop Invariant**: A loop invariant is a condition that is assumed to be true before and after each iteration of a loop. It helps in proving the correctness of the loop.\n2. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, the invariant must hold true.\n3. **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the loop, the invariant must remain true.\n4. **Termination**: When the loop terminates, the invariant combined with the reason for termination should imply the correctness of the result.\n\n### Analysis of the `find_max` Function\n\n- **Initialization**: Before entering the loop, `max_value` is set to `arr[0]`. Therefore, `max_value` initially contains the maximum value of the sub-array `arr[0:1]`.\n- **Maintenance**: During each iteration, if `arr[n]` is greater than `max_value`, `max_value` is updated to `arr[n]`. This means that at any point during the loop, `max_value` holds the maximum value found so far in the array up to the current index `n`.\n- **Termination**: The loop runs until `n` equals `len(arr)`. At this point, `max_value` will hold the maximum value of the entire array.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nBased on the above analysis, a suitable loop invariant can be formulated as:\n\n- `max_value = max(arr[0:n+1])`\n\nThis invariant states that `max_value` is the maximum value of the sub-array from the start of the array up to the current index `n`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n`max_value = max(arr[0:n+1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        if arr[n] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[n]\n    return max_value\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prove the partial correctness of the given `find_max` function, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.
