Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging (swapping) it with the leftmost unsorted element (putting it in sorted order), and moving the sublist boundaries one element to the right.\n\n### Analysis of Loop Invariant\n\nTo find the loop invariant for the given selection sort algorithm, we need to identify what remains true before and after each iteration of the inner and outer loops.\n\n#### Outer Loop (while p < len(arr))\n\n- **Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:p]` contains the p smallest elements in their sorted order, and these elements are in their correct positions.\n- **Formal Statement:** `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:p])`\n\nHere, `fun` can be any function that captures the fact that the elements in `arr[0:p]` are the smallest p elements and are in sorted order. For simplicity, we can say:\n\n`sorted_value = arr[0:p] == sorted(arr[0:p])`\n\nHowever, since we are asked to use a specific format, let's define the function as returning a tuple indicating the sorted nature and the elements themselves.\n\nSo, the invariant becomes:\n\n`sorted_value = (True, arr[0:p])`\n\n#### Inner Loop (while z < len(arr))\n\n- **Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the element `arr[p]` is the smallest element in the subarray `arr[p+1:len(arr)]`.\n- **Formal Statement:** `smallest_value = fun(arr[p+1:len(arr)])`\n\nHere, the function `fun` should indicate that `arr[p]` is the smallest element among `arr[p+1:len(arr)]`.\n\nSince we need to indicate that `arr[p]` is the smallest, we can define the function as follows:\n\n`smallest_value = min(arr[p+1:len(arr)]) == arr[p]`\n\nAgain, using the required format:\n\n`smallest_value = arr[p] == min(arr[p+1:len(arr)])`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_value = (True, arr[0:p])\nsmallest_value = arr[p] == min(arr[p+1:len(arr)])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    p = -1\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        p += 1\n        z = p + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[p]:\n                temp = arr[p]\n                arr[p] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe selection sort algorithm aims to sort an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The outer loop selects the position for the next smallest element, and the inner loop finds the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array.\n\n### Analysis of Loop Invariant\n\nWe need to determine the loop invariant for both the outer and inner loops to prove the partial correctness of the selection sort algorithm.\n\n#### Outer Loop (while p < len(arr) - 1)\n\n- **Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:p]` contains the p smallest elements in their sorted order, and these elements are in their correct positions.\n- **Formal Statement:** `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:p])`\n\nGiven that the elements in `arr[0:p]` should be sorted and in their correct positions, we can express this as:\n\n`sorted_value = (True, arr[0:p])`\n\nThis means that the subarray `arr[0:p]` is sorted and the elements are in their correct positions.\n\n#### Inner Loop (while z < len(arr))\n\n- **Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the element `arr[p]` is the smallest element in the subarray `arr[p+1:len(arr)]`.\n- **Formal Statement:** `smallest_value = fun(arr[p], arr[p+1:len(arr)])`\n\nGiven that `arr[p]` should be the smallest element in the subarray `arr[p+1:len(arr)]`, we can express this as:\n\n`smallest_value = arr[p] <= min(arr[p+1:len(arr)])`\n\nThis means that `arr[p]` is less than or equal to the smallest element in the subarray `arr[p+1:len(arr)]`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_value = (True, arr[0:p])\nsmallest_value = arr[p] <= min(arr[p+1:len(arr)])\n```"}]
