In each iteration of the outer loop, the algorithm ensures that the first `f` elements are sorted and in their correct positions.\n\n### Analysis of Loop Invariant\n\nWe need to identify a loop invariant for the outer while loop. The loop invariant should hold true before and after each iteration of the loop and should help us prove the correctness of the algorithm.\n\nFor the outer loop:\n- **Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[f-1]` contains the smallest `f` elements from the original array, and these elements are sorted.\n\nTo formalize this invariant, we can say that the value of the elements in the range `arr[0]` to `arr[f-1]` is the same as the value of the smallest `f` elements in the original array, but now they are sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant Formulation\n\nThe loop invariant can be formulated as:\n- `sorted_value = min(arr[0]->arr[f-1])`\n\nHowever, since we want to use the format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can express it as:\n- `sorted_value = min(arr[0]->arr[f-1])`\n\nSince the elements in `arr[0]` to `arr[f-1]` are already sorted, we can also say:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0]`\n\nBut for consistency with the problem's format, we'll stick to the more general form.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = min(arr[0]->arr[f-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    f = -1\n    while f < len(arr) - 1:\n        f += 1\n        z = f + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[f]:\n                temp = arr[f]\n                arr[f] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe Selection Sort algorithm works by dividing the array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. In each iteration of the outer loop, the algorithm selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and places it at the end of the sorted part. \n\n### Analysis of Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop:\n- **Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[f]` contains the smallest `f+1` elements from the original array, and these elements are sorted.\n\nThis means that after `f` iterations, the first `f+1` elements of the array are sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Loop Invariant Formulation\n\nTo express this invariant in the required format:\n- `sorted_value = min(arr[0]->arr[f])`\n\nThis invariant should hold true before and after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = min(arr[0]->arr[f])`"}]
