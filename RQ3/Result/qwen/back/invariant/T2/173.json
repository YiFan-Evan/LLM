In this implementation, the outer loop runs from `n=0` to `len(arr)-1`, which means it iterates over each element of the array. For each element, the inner while loop shifts elements that are greater than the current element to the right until the correct position for the current element is found.\n\nThe goal is to find a loop invariant for the outer loop, which should hold true before and after each iteration of the loop. A good candidate for a loop invariant would be a statement about the state of the array up to the current index `n`.\n\nConsidering the nature of the insertion sort, a suitable loop invariant could be:\n\n- The subarray `arr[0:n]` is sorted.\n\nLet's write this loop invariant in the required format:\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr[0:n]_value = sorted(arr[0:n])\n```\n\nHowever, since the provided format requires a specific function format, let's rephrase it slightly to fit the format:\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr[0:n]_value = sorted(arr[0:n])\n```\n\nBut since the format specifically asks for a function of the array elements and not explicitly mentioning the sorting function, we can simplify it as follows:\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr[0:n]_value = arr[0:n]_sorted\n```\n\nHere, `_sorted` implies that the elements in the subarray `arr[0:n]` are in sorted order.\n\nGiven the constraints of the format, the most appropriate loop invariant in the specified format would be:\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr[0:n]_value = arr[0:n]_sorted\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we need to identify a loop invariant for the outer while loop in the insertion sort algorithm.
