Insertion sort works by dividing the array into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. In each iteration of the outer loop, the algorithm takes one element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted portion.\n\n- **Outer Loop (`while s < len(arr)`):** This loop runs from the start of the array until the end, gradually expanding the sorted portion.\n- **Inner Loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`):** This loop ensures that the current element being considered is placed in the correct position within the sorted portion by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are out of order.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm using loop invariants, we need to identify what remains true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nThe outer loop invariant can be stated as follows:\n\n- **Invariant:** At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop (`s == i`), the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted.\n\nLet's write this in the required format:\n- **Invariant:** `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:s])`\n- **Explanation:** Before the i-th iteration starts, the subarray from index 0 to `s-1` (inclusive) is sorted.\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nThe inner loop invariant can be stated as follows:\n\n- **Invariant:** At the start of the j-th iteration of the inner loop (`z == j`), the element at index `j` is in its correct position relative to the elements in the sorted subarray `arr[0:s-1]`.\n\nLet's write this in the required format:\n- **Invariant:** `correct_position_value = fun(arr[s-1], arr[s])`\n- **Explanation:** Before the j-th iteration starts, the element at index `s` is correctly positioned relative to the elements in the sorted subarray `arr[0:s-1]`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant:** `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:s])`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant:** `correct_position_value = fun(arr[s-1], arr[s])`\n\nThese invariants ensure that the array is progressively sorted as the loops progress."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = -1\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\n        s += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code is a variant of the insertion sort algorithm. The main difference is that the initial value of `s` is `-1`, which means the first iteration will set `s` to `0`.
