[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This invariant will help us understand that the variable `min_value` always holds the minimum value from the elements examined so far.\n\nThe fundamental principle here is that at any point during the execution of the loop, the current value of `min_value` contains the smallest element seen in the array from the start up to the current position `h`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nBefore the i-th iteration of the loop, `min_value` has been updated to hold the minimum value of the subarray `arr[0] -> arr[h-1]`. Therefore, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n**min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[h-1])** \n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[h-1])**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        if arr[h] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[h]\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the `find_min` function, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.
