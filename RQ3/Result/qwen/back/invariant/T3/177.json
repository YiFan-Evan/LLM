Insertion sort works by dividing the input array into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. Initially, the sorted portion contains just the first element, and the unsorted portion contains the rest. The algorithm repeatedly takes the first element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into its correct position within the sorted portion.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the algorithm using loop invariants, we need to define properties that hold true before and after each iteration of the inner loop, as well as the outer loop.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop (r)\n\nThe outer loop runs from `r = 0` to `len(arr) - 1`. The loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as follows:\n\n- Before the loop starts, the subarray `arr[0:r]` is sorted.\n- After each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:r+1]` is sorted.\n\nFormally, this can be written as:\n```\nsorted_subarray_length = r\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop (z)\n\nThe inner loop runs from `z = r` to `1`, ensuring that the elements are shifted to their correct positions within the sorted subarray. The loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as follows:\n\n- Before the loop starts, the subarray `arr[r-1:r+1]` is sorted.\n- After each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[r-z:r+1]` is sorted.\n\nFormally, this can be written as:\n```\nsorted_subarray_length = r - z + 1\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_subarray_length = r\nsorted_subarray_length = r - z + 1\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = len(arr)\n    while r > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        r -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code seems to have some issues, particularly with the initialization and usage of the variable `i`. Additionally, the logic for the inner loop does not correctly reflect the typical behavior of insertion sort. Let's correct the code and then derive the loop invariants.\n\n### Corrected Code\n\nHere is the corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = 1  # Start from the second element\n    while r < len(arr):\n        key = arr[r]\n        z = r - 1\n        while z >= 0 and arr[z] > key:\n            arr[z + 1] = arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        arr[z + 1] = key\n        r += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop (r)\n\nThe outer loop runs from `r = 1` to `len(arr) - 1`. The loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as follows:\n\n- Before the loop starts, the subarray `arr[0:r]` is sorted.\n- After each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:r+1]` is sorted.\n\nFormally, this can be written as:\n```\nsorted_subarray_length = r\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop (z)\n\nThe inner loop runs from `z = r - 1` to `0`, ensuring that the elements are shifted to their correct positions within the sorted subarray. The loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as follows:\n\n- Before the loop starts, the subarray `arr[r-1:r+1]` is partially sorted.\n- After each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[r-z:r+1]` is sorted.\n\nFormally, this can be written as:\n```\nsorted_subarray_length = r - z\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_subarray_length = r\nsorted_subarray_length = r - z\n```"}]
