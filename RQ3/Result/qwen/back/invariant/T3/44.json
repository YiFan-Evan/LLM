A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.

This function counts the number of times the `target` value appears in the array `arr` by iterating from the end of the array to the beginning.\n\n### Fundamental Principles Involved:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `e` is set to the length of `arr`, and `count_value` is initialized to 0.\n2. **Maintenance**: During each iteration, if the current element (`arr[e]`) matches the `target`, `count_value` is incremented.\n3. **Termination**: After the loop ends, `count_value` should hold the total count of occurrences of `target` in `arr`.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\n\nThe loop invariant should describe the state of the `count_value` variable relative to the part of the array that has been processed so far. Specifically, after each iteration, `count_value` should represent the number of occurrences of `target` in the subarray from the start of `arr` up to but not including the current index `e`.\n\nFormally, we can express this as:\n- `count_value = sum(1 for x in arr[e+1:len(arr)] if x == target)`\n\nHowever, since we are asked to provide the answer in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we need to adapt this to fit the required format.\n\n### Answer:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\ncount_value = sum(1 for x in arr[e+1]->arr[len(arr)-1] if x == target)\n```\n\nThis means that at the i-th iteration, `count_value` equals the sum of 1 for each element in the subarray `arr[e+1]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]` that matches the `target`."}]
