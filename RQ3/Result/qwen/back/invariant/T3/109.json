To prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true throughout the execution of a loop.\n\nIn this case, the key aspect to consider is the state of `member_value` relative to the elements processed so far in the array. Specifically, we want to ensure that `member_value` contains the correct value if the current index (`j`) matches the given `id`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo construct a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop, we need to describe the state of `member_value` in terms of the elements processed so far in the array. Since `member_value` is updated only when `j` equals `id`, we can say that `member_value` retains the value of `arr[id]` if the loop has processed up to `id`.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n- Before the i-th iteration, `member_value` contains the value of `arr[id]` if `j` has reached `id`. Otherwise, `member_value` remains `-1`.\n\nFormally, this can be written as:\n\n- `member_value = arr[id] if j >= id else -1`\n\nHowever, since we are asked to write the invariant in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we adjust it slightly:\n\n- `member_value = arr[id] if j >= id else -1`\n\nSince `j` is the index being processed in the loop and it starts from `0`, we need to ensure that `member_value` is correctly set if `j` reaches or exceeds `id`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n`member_value = arr[id] if j >= id else -1`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    j = len(arr)\n    while j > 0:\n        j -= 1\n        if j == id:\n            member_value = arr[j]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe function `give_member` aims to retrieve the value at a specific index (`id`) from an array (`arr`).
