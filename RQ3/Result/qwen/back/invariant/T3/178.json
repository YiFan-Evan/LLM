Insertion sort iteratively builds a sorted portion of the array from left to right. In each iteration, it takes an element from the unsorted portion of the array and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted portion.\n\nThe loop invariant for the outer `while` loop can be formulated as follows:\n- At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:s]` is sorted.\n- The variable `s` represents the size of the sorted subarray.\n\nFor the inner `while` loop, we need to ensure that the element at index `z` is correctly placed within the sorted portion of the array. The loop invariant for the inner `while` loop can be formulated as follows:\n- At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[z:len(arr)]` remains unchanged.\n- The elements in the subarray `arr[0:z]` are in sorted order.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop\n\nLet's formulate the loop invariant for the outer loop:\n\n**Loop Invariant:** At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:s]` is sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop\n\nNow, let's formulate the loop invariant for the inner loop:\n\n**Loop Invariant:** At the start of the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[z:len(arr)]` remains unchanged, and the subarray `arr[0:z]` is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:s]->arr[0:s])`\n- For the inner loop: `unchanged_value = fun(arr[z:len(arr)]->arr[z:len(arr)])`\n\nWhere `fun` is a function that represents the state of the array segment as being sorted or unchanged, respectively. Specifically:\n\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:s]->arr[0:s])` indicates that the subarray `arr[0:s]` is sorted.\n- `unchanged_value = fun(arr[z:len(arr)]->arr[z:len(arr)])` indicates that the subarray `arr[z:len(arr)]` remains unchanged."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = len(arr)\n    while s > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        s -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code is intended to perform an insertion sort on the array `arr`. However, there are some issues with the implementation that need to be corrected before determining the loop invariants. Specifically, the inner loop logic and the handling of indices are incorrect.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for s in range(1, len(arr)):  # Start from the second element\n        key = arr[s]\n        z = s - 1\n        while z >= 0 and arr[z] > key:\n            arr[z + 1] = arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        arr[z + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\nNow, let's analyze the loop invariants for both the outer and inner loops.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop\n\nThe outer loop runs from `s = 1` to `s = len(arr) - 1`, ensuring that after each iteration, the first `s` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:s]` is sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop\n\nThe inner loop runs from `z = s - 1` down to `z = 0`, ensuring that the current element (`key`) is inserted into its correct position within the sorted subarray.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** At the start of the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0:z+1]` is sorted, and the element `arr[z+1]` is the current key to be inserted into the sorted subarray.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:s]->arr[0:s])`\n- For the inner loop: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:z+1]->arr[0:z+1])`\n\nWhere `fun` is a function that represents the state of the array segment as being sorted. Specifically:\n\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:s]->arr[0:s])` indicates that the subarray `arr[0:s]` is sorted.\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:z+1]->arr[0:z+1])` indicates that the subarray `arr[0:z+1]` is sorted."}]
