This algorithm works by dividing the input array into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. Initially, the sorted portion consists of just the first element, and the unsorted portion consists of all other elements. The algorithm repeatedly takes the first element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted portion.\n\n### Fundamental Principles Involved\n\n- **Insertion Sort**: It iteratively builds a sorted portion of the array by taking one element at a time from the unsorted portion and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted portion.\n- **Loop Invariant**: A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For insertion sort, we want to ensure that after sorting any number of elements, the elements up to that point are correctly sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariants\n\nThe `while` loop in the code iterates over the array, sorting elements one by one. We need to define two loop invariants:\n\n1. **Outer Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (where `b` is the loop variable), the subarray `arr[0:b]` is sorted.\n2. **Inner Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the inner loop (where `z` is the loop variable), the subarray `arr[z:len(arr)]` contains elements that are greater than or equal to the element at `arr[z-1]`.\n\n### Defining the Loop Invariants\n\nFor the outer loop:\n- **Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:b] -> arr[0:b])` where `fun` is a function that returns a sorted version of the subarray `arr[0:b]`. Since we know the subarray `arr[0:b]` is sorted, we can say `sorted_value = arr[0:b]`.\n\nFor the inner loop:\n- **Invariant**: `greater_value = fun(arr[z:len(arr)] -> arr[z:len(arr)])` where `fun` is a function that ensures the elements in `arr[z:len(arr)]` are greater than or equal to `arr[z-1]`. Given that the inner loop swaps elements to maintain this order, we can say `greater_value = arr[z:len(arr)]`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- Outer Loop Invariant: `sorted_value = arr[0:b]`\n- Inner Loop Invariant: `greater_value = arr[z:len(arr)]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = len(arr)\n    while b > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        b -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation of the Problem\n\nThe provided code is intended to implement the insertion sort algorithm, but there is an issue with the loop conditions and logic. Specifically, the outer loop starts from the length of the array and decrements, and the inner loop condition and increment are incorrect.\n\n### Fundamental Principles Involved\n\n1. **Insertion Sort Algorithm**:\n   - Insertion sort works by iterating through the array, taking one element at a time, and inserting it into its correct position in the already sorted part of the array.\n   - The sorted part of the array grows from left to right, and the unsorted part shrinks from left to right.\n\n2. **Loop Invariants**:\n   - **Outer Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:b]` is sorted.\n   - **Inner Loop Invariant**: At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[z-1:z+1]` is in the correct order, and elements after `z` are greater than or equal to the elements before `z`.\n\n### Corrected Code and Invariants\n\nGiven the issues in the original code, let's correct it and define the loop invariants properly.\n\nCorrected code:\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = 1  # Start from the second element\n    while b < len(arr):\n        z = b\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        b += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Loop Invariants\n\n1. **Outer Loop Invariant**:\n   - At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (where `b` is the loop variable), the subarray `arr[0:b]` is sorted.\n   - Therefore, the outer loop invariant is: `sorted_value = arr[0:b]`\n\n2. **Inner Loop Invariant**:\n   - At the start of each iteration of the inner loop (where `z` is the loop variable), the subarray `arr[z-1:z+1]` is in the correct order, and elements after `z` are greater than or equal to the elements before `z`.\n   - Therefore, the inner loop invariant is: `correct_order_value = arr[z-1:z+1]`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- Outer Loop Invariant: `sorted_value = arr[0:b]`\n- Inner Loop Invariant: `correct_order_value = arr[z-1:z+1]`"}]
