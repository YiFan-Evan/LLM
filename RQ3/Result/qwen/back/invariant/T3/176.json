This algorithm works by iterating through the array and gradually building up a sorted portion of the array. During each iteration, the current element is compared with the elements before it, and if it's smaller, they are swapped until it's in the correct position.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this algorithm, we need to identify a loop invariant for the inner loop. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For the inner loop, the loop invariant can be formulated as follows:\n\n- **Invariant for the Inner Loop:** At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray from index 0 to index `z-1` is sorted, and every element in this subarray is less than or equal to the element at index `z`.\n\n### Answer\n\nGiven the above principles, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be expressed as:\n\n- **Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop:**\n  ```\n  sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z-1])\n  ```\n\nHowever, to make it fit the specific format requested:\n\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z-1])\n```\n\nBut since the exact function `fun` is not defined, we use a general form:\n\n```\nsorted_value = arr[0] <= arr[1] <= ... <= arr[z-1]\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\nsorted_value = arr[0] <= arr[1] <= ... <= arr[z-1]\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = len(arr)\n    while q > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        q -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It appears there is a misunderstanding in the provided code. Specifically, the variable `q` starts at `len(arr)` and decrements, while the inner loop uses `z` starting from `i`, which isn't defined within the scope of the function. Let's correct the code first and then determine the appropriate loop invariant.\n\n### Corrected Code\n\nHere is the corrected version of the insertion sort function:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for q in range(len(arr)):\n        z = q\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Fundamental Principles Involved\n\nInsertion sort works by iterating through the array and inserting each element into its correct position in the already sorted portion of the array. \n\n- **Outer Loop:** Iterates over the array, treating each element as the new element to be inserted.\n- **Inner Loop:** Moves the new element backwards until it finds its correct position within the sorted portion.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the inner loop, the loop invariant should reflect that the subarray from index 0 to index `z-1` is sorted, and every element in this subarray is less than or equal to the element at index `z`.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop\n\nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be expressed as:\n\n```\nsorted_value = arr[0] <= arr[1] <= ... <= arr[z-1]\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```\nsorted_value = arr[0] <= arr[1] <= ... <= arr[z-1]\n```"}]
