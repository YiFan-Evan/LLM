[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This means that `max_value` is set to the first element of the array.\n  \n- **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the loop, the value of `t` is incremented, and the loop checks if `arr[t]` is greater than the current `max_value`. If it is, `max_value` is updated to `arr[t]`. This ensures that `max_value` always contains the maximum value encountered so far in the array from index `0` to `t`.\n\n- **Termination**: When the loop terminates (i.e., when `t >= len(arr)`), `max_value` will have been updated to the maximum value found in the entire array.\n\n### Loop Invariant Statement:\n\nThe loop invariant can be stated as follows:\n\n\"Before each iteration of the loop, `max_value` contains the maximum value of the elements in `arr` from index `0` to `t-1`.\"\n\nIn terms of the required format, we express this as:\n\n\"max_value_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[t-1])\"\n\nHowever, since the exact functional form isn't strictly necessary beyond the concept of the invariant, we can simplify it to a more understandable statement within the format provided:\n\n\"max_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[t-1])\"\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: max_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[t-1])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[-1]\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        if arr[t] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[t]\n    return max_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prove the partial correctness of the `find_max` function, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the while loop.
