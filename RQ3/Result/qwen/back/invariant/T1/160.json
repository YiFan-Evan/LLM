Insertion Sort works by dividing the array into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. In each iteration, it takes one element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted portion.\n\n- **Outer Loop**: The outer loop (`while a < len(arr)`) iterates over each element of the array, treating the subarray `arr[0:a]` as the sorted portion.\n- **Inner Loop**: The inner loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`) ensures that the current element (`arr[a-1]`, initially) is moved to its correct position within the sorted portion by swapping adjacent elements if they are out of order.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm using loop invariants, we need to establish a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\nFor the **outer loop**:\n- Before the loop starts, the subarray `arr[0:0]` (i.e., the first element) is trivially sorted.\n- After each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:a]` is sorted.\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- **Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop**: \n  ```\n  sorted_value = fun(arr[0:a])\n  ```\n\nGiven that `arr[0:a]` is sorted after each iteration of the outer loop, we can express this as:\n- **Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop**:\n  ```\n  sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:a])\n  ```\n\nFor the **inner loop**:\n- Before the inner loop starts for a given `a`, the last element of the sorted subarray (`arr[a-1]`) might not be in the correct position relative to the elements in the unsorted portion.\n- After the inner loop completes, the last element of the sorted subarray (`arr[a-1]`) is correctly positioned among the sorted elements, and the subarray `arr[0:a]` remains sorted.\n\nThus, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- **Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop**:\n  ```\n  sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:a])\n  ```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answers are:\n\nFor the outer loop:\n```\nsorted_value = sorted(arr[0:a])\n```\n\nFor the inner loop:\n```\nsorted_value = sorted(arr[0:a])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    a = 0\n    while a <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        a += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nThe provided code is an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.
