A loop invariant is a condition that remains true throughout the execution of the loop.\n\nIn this case, the goal is to find the minimum value in the array `arr`. To do so, we maintain a variable `min_value` that keeps track of the smallest element seen so far. \n\nThe loop invariant should capture the fact that `min_value` contains the minimum value among the elements processed so far. Specifically, at the start of each iteration, `min_value` should be the minimum value among `arr[0]` through `arr[n-1]`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nLet's define the loop invariant for the `n`-th iteration of the loop:\n\n**Loop Invariant:** At the start of the `n`-th iteration of the loop, `min_value` is the minimum value among `arr[0]` through `arr[n-1]`.\n\nFormally, we can write this as:\n- **Invariant:** `min_value_value = min(arr[0:n])`\n\n### Explanation\n\n- Before the loop starts (`n=0`), `min_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`, which is trivially the minimum of the empty subarray `arr[0:0]`.\n- During each iteration, `n` increases by 1. If `arr[n]` is less than `min_value`, `min_value` is updated to `arr[n]`. Otherwise, `min_value` remains unchanged.\n- By the end of each iteration, `min_value` will indeed be the minimum value among `arr[0]` through `arr[n]`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- **Loop Invariant:** `min_value_value = min(arr[0:n])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    n = 0\n    while n <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[n] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[n]\n        n += 1\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the `find_min` function, we need to establish a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.
