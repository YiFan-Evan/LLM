This algorithm works by dividing the input array into a sorted part and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part consists of just the first element, and the unsorted part contains the rest of the elements. The algorithm repeatedly takes the first element from the unsorted part and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted part.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm using loop invariants, we need to identify what properties hold true before and after each iteration of the loops. For the outer loop (with variable `i`), a suitable loop invariant would be related to the portion of the array that has been sorted up to that point. For the inner loop (with variable `z`), the invariant would describe the state of the array as elements are being shifted to insert the current element in its correct position.\n\n### Answer\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nThe outer loop runs from `i = 0` to `i < len(arr)`. Before the i-th iteration of this loop, the first `i` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** \n- `sorted_value = arr[:i]`\n\nThis means that after each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted.\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nThe inner loop runs from `z = i` to `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`. Before the z-th iteration of this loop, the elements `arr[z]` to `arr[i]` are in their original order but may not be sorted yet.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** \n- `unsorted_value = arr[z:i+1]`\n\nThis means that after each iteration of the inner loop, the elements `arr[z:i+1]` are shifted such that `arr[z]` is placed in the correct position within the sorted portion `arr[:z]`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nCombining these two invariants, we can conclude the correctness of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n- After the completion of the outer loop, the entire array `arr` is sorted because the loop invariant guarantees that `arr[:i]` is sorted for all `i`.\n- The inner loop ensures that each element is correctly positioned within the sorted portion of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- Outer Loop Invariant: `sorted_value = arr[:i]`\n- Inner Loop Invariant: `unsorted_value = arr[z:i+1]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided Python function `insertion_sort` implements the insertion sort algorithm. The goal of this algorithm is to sort an array by repeatedly taking one element from the unsorted part and inserting it into the correct position within the sorted part. To prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to identify appropriate loop invariants for both the outer and inner loops.\n\n### Analysis of the Code\n\n1. **Outer Loop (Variable `i`)**:\n   - The outer loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i <= len(arr) - 1`.\n   - This means the loop runs until `i` reaches the length of the array.\n   - The loop invariant should capture the state of the array where the first `i` elements are sorted.\n\n2. **Inner Loop (Variable `z`)**:\n   - The inner loop runs from `z = i` to `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`.\n   - This means the loop continues as long as there are elements in the unsorted part (`arr[i:]`) that need to be inserted into the sorted part (`arr[:i]`).\n   - The loop invariant should capture the state where the elements `arr[z:i+1]` are being shifted to ensure `arr[z]` is in the correct position within the sorted part.\n\n### Loop Invariants\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nBefore the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `i` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- `sorted_value = arr[:i]`\n\nThis means that after each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted.\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nBefore the z-th iteration of the inner loop, the elements `arr[z:i+1]` are in their original order but may not be sorted yet.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\n- `unsorted_value = arr[z:i+1]`\n\nThis means that after each iteration of the inner loop, the elements `arr[z:i+1]` are shifted such that `arr[z]` is placed in the correct position within the sorted portion `arr[:z]`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy combining these two invariants, we can conclude the correctness of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n- After the completion of the outer loop, the entire array `arr` is sorted because the loop invariant guarantees that `arr[:i]` is sorted for all `i`.\n- The inner loop ensures that each element is correctly positioned within the sorted portion of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- Outer Loop Invariant: `sorted_value = arr[:i]`\n- Inner Loop Invariant: `unsorted_value = arr[z:i+1]`"}]
