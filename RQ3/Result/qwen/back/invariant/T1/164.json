Insertion sort works by dividing the array into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. In each iteration of the outer loop, the algorithm takes one element from the unsorted portion and inserts it into its correct position within the sorted portion.\n\n- **Outer Loop (Variable `e`)**: This loop iterates over the array elements. It starts with the assumption that the first `e` elements are already sorted.\n- **Inner Loop (Variable `z`)**: This loop compares the current element (`arr[e]`, initially set to `arr[i]`) with the previous elements and shifts those elements to the right if they are greater than the current element. This process ensures that the current element is placed in its correct position within the sorted portion.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to establish a loop invariant for both the outer and inner loops.\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nWe want to show that after each iteration of the outer loop, the first `e` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n**Invariant Statement**: \n- `sorted_value = lambda x: x == sorted(arr[:e])`\n\nThis means that after the `e`-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:e]` is sorted.\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nWe want to show that during the execution of the inner loop, the elements between `z` and `e` are being shifted to their correct positions within the sorted portion.\n\n**Invariant Statement**: \n- `sorted_value = lambda x: x == sorted(arr[:e]) and arr[z] <= arr[z+1] for all z in range(e)`\n\nThis means that at any point during the execution of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0:e]` remains sorted and the elements between `z` and `e` are being correctly positioned.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = lambda x: x == sorted(arr[:e])`\n- For the inner loop: `sorted_value = lambda x: x == sorted(arr[:e]) and arr[z] <= arr[z+1] for all z in range(e)`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code is an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm.

It selects each element in the array one by one to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array.\n- **Inner Loop (Variable `z`)**: This loop runs as long as `z > 0` and the element before `z` is greater than the element at `z`.
