Specifically, `member_value` is updated only when `o` equals `id`. Therefore, the invariant should reflect that `member_value` is set to the value at index `id` if the loop has processed up to and including index `id`.\n\nGiven this, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[o-1])`\n\nHowever, since `member_value` is only updated when `o == id`, a more precise invariant would be:\n\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[id-1])`\n\nThis means that `member_value` is correctly set to the value at index `id` if the loop has already reached `id`, and otherwise remains `-1`.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n- `member_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[id-1])`"}]
