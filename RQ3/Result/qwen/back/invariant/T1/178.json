Insertion sort works by iterating through the array and growing a sorted section of the array one element at a time. For each element, it is compared with the elements before it, and if it is smaller, those elements are shifted to make space for the current element.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm, we need to identify a loop invariant for each loop in the code. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For the insertion sort algorithm, a common loop invariant is that the subarray from the start up to the current position is sorted.\n\n### Analysis of the Code\n\n1. **Outer Loop**: \n   - The outer loop runs from `s = 0` to `len(arr) - 1`.\n   - This loop ensures that each element is considered as the \"current\" element that needs to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array.\n   \n2. **Inner Loop**: \n   - The inner loop runs from `z = s` down to `1` while checking if `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`.\n   - This loop shifts elements to the right until the correct position for the current element is found.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop\n\nThe loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- **Invariant**: The subarray `arr[0:s]` is sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop\n\nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- **Invariant**: The subarray `arr[0:z+1]` is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the loop invariant of the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\n\n- **Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:s])`\n  \nAnd for the inner loop:\n\n- **Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:z+1])`\n\nWhere `fun` is a function that represents the sorted state of the subarray from index `0` to `s` or `z+1`, respectively. \n\nFor simplicity, we can write the loop invariants in the specified format:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:s])`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:z+1])`\n\nHowever, since the specific function `fun` isn't required, we can just specify the subarray range directly:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: `arr[0:s]_sorted = True`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: `arr[0:z+1]_sorted = True`\n\nBut in the required format:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: `arr[0:s]_sorted = True`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: `arr[0:z+1]_sorted = True`\n\nThus, the final answer in the specified format is:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: `arr[0:s]_sorted = True`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: `arr[0:z+1]_sorted = True`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = 0\n    while s <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        s += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code implements the **Insertion Sort** algorithm. The algorithm works by dividing the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. With each iteration, the algorithm takes the next element from the unsorted region and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted region.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this algorithm, we need to establish loop invariants for both the outer and inner loops. These loop invariants should hold true before and after each iteration of the respective loops.\n\n### Analysis of the Code\n\n1. **Outer Loop**:\n   - The outer loop runs while `s <= len(arr) - 1`.\n   - This loop ensures that each element in the array is considered for insertion into the sorted portion of the array.\n\n2. **Inner Loop**:\n   - The inner loop runs while `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`.\n   - This loop shifts elements to the right until the correct position for the current element (`arr[s]`) is found.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Outer Loop\n\nThe loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- **Invariant**: The subarray `arr[0:s]` is sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop\n\nThe loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- **Invariant**: The subarray `arr[0:z+1]` is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer in the specified format is:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: `arr[0:s]_sorted = True`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: `arr[0:z+1]_sorted = True`\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: `arr[0:s]_sorted = True`\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: `arr[0:z+1]_sorted = True`"}]
