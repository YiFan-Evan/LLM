[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Thus, `last_value` always holds the value of the last element seen up to the current index `o-1`.\n- **After the loop**: When `o` reaches `len(arr)`, the loop invariant ensures that `last_value` holds the value of the last element in the array.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: `last_value = arr[0->o-1]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_last(arr):\n    last_value = arr[0]\n    o = 0\n    while o <= len(arr) - 1:\n        last_value = arr[o]\n        o += 1\n    return last_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prove the partial correctness of the `give_last` function, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.
