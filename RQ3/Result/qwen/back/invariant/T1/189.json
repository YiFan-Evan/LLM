The core idea behind Selection Sort is to divide the array into two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. In each iteration of the outer loop, the algorithm selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning of this part. \n\n- **Outer Loop (`while j < len(arr)`):** This loop runs from the start of the array until the end, gradually increasing the size of the sorted part of the array.\n  \n- **Inner Loop (`while z < len(arr)`):** This loop searches for the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array starting from index `j`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the Selection Sort algorithm, we need to identify a loop invariant for both the outer and inner loops. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, we can state the invariant as follows:\n\n- **Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:j]` contains the `j` smallest elements from the original array, and these elements are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nThis invariant can be expressed as:\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0:j])\n```\n\nSince the elements in `arr[0:j]` are sorted and represent the smallest `j` elements, the function `fun` here could be considered as a function that verifies the sorted order and the correct values.\n\nHowever, since we're asked to use a specific format, let's consider the simplest form of verifying the sorted property:\n```\nsorted_value = all(arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for i in range(j-1))\n```\n\nBut for simplicity and sticking to the required format, we'll just denote the sorted part directly:\n```\nsorted_value = arr[0:j]\n```\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nFor the inner loop, we can state the invariant as follows:\n\n- **Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, the element at index `j` is the smallest element in the subarray `arr[j:len(arr)]`.\n\nThis invariant can be expressed as:\n```\nsmallest_value = min(arr[j:z])\n```\n\nBut again, for simplicity and sticking to the required format, we'll just denote the current smallest value:\n```\nsmallest_value = arr[j]\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven the constraints of the required format and the need to provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration, we can formulate the invariant for the outer loop as:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_value = arr[0:j]\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    j = 0\n    while j <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = j + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[j]:\n                temp = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        j += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code implements the Selection Sort algorithm, which sorts an array in ascending order. The algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning of the unsorted part.\n\n- **Outer Loop (`while j <= len(arr) - 1`):** This loop iterates over the array indices from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`. For each iteration, it ensures that the first `j` elements are sorted and the remaining elements are unsorted.\n  \n- **Inner Loop (`while z <= len(arr) - 1`):** This loop finds the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array starting from index `j`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the Selection Sort algorithm, we need to identify a loop invariant for both the outer and inner loops.\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, the invariant is that after the i-th iteration, the first `j` elements of the array are sorted and the rest of the array is unsorted.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n```\nsorted_value = arr[0:j] is sorted\n```\n\nHowever, since we need to stick to the format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can express it as:\n```\nsorted_value = arr[0:j]\n```\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nFor the inner loop, the invariant is that after the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the element at index `j` is the smallest element in the subarray `arr[j:len(arr)]`.\n\nThis can be expressed as:\n```\nsmallest_value = arr[j]\n```\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_value = arr[0:j]\n```"}]
