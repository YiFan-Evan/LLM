A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.

Since the loop runs while `s <= len(arr) - 1`, the invariant should hold for all iterations up to `s-1`.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n- `max_value = max(arr[0] -> arr[s-1])`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `max_value = max(arr[0] -> arr[s-1])`."}]
