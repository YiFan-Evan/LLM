The goal of this function is to find the minimum value in an array.\n\nThe loop invariant should capture the property that has been maintained throughout the loop iterations. In this case, we want to ensure that `min_value` always holds the minimum value encountered so far in the array from the start up to the current element being checked.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nBefore the loop starts, `min_value` is initialized to the first element of the array (`arr[0]`). As the loop progresses, `min_value` is updated whenever a smaller element is found. Thus, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\n\n- Before the i-th iteration of the loop, `min_value` contains the minimum value of the subarray `arr[0] -> arr[e-1]`.\n\nFormally, this can be written as:\n- `min_value = min(arr[0] -> arr[e-1])`\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `min_value = min(arr[0] -> arr[e-1])`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[e] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[e]\n        e += 1\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the `find_min` function, we need to identify a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.
