In each iteration of the outer loop, the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array is moved to its correct position.\n\n- **Outer Loop (`o`):** This loop runs from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`. In each iteration, it fixes the position of one element.\n- **Inner Loop (`z`):** For each fixed position determined by the outer loop, this loop finds the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion and swaps it with the current element at position `o`.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this algorithm, we need a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner loop. \n\n### Loop Invariant for the Inner Loop\n\nBefore each iteration of the inner loop (with index `z`), the elements from the start of the array up to the current position `o` are already sorted, and the element at position `o` is the smallest among all elements from position `o` to the end of the array.\n\nFormally, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n- **Loop Invariant:** `sorted_value = min(arr[o]->arr[-1])`\n\nThis means that the value at the `o`th position (`arr[o]`) is the minimum value among all elements from position `o` to the end of the array (`arr[-1]`).\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n- **Loop Invariant:** `sorted_value = min(arr[o]->arr[-1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    o = 0\n    while o <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = o + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[o]:\n                temp = arr[o]\n                arr[o] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        o += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles Involved\n\nThe provided code implements the Selection Sort algorithm, which sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.
