[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. In this case, the goal is to ensure that the variable `member_value` correctly reflects the value of the array element at the specified index (`id`) when the loop terminates.\n\nThe loop iterates through the array `arr`, and if the current index `t` matches the given `id`, the value at that index is assigned to `member_value`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nBefore and after each iteration of the loop, the value of `member_value` should reflect the value of the array element at the specified index (`id`) if the loop has reached that index. If the loop has not yet reached the specified index, `member_value` should remain `-1`.\n\nFormally, we can state the loop invariant as:\n\n- Before the loop starts: `member_value = -1`\n- After each iteration `i`: `member_value = arr[id] if t == id else -1`\n\nSince `t` is the loop variable and the loop runs from `0` to `len(arr)-1`, we can rewrite the invariant in terms of the loop variable `t`:\n\n- `member_value = arr[id] if t == id else -1`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n`member_value = arr[id] if t == id else -1`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    t = 0\n    while t <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if t == id:\n            member_value = arr[t]\n        t += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the `give_member` function, we need to identify a loop invariant. The function aims to find the value at a specific index `id` in the array `arr`.
