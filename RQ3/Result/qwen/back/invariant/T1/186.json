In this algorithm, the array is divided into two parts:\n- A sorted part at the beginning of the array.\n- An unsorted part that contains the rest of the elements.\n\nDuring each iteration of the outer loop (controlled by the variable `g`), the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array is selected and swapped with the element at the beginning of the unsorted part. This effectively grows the sorted part of the array by one element.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the selection sort algorithm, we need to establish a loop invariant for the outer loop. The loop invariant should describe a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nThe loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as follows:\n\n- Before the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n- The elements `arr[i]` through `arr[len(arr)-1]` are the remaining unsorted elements.\n\nThis loop invariant ensures that after each iteration, the sorted portion of the array is correctly sorted, and the unsorted portion contains the remaining elements.\n\n### Formulating the Loop Invariant\n\nWe need to express this loop invariant in the format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`.\n\n- `xxx_value` can be interpreted as the state of the sorted portion of the array.\n- `fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])` can be interpreted as the transformation applied to the array during the loop iterations.\n\nGiven this, we can formulate the loop invariant as:\n\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:g])`\n- `unsorted_value = unsorted(arr[g:len(arr)])`\n\nHowever, since we need to express this in the exact format requested (`xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`), we can simplify it to:\n\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:g])`\n- `unsorted_value = unsorted(arr[g:len(arr)])`\n\nSince we are focusing on the sorted part of the array, we can write the loop invariant as:\n\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:g])`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n- `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:g])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    g = 0\n    while g <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = g + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[g]:\n                temp = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        g += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles Involved\n\nThe `selection_sort` function sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm.
