In this algorithm, elements are progressively inserted into their correct position within a sorted section of the array. \n\nInitially, the array can be considered as two parts: a sorted part and an unsorted part. At the start, the sorted part consists of just the first element, and the unsorted part consists of the rest of the array.\n\nDuring each iteration of the outer `while` loop, the outer loop variable `b` represents the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts of the array. The inner `while` loop then takes the next unsorted element and inserts it into its correct place within the sorted part of the array.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need a loop invariant for the outer loop:\n\n- **Loop Invariant**: At the i-th iteration of the outer loop (i.e., when `b == i`), the subarray `arr[0:b]` contains the first `b` elements of the original array, and these elements are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nGiven the above explanation, let's formulate the loop invariant:\n\n- **Loop Invariant Statement**: \n  ```\n  Therefore, the final answer is: sorted_value = fun(arr[0:b]->arr[0:b])\n  ```\n\nHere, `fun(arr[0:b]->arr[0:b])` indicates that the subarray from index 0 to index `b-1` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Since the exact functional representation isn't required beyond the format, the invariant is correctly stated as:\n\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0:b]->arr[0:b])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = 0\n    while b <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        b += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nThe provided function `insertion_sort` is meant to sort an array using the insertion sort algorithm. The outer `while` loop iterates over each element of the array, treating the portion before the current element as already sorted and the current element as the new element to be placed in its correct position within the sorted portion.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, the loop invariant should capture the state of the array up to the current boundary `b`. Specifically, at the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:b]` should be sorted.\n\nGiven this, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be formulated as follows:\n\n- **Loop Invariant Statement**:\n  ```\n  Therefore, the final answer is: sorted_value = fun(arr[0:b]->arr[0:b])\n  ```\n\nThis means that at the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:b]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: sorted_value = fun(arr[0:b]->arr[0:b])\n```"}]
