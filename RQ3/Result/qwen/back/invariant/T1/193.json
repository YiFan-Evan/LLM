This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. The outer loop (`while n < len(arr)`) iterates through each position in the array, selecting the smallest element from the remaining unsorted portion and placing it in the correct sorted position.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the Selection Sort algorithm, we need to find a loop invariant for the outer loop. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For Selection Sort, a suitable loop invariant can be defined as follows:\n\n- **Loop Invariant**: At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first `i` elements of the array are sorted and are in their correct positions relative to each other.\n\n### Loop Invariant Formulation\n\nGiven that the loop invariant needs to be expressed in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can formulate the invariant as:\n\n- **Invariant**: `sorted_elements_value = fun(arr[0:n]->arr[0:n])`\n\nWhere `fun(arr[0:n]->arr[0:n])` represents the fact that the first `n` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_elements_value = fun(arr[0:n]->arr[0:n])\n``` \n\nThis means that at the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `n` is the current index), the first `n` elements of the array are sorted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    n = 0\n    while n <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = n + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[n]:\n                temp = arr[n]\n                arr[n] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        n += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To determine the loop invariant for the given `selection_sort` function, let's analyze the code step-by-step.\n\n### Fundamental Principles\n\n1. **Selection Sort Algorithm**:\n   - Selection Sort works by dividing the input array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part.\n   - Initially, the sorted part is empty, and the unsorted part contains all the elements.\n   - In each iteration of the outer loop, the algorithm finds the smallest element in the unsorted part and moves it to the end of the sorted part.\n   - This process repeats until the entire array is sorted.\n\n2. **Outer Loop Invariant**:\n   - We need to find a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the outer loop (`while n <= len(arr) - 1`).\n   - The invariant should reflect that the first `n` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n- **Invariant**: The first `n` elements of the array are sorted.\n\nExpressing this in the required format:\n- **Invariant**: `sorted_elements_value = fun(arr[0:n]->arr[0:n])`\n\nHere, `fun(arr[0:n]->arr[0:n])` indicates that the first `n` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nsorted_elements_value = fun(arr[0:n]->arr[0:n])\n```"}]
