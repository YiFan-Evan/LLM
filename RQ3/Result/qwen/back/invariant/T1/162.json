Insertion sort works by dividing the input array into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion. Initially, the sorted portion contains just the first element, and the unsorted portion contains the rest of the elements.\n\nIn each iteration of the outer `while` loop, the first element of the unsorted portion is inserted into the correct position within the sorted portion. This is achieved through a series of swaps in the inner `while` loop, which ensures that every element in the sorted portion is less than or equal to the next element.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to establish a loop invariant for the outer `while` loop. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\nIn this case, the loop invariant can be described as follows:\n\n- **Loop Invariant**: At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer `while` loop, the first `c` elements of the array `arr` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nGiven that the loop variable `c` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration, the invariant implies that after the i-th iteration, the first `i` elements of the array are sorted.\n\n### Formulating the Loop Invariant\n\nTo formulate the loop invariant in the requested format (`xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`), we consider the state of the array at the beginning of each iteration of the outer `while` loop. Specifically, the first `c` elements are sorted.\n\nThus, the loop invariant can be stated as:\n\n- **Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:c]->arr[0:c])`, where `fun` is a function that indicates the sorted order of the elements in the range `[0:c]`.\n\nSince the elements in the range `[0:c]` are sorted in non-decreasing order, we can express this as:\n\n- **Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:c])`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n`sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:c])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        c += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code is an implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm. Insertion Sort works by iterating over the array and inserting each element into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array. The sorted portion grows with each iteration, starting from the first element and expanding until the entire array is sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo establish a loop invariant for the outer `while` loop, we need to define a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. For the outer loop, the key idea is that the first `c` elements of the array are sorted after the `c`-th iteration.\n\n### Formulating the Loop Invariant\n\nLet's define the loop invariant for the outer `while` loop:\n\n- **Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:c])`\n\nThis means that at the start of the i-th iteration of the outer `while` loop, the first `c` elements of the array `arr` are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n`sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:c])`"}]
