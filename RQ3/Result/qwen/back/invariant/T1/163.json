The fundamental principle of Insertion Sort is to build a sorted section of the array one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into the correct position within the already sorted part of the array.\n\nThe outer `while` loop iterates through each element of the array, starting from the first element. For each element, the inner `while` loop ensures that the elements before the current element (`d`) are in sorted order by shifting any element that is greater than the current element (`arr[d]`) one position to the right until it finds the correct position for the current element.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program using a loop invariant, we need to establish a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer `while` loop:\n\n- **Invariant:** At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop (i.e., when `d = i`), the subarray `arr[0 -> i-1]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nThis invariant holds true because, by the end of each iteration of the outer loop, the first `i` elements of the array are guaranteed to be sorted. This is ensured by the inner loop, which shifts elements to their correct positions.\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n```\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0->d-1])\n``` \n\nHere, `fun` represents the property that the subarray `arr[0->d-1]` is sorted in non-decreasing order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = 0\n    while d <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        d += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Explanation\n\nThe provided code implements the Insertion Sort algorithm.
