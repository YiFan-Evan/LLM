However, there are some issues with the provided code:\n- The variable `i` is not defined anywhere in the code.\n- The inner loop is intended to shift elements to the right until the correct position for the current element is found.\n\nTo solve this problem and find a loop invariant, we need to focus on the correct implementation of the Insertion Sort algorithm and identify what remains true before and after each iteration of the loops.\n\n### Corrected Code\n\nHere is a corrected version of the Insertion Sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for l in range(1, len(arr)):  # Start from the second element\n        key = arr[l]\n        z = l\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > key:\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            z -= 1\n        arr[z] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop (with index `l`), we want to maintain the following loop invariant:\n\n**Loop Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[l-1]` is sorted.\n\nLet's break down the invariant step-by-step:\n\n1. **Initialization:** Before the first iteration (`l=1`), the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[0]` is trivially sorted (since it contains one element).\n\n2. **Maintenance:** During each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop ensures that the current element `arr[l]` is inserted into its correct position within the already sorted subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[l-1]`. This means that after the inner loop completes, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[l]` is sorted.\n\n3. **Termination:** When the outer loop terminates (`l` equals the length of the array), the entire array `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]` is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1])\n```\nWhere `fun` represents the property that the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[l-1]` is sorted. \n\nExpressing it in the required format:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code attempts to implement the Insertion Sort algorithm but has a few issues:\n- The variable `i` is undefined.\n- The loop invariant should capture the state of the array during the sorting process.\n\nWe need to define the loop invariant correctly to prove the partial correctness of the algorithm. The loop invariant should describe a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n### Corrected Code\n\nFirst, let's correct the code by defining `i` properly and adjusting the loop conditions:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for l in range(len(arr)):\n        key = arr[l]\n        z = l\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > key:\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            z -= 1\n        arr[z] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop (with index `l`), we need to define a loop invariant that captures the state of the array as the algorithm progresses.\n\n**Loop Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[l-1]` is sorted.\n\nThis invariant can be expressed as follows:\n- Before the first iteration (`l=0`), the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[-1]` (which is empty) is trivially sorted.\n- During each iteration, the inner loop ensures that the current element `arr[l]` is inserted into its correct position within the already sorted subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[l-1]`.\n- After the outer loop terminates, the entire array `arr[0]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]` is sorted.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1])\n```\nWhere `fun` represents the property that the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[l-1]` is sorted.\n\nExpressing it in the required format:\n```plaintext\nsorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1])\n```"}]
