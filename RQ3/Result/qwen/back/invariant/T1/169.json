Insertion sort works by iterating through the array, growing a sorted section at the beginning of the list. For each element, it is inserted into the correct position within the sorted section.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to find a loop invariant for the inner while loop. A loop invariant is a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n### Analysis of the Loop Invariant\n\nFor the inner while loop:\n```python\nwhile z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n    temp = arr[z]\n    arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n    arr[z - 1] = temp\n    z -= 1\n```\n- **Loop Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the inner while loop, the subarray `arr[0..z]` is sorted.\n  \nThis invariant means that by the time the inner while loop finishes, the elements from index 0 up to index `z` are in sorted order. This ensures that as the outer loop progresses, the left part of the array is always sorted.\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = arr[0->z]`\n\nThis loop invariant (`sorted_value = arr[0->z]`) ensures that the portion of the array processed so far is sorted, which helps in proving the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = 0\n    while j <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        j += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided Python function `insertion_sort` aims to sort an array using the insertion sort algorithm. Insertion sort works by dividing the array into a sorted and an unsorted part. Initially, the sorted part contains only the first element, and the unsorted part contains the rest. The algorithm repeatedly takes the first element from the unsorted part and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted part.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to identify a loop invariant for the outer while loop. A loop invariant is a condition that remains true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\n### Analysis of the Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer while loop:\n```python\nwhile j <= len(arr) - 1:\n```\n- **Loop Invariant:** At the start of each iteration of the outer while loop, the subarray `arr[0..j-1]` is sorted.\n\nThis invariant means that by the time the outer while loop finishes, the elements from index 0 up to index `j-1` are in sorted order. This ensures that as the outer loop progresses, the left part of the array is always sorted.\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = arr[0->j-1]`"}]
