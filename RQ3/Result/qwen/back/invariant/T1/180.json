The algorithm works as follows:\n\n1. It starts with an unsorted segment of the array.\n2. In each pass through the loop, it finds the smallest element in the unsorted segment.\n3. It then swaps this smallest element with the first element of the unsorted segment.\n4. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to establish a loop invariant for the outer `while` loop, which iterates from `a = 0` to `a = len(arr) - 1`.\n\n**Loop Invariant:**\nAt the start of each iteration of the outer loop (`while a < len(arr)`), the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[a-1]` contains the smallest `a` elements from the original array, and these elements are sorted in ascending order.\n\n### Formal Representation of the Loop Invariant\n\nSince the loop invariant involves the state of the array up to index `a-1`, we can represent it as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:a]`\n\nHowever, since we need to express it in the format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we adjust our representation to fit the required format:\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:a]`\n\nBut since the exact function representation isn't straightforward due to the nature of array slicing, we can rephrase it slightly differently to maintain the intended meaning within the constraints provided:\n\n- `sorted_value = arr[0:a]`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n- `sorted_value = arr[0:a]`\n\nThis loop invariant indicates that at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop, the elements from index `0` to `a-1` are sorted and contain the smallest `a` elements of the array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    a = 0\n    while a <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = a + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[a]:\n                temp = arr[a]\n                arr[a] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        a += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided function `selection_sort` is an implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
