Insertion sort works by iterating through the array and growing a sorted portion of the array one element at a time. For each element, it finds the correct position within the sorted portion and inserts it there.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this algorithm using loop invariants, we need to define a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner loop. The loop invariant for the inner loop is typically that the subarray up to the current index `z` is sorted.\n\n### Explanation of Loop Invariants\n\nFor the outer loop:\n- The loop invariant could be that the subarray `arr[0:q]` is sorted after the `q`-th iteration of the outer loop.\n\nFor the inner loop:\n- The loop invariant would be that the subarray `arr[z+1:i+1]` is sorted after the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop.\n\nHowever, since the inner loop is nested within the outer loop, we need to focus on the specific behavior of the inner loop while considering the context of the outer loop.\n\n### Answer\n\nLet's consider the inner loop invariant:\n\nThe inner loop invariant is that the subarray `arr[z+1:i+1]` is sorted in ascending order after the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop.\n\nGiven that `i` is not defined in the provided code snippet, let's assume that `i` is the same as `q` from the outer loop context.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr_value = sorted(arr[q+1:q+1])\n``` \n\nThis invariant states that the part of the array being processed in the inner loop remains sorted after each iteration of the inner loop. However, for clarity and precision, we can refine this further if more context is available.\n\nSince the exact variable `i` is not clear from the provided code, a more precise invariant based on the given context would be:\n\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr_value = sorted(arr[q+1:q+1])\n```\n\nThis means the subarray `arr[q+1:q+1]` (which simplifies to just the element at `q`) is sorted after the inner loop iterations for each `q`. But generally, we would want to express that the subarray `arr[0:q]` is sorted after the outer loop iterations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    while q <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles\n\nThe provided code implements the insertion sort algorithm. The fundamental principle of insertion sort is to build a sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking the next element and inserting it into the correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the algorithm, we need to establish a loop invariant for both the outer and inner loops. \n\n- **Outer Loop Invariant**: After the `q`-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:q]` is sorted.\n- **Inner Loop Invariant**: After the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[z+1:q+1]` is sorted.\n\n### Explanation\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nAfter the `q`-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:q]` is sorted. This is because the outer loop iterates over each element in the array, and for each element, the inner loop ensures that it is placed in the correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nAfter the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[z+1:q+1]` is sorted. This is because the inner loop moves elements backward until they are in the correct position relative to the already sorted elements.\n\n### Answer\n\nGiven the context of the outer loop invariant:\n\n- The loop invariant for the outer loop is that after the `q`-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:q]` is sorted.\n\nGiven the context of the inner loop invariant:\n\n- The loop invariant for the inner loop is that after the `z`-th iteration, the subarray `arr[z+1:q+1]` is sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer for the loop invariant of the inner loop during the i-th iteration (where `q` is the current iteration of the outer loop) is:\n\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: arr_value = sorted(arr[z+1:q+1])\n``` \n\nThis means that after the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[z+1:q+1]` is sorted."}]
