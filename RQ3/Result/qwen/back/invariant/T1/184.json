In each iteration of the outer loop, the smallest element from the unsorted part is selected and moved to the end of the sorted part. The algorithm maintains this division throughout its execution.\n\n- **Outer Loop (`e`):** This loop runs from the start of the array to the end, gradually increasing the size of the sorted part.\n- **Inner Loop (`z`):** This loop searches for the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part.\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the `selection_sort` algorithm, we need to establish a loop invariant for both the inner and outer loops.\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, we can say that after the `e`-th iteration, the first `e` elements of the array are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[:e]`\n\nHowever, since we are asked to use the specified format, we can rephrase it slightly:\n- `sorted_value = arr[:e]`\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nFor the inner loop, we need to ensure that the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array (from index `e` to the end) is found and swapped with the element at index `e`.\n\nAfter the `z`-th iteration of the inner loop, the element at index `e` is the smallest element in the subarray from `e` to `len(arr)-1`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- `min_value = min(arr[e:z+1])`\n\nAgain, using the specified format:\n- `min_value = min(arr[e:z+1])`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nSince the question asks specifically for the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop, we can generalize the above invariants as follows:\n\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = arr[:e]`\n- For the inner loop: `min_value = min(arr[e:z+1])`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = arr[:e]`\n- `min_value = min(arr[e:z+1])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = e + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[e]:\n                temp = arr[e]\n                arr[e] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "### Fundamental Principles Involved\n\nThe `selection_sort` algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning of the unsorted part. The algorithm uses two nested loops:\n\n- **Outer Loop (`e`):** Iterates through each position in the array, treating the elements before this position as already sorted.\n- **Inner Loop (`z`):** Searches for the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array (from index `e` to the end).\n\n### Loop Invariant\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the `selection_sort` algorithm, we need to establish loop invariants for both the outer and inner loops.\n\n#### Outer Loop Invariant\n\nFor the outer loop, after the `e`-th iteration, the first `e` elements of the array are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the outer loop can be stated as:\n- `sorted_value = arr[:e]`\n\n#### Inner Loop Invariant\n\nFor the inner loop, after the `z`-th iteration, the element at index `e` is the smallest element in the subarray from `e` to `z`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the inner loop can be stated as:\n- `min_value = min(arr[e:z+1])`\n\n### Final Answer\n\nUsing the specified format, the loop invariants are:\n\n- For the outer loop: `sorted_value = arr[:e]`\n- For the inner loop: `min_value = min(arr[e:z+1])`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n- `sorted_value = arr[:e]`\n- `min_value = min(arr[e:z+1])`"}]
