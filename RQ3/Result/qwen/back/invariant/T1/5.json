For this function, the loop invariant should ensure that the `max_value` variable always contains the maximum value of the elements seen so far in the array.\n   \n2. **Initialization**: Before the loop starts, `max_value` is initialized to the first element of the array (`arr[0]`). This ensures that `max_value` is set to a valid starting point.\n\n3. **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the loop, if the current element (`arr[f]`) is greater than the current `max_value`, then `max_value` is updated to this new value. This ensures that `max_value` always contains the maximum value encountered up to the current index.\n\n4. **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `f` equals `len(arr)`.
