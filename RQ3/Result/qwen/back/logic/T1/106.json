From premises 5, 14, and 16, we know:\n   - Sam is a yumpus.\n   - Sam is a rompus.\n   - Sam is a lempus.\n   \n2. By premise 2, if Sam is a yumpus, rompus, and lempus, Sam is a sterpus.\n3. By premise 4, if Sam is a yumpus, rompus, and lempus, Sam cannot be a jompus.\n4. Therefore, Sam is a sterpus and cannot be a jompus.\n   \n5. From premise 11, we know:\n   - Sam is a zumpus.\n   \n6. By premise 9, if Sam is a zumpus, Sam is a jompus.\n7. However, from step 2 and step 3, Sam cannot be a jompus due to being a yumpus, rompus, and lempus.\n8. Thus, there is a contradiction if Sam were an impus.\n\n9. If Sam were an impus, by premise 10, Sam would be:\n   - A grimpus.\n   - A gorpus.\n   - A jompus.\n   \n10. From premise 12 and premise 13, we know:\n    - Sam is a dumpus.\n    \n11. From premise 8, if Sam is a grimpus, Sam is a dumpus.\n12. From premise 7, if Sam is a gorpus, Sam is a tumpus.\n13. From premise 4, if Sam is a yumpus, rompus, and lempus, Sam cannot be a jompus.\n14. Therefore, if Sam were an impus, Sam would have to be a jompus, but this contradicts the fact that Sam is a yumpus, rompus, and lempus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe contradiction arises because Sam cannot simultaneously be a jompus and not a jompus. Therefore, Sam cannot be an impus.\n\nThus, the final answer is: **(5),(14),(15),(16),(11),(12)->(17)**"}]
