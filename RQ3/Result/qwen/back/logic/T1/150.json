This doesn't directly help us prove that she is a vumpus.\n3. **Intermediate Conclusions**: We need to find out if Stella can be linked to being a grimpus, brimpus, or other types that can eventually lead to her being a vumpus.\n4. **Use Premises to Derive Intermediate Results**:\n   - From (9), Stella is a grimpus and a brimpus.\n   - From (7), every brimpus is a lorpus and a wumpus.
