From premise 2, every lorpus is a lempus, but we don't have a direct statement about jompuses being rompuses. However, from premise 10, each lorpus is a rompus. Since jompuses are lempuses (premise 4) and every lorpus is a rompus (premise 10), we can infer indirectly through the relationships, but let's focus directly on what we have.\n  \n- If Stella is a **lorpus**: From premise 10, each lorpus is a rompus. Therefore, if Stella is a lorpus, she is definitely a rompus.\n\n- If Stella is a **tumpus**: From premise 6, every tumpus is a rompus. Therefore, if Stella is a tumpus, she is definitely a rompus.\n\nThus, regardless of whether Stella is a jompus, a lorpus, or a tumpus, she will always be a rompus.\n\nGiven this, we need to find the minimal set of premises that allow us to derive that Stella is a rompus.\n\n**Minimal Set of Premises:**\n- Premise 10: Each lorpus is a rompus.\n- Premise 6: Every tumpus is a rompus.\n- Premise 4: Jompuses are lempuses (indirectly useful through other premises).\n\nHowever, since we have direct statements for lorpus and tumpus, and Stella can be either one of those directly leading to her being a rompus, we only need premises directly stating these relationships.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(10),(6)->(13)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

However, we do not have a direct premise stating that jompuses are rompuses. But since Stella could also be a lorpus or tumpus, we can proceed.\n- If Stella is a **lorpus**, premise 10 states that each lorpus is a rompus. Therefore, Stella would be a rompus.\n- If Stella is a **tumpus**, premise 6 states that every tumpus is a rompus. Therefore, Stella would be a rompus.\n- If Stella is a **sterpus**, premise 5 states that each sterpus is a rompus. Therefore, Stella would be a rompus.\n\nThus, in all cases, Stella is a rompus.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\n\nThe minimal set of premises required to prove that Stella is a rompus is:\n- Premise 10: Each lorpus is a rompus.\n- Premise 6: Every tumpus is a rompus.\n- Premise 5: Each sterpus is a rompus.\n\nSince Stella can be a lorpus, tumpus, or sterpus, these premises cover all the necessary cases.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(10),(6),(5)->(13)**"}]
