This indicates a contradiction unless we find another way to resolve it.\n\n3. **Examine the implications of Rex being a vumpus**:\n   - From (11), every vumpus is a lorpus. So Rex is a lorpus.\n   - From (10), numpuses are lorpuses. Therefore, if Rex is a lorpus, Rex could potentially be a numpus.\n   \n4. **Check Rex's potential to be a jompus**:\n   - From (6), every jompus is a wumpus, a dumpus, and a numpus.\n   - From (9), every wumpus is a tumpus.
