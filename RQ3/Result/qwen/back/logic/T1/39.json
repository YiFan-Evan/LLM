Specifically, we need to examine the possible scenarios for Max based on the disjunctions given in premises (11) and (12), and see if any of these scenarios guarantee that Max is a yumpus.\n\nLet's break down the premises:\n- Premise (11): Max is a jompus or a tumpus or a shumpus.\n- Premise (12): Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus.\n- We need to prove that Max is a yumpus.\n\nFirst, let's consider the implications of the premises related to yumpuses:\n- Premise (1): Grimpuses are yumpuses.\n- Premise (3): Shumpuses are yumpuses.\n- Premise (4): Every jompus is a yumpus.\n- Premise (5): Dumpuses are yumpuses.\n- Premise (7): Each tumpus is a yumpus.\n- Premise (8): Every brimpus is a yumpus.\n\nNext, let's look at the premises related to numpuses:\n- Premise (2): Tumpuses are numpuses.\n- Premise (6): Every shumpus is a numpus.\n- Premise (9): Lorpuses are numpuses.\n- Premise (10): Jompuses are numpuses.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possibilities for Max:\n1. If Max is a jompus (from premise 11), then by premise (4), Max is a yumpus.\n2. If Max is a tumpus (from premise 11), then by premise (7), Max is a yumpus.\n3. If Max is a shumpus (from premise 11), then by premise (3), Max is a yumpus.\n\nNow, let's check the other possibilities from premise (12):\n1. If Max is a lorpus, then by premise (9), Max is a numpus, but not necessarily a yumpus.\n2. If Max is a jompus (already considered above), then Max is a yumpus.\n3. If Max is a tumpus (already considered above), then Max is a yumpus.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that regardless of which of the options in premise (11) or (12) Max falls into, Max will always be a yumpus.

Let's carefully analyze the premises and how they relate to Max being a yumpus.\n\n### Analysis of Premises\n\n1. **Every mother has a son** (Premise 0) - This premise does not directly relate to the properties of yumpuses, tumpuses, or any other types of beings mentioned. It is irrelevant to our current goal.\n\n2. **Grimpuses are yumpuses** (Premise 1) - Irrelevant to Max.\n\n3. **Tumpuses are numpuses** (Premise 2) - Irrelevant to Max.\n\n4. **Shumpuses are yumpuses** (Premise 3) - Relevant if Max is a shumpus.\n\n5. **Every jompus is a yumpus** (Premise 4) - Relevant if Max is a jompus.\n\n6. **Dumpuses are yumpuses** (Premise 5) - Irrelevant to Max.\n\n7. **Every shumpus is a numpus** (Premise 6) - Relevant if Max is a shumpus, but we already know from Premise 3 that shumpuses are yumpuses.\n\n8. **Each tumpus is a yumpus** (Premise 7) - Relevant if Max is a tumpus.\n\n9. **Every brimpus is a yumpus** (Premise 8) - Irrelevant to Max.\n\n10. **Lorpuses are numpuses** (Premise 9) - Relevant if Max is a lorpus.\n\n11. **Jompuses are numpuses** (Premise 10) - Relevant if Max is a jompus, but we already know from Premise 4 that jompuses are yumpuses.\n\n12. **Max is a jompus or a tumpus or a shumpus** (Premise 11) - This tells us the possible types Max could be.\n\n13. **Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus** (Premise 12) - This also tells us the possible types Max could be, overlapping with Premise 11.\n\n### Combining Information from Premises 11 and 12\n\nFrom Premise 11, Max could be:\n- A jompus\n- A tumpus\n- A shumpus\n\nFrom Premise 12, Max could be:\n- A lorpus\n- A jompus\n- A tumpus\n\nCombining both premises, the possible types for Max are:\n- A jompus\n- A tumpus\n- A shumpus\n- A lorpus\n\n### Checking Each Possibility\n\n1. **If Max is a jompus**: From Premise 4, every jompus is a yumpus. Hence, Max is a yumpus.\n2. **If Max is a tumpus**: From Premise 7, each tumpus is a yumpus. Hence, Max is a yumpus.\n3. **If Max is a shumpus**: From Premise 3, shumpuses are yumpuses. Hence, Max is a yumpus.\n4. **If Max is a lorpus**: From Premise 10, jompuses are numpuses, and from Premise 9, lorpuses are numpuses. However, this does not directly tell us about yumpuses. Since we have no information linking lorpuses to yumpuses, we cannot definitively conclude that Max is a yumpus based solely on being a lorpus.\n\nSince the possibilities that Max is a jompus, tumpus, or shumpus all lead to Max being a yumpus, and the only possibility not covered by the premises linking to yumpuses is lorpus, we can still conclude that Max is a yumpus based on the given premises.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is a yumpus is:\n- Premise 4: Every jompus is a yumpus.\n- Premise 7: Each tumpus is a yumpus.\n- Premise 3: Shumpuses are yumpuses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (4),(7),(3)->(13)."}]
