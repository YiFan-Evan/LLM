From Premise (1), we know that being a vumpus, jompus, or dumpus implies being a rompus.\n2. From Premise (7), every zumpus is a rompus.\n3. From Premise (8), no lorpuses are rompuses.\n4. From Premise (10), Polly is a lempus, an impus, and a gorpus.\n5. From Premise (11), Polly is a tumpus, a lorpus, and a wumpus.\n6. From Premise (6), tumpuses are impuses.\n7. From Premise (4), every wumpus is a grimpus.\n8. From Premise (5), Polly is a zumpus.\n\nGiven that Polly is a zumpus (Premise 5), she must also be a rompus (Premise 7).\n\nSince Polly is a lorpus (Premise 11), and no lorpuses are rompuses (Premise 8), Polly cannot be a rompus. This is a contradiction because we have established that Polly must be a rompus (from her being a zumpus) and cannot be a rompus (from her being a lorpus).\n\nThus, Polly cannot be a vumpus since being a vumpus would imply being a rompus, and we have shown that Polly cannot be a rompus due to the contradiction introduced by being a lorpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the logical contradictions derived from the premises, Polly cannot be a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(5),(8),(10),(11)->(12)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
