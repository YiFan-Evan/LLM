Identify the relevant premises about Sally:\n   - Premise (13): Sally is a shumpus.\n   - Premise (18): Sally is feisty.\n   - Premise (10): Sally is shy.\n   - Premise (11): Sally is happy.\n\n2. Use the premises about shumpuses:\n   - Premise (1): Everything that is hot, temperate, cold, and a shumpus is a vumpus.\n   - Since the premises about shumpuses do not directly provide information about being happy, feisty, or shy, we need to focus on the combination of these traits and the fact that Sally is a shumpus.\n\n3. Check if there is any other premise that might help us directly conclude that Sally is a yumpus:\n   - Premise (4): Everything that is happy, feisty, shy, and a yumpus is a zumpus.\n   - We need to verify if Sally satisfies all conditions to be a yumpus. From the given premises, we know:\n     - Sally is happy (Premise 11).\n     - Sally is feisty (Premise 18).\n     - Sally is shy (Premise 10).\n     - Sally is a shumpus (Premise 13).\n\n4. Verify if Sally can be a yumpus:\n   - Premise (6): Everything that is slow, moderate, fast, and a dumpus is a yumpus.\n   - This does not directly apply to Sally since she is a shumpus, not a dumpus.\n\n5. Since none of the other premises directly lead to Sally being a yumpus, we need to use the given traits directly:\n   - Premise (4) states that everything that is happy, feisty, shy, and a yumpus is a zumpus, but it does not help us directly conclude that Sally is a yumpus unless we have all the traits and the specific category.\n\nSince we don't have direct premises connecting shumpus and yumpus through happy, feisty, and shy traits, we need to rely on the given traits and the category directly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(11),(13),(18)->(21)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

Now, we need to verify that Sally is also happy, feisty, and shy:\n- Premise (10): Sally is shy.\n- Premise (11): Sally is happy.\n- Premise (18): Sally is feisty.\n\nThese conditions are already given as premises. Therefore, we can conclude that Sally is happy, feisty, shy, and a yumpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove this is:\n- Premise (10): Sally is shy.\n- Premise (11): Sally is happy.\n- Premise (12): Sally is slow.\n- Premise (16): Sally is moderate.\n- Premise (17): Sally is a dumpus.\n- Premise (18): Sally is feisty.\n- Premise (20): Sally is fast.\n\nHowever, since we only need to show that Sally is happy, feisty, shy, and a yumpus, we can simplify this to:\n- Premise (10): Sally is shy.\n- Premise (11): Sally is happy.\n- Premise (12): Sally is slow.\n- Premise (16): Sally is moderate.\n- Premise (17): Sally is a dumpus.\n- Premise (18): Sally is feisty.\n- Premise (20): Sally is fast.\n\nBut since Premise (17) alone with Premise (6) suffices to establish that Sally is a yumpus, we can reduce it to:\n- Premise (10): Sally is shy.\n- Premise (11): Sally is happy.\n- Premise (12): Sally is slow.\n- Premise (16): Sally is moderate.\n- Premise (17): Sally is a dumpus.\n- Premise (18): Sally is feisty.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(11),(12),(16),(17),(18)->(21)."}]
