We'll start by analyzing the premises and the logical structure required to reach the conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Rex's Properties**:\n   - From premises (6) and (12), we know Rex is brown and orange.\n   - From premise (14), we know Rex is red.\n   - Therefore, Rex satisfies the conditions \"red, orange, brown\" in the second premise.\n\n2. **Determine Rex's Dumpus Property**:\n   - From premise (11), we know Rex is a dumpus.\n   - Premise (3) tells us that everything that is opaque, transparent, and a dumpus is an impus. However, we don't need this for our current goal.\n\n3. **Check Rex's Lempus Property**:\n   - To prove Rex is a lempus, we need to check if Rex satisfies the conditions of the first premise: \"melodic, muffled, discordant, and a dumpus\".\n   - From premises (13) and (10), we know Rex is melodic and muffled.\n   - From premise (8), we know Rex is discordant.\n   - From premise (11), we know Rex is a dumpus.\n   - Therefore, Rex satisfies all conditions of the first premise and hence is a lempus.\n\n4. **Combine the Conditions**:\n   - Since Rex is red, orange, brown, and a lempus, we can use the second premise to conclude that Rex is a shumpus. However, this is not part of the proof obligation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe key premises needed to derive the proof obligation are (6), (12), (14), (8), (10), (11), and (13).
