We'll analyze the relationships between the different types of entities and see if there's a chain of reasoning that leads us to conclude that Sally is a gorpus.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. From (9), we know:\n   - Sally is a jompus.\n   - Sally is a sterpus.\n\n2. From (1), we know:\n   - Yumpuses are sterpuses and jompuses.\n   - Therefore, since Sally is both a sterpus and a jompus, she must be a yumpus.\n\n3. From (3), we know:\n   - Every gorpus is a yumpus and a wumpus.\n   - Since Sally is a yumpus (from step 2), she could potentially be a gorpus if she is also a wumpus.\n\n4. From (10), we know:\n   - Sally is a vumpus.\n   - Sally is a rompus.\n\n5. From (7), we know:\n   - Rompuses are vumpuses and gorpuses.\n   - Therefore, since Sally is a rompus (from step 4), she must also be a vumpus and a gorpus.\n\nHowever, let's verify if we need any other premises or steps to prove Sally is a gorpus:\n\n- We already have that Sally is a yumpus (step 2).\n- We have that Sally is a vumpus and a rompus (step 4).\n- From (7), we know rompuses are gorpuses (step 5).\n\nBut we still need to confirm that Sally is a wumpus to satisfy the definition of a gorpus (step 3).\n\n6. From (6), we know:\n   - Vumpuses are grimpuses and lorpuses.\n   - Since Sally is a vumpus (step 4), she is a grimpus and a lorpus.\n\n7. From (8), we know:\n   - Each tumpus is a brimpus and a shumpus.\n   - But we don't have any direct information about tumpuses for Sally.\n\n8. From (2), we know:\n   - Each impus is a rompus and a tumpus.\n   - From (5), we know each zumpus is an impus, but we don't have information about zumpuses for Sally.\n\nSince we do not have any premises directly stating that Sally is a wumpus, we cannot conclusively prove that Sally is a gorpus based on the given premises alone.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10)->(11) (Not possible to prove with given premises)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
