Since Fae cannot be a rompus, Fae cannot be a grimpus.\n   - From (12), we know that every impus is a lempus. So if Fae were an impus, Fae would be a lempus.\n   - From (11), we know that wumpuses are lempuses. Since Fae is a wumpus, Fae is a lempus.\n   - Thus, if Fae were an impus, Fae would be a lempus, but since Fae is already known to be a wumpus and wumpuses are lempuses, this does not create a contradiction directly.\n   - However, we need to check the direct implications more closely. If Fae were a zumpus, it would imply Fae is a grimpus or an impus. Since Fae cannot be a grimpus, Fae could potentially be an impus, but this would not contradict any other given information.\n\n4. **Final analysis**:\n   - The key contradiction arises from the fact that Fae is explicitly stated to be a jompus, which implies Fae is a rompus, but we are told Fae is not a rompus.\n   - Therefore, Fae cannot be a zumpus because zumpuses include grimpuses and impuses, and we have contradictions in those possibilities.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(10),(13)->(15)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n   - (0) Every mother has a son. (This premise is irrelevant to the current problem.)\n   - (1) Each sterpus is a jompus.\n   - (2) Zumpuses are sterpuses, grimpuses, and impuses.\n   - (3) Fae is a jompus.\n   - (4) Each zumpus is a brimpus.\n   - (5) Each tumpus is a gorpus.\n   - (6) Grimpuses are tumpuses, yumpuses, and rompuses.\n   - (7) Every vumpus is a shumpus.\n   - (8) Yumpuses are dumpuses.\n   - (9) Grimpuses are brimpuses.\n   - (10) Jompuses are rompuses.\n   - (11) Wumpuses are lempuses.\n   - (12) Every impus is a lempus.\n   - (13) Fae is a jompus, a shumpus, and a numpus.\n   - (14) Fae is a vumpus, Fae is not a rompus, and Fae is a wumpus.\n\n2. **Fae's Attributes**:\n   - From (3) and (10), Fae is a jompus, and thus Fae is a rompus.\n   - However, from (14), Fae is not a rompus. This creates a contradiction if Fae were a jompus. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate Fae's attributes based on the given constraints.\n\n3. **Zumpus Analysis**:\n   - From (2), zumpuses are sterpuses, grimpuses, and impuses.\n   - From (1), sterpuses are jompuses.\n   - Therefore, zumpuses are jompuses (sterpuses), grimpuses, and impuses.\n   - If Fae were a zumpus, Fae would have to be one of these categories: jompus, grimpus, or impus.\n   - We already know Fae is a jompus (from (3)) and a shumpus (from (13)).\n   - From (6), grimpuses are tumpuses, yumpuses, and rompuses.\n   - From (5), tumpuses are gorpuses.\n   - From (9), grimpuses are brimpuses.\n   - From (4), zumpuses are brimpuses.\n   - Therefore, if Fae were a zumpus, Fae would be a brimpus.\n   - But from (14), Fae is a wumpus (and wumpuses are lempuses from (11)), and Fae is not a rompus.\n   - Since grimpuses are rompuses (from (6)), and Fae is not a rompus, Fae cannot be a grimpus.\n   - Also, from (12), every impus is a lempus, and Fae is a wumpus (which is a lempus), so Fae could be an impus, but this does not lead to a contradiction directly.\n   - However, the primary contradiction comes from the fact that Fae is a jompus (rompus) and not a rompus simultaneously, which is impossible.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - The main contradiction lies in the fact that Fae is both a jompus (and thus a rompus) and not a rompus.\n   - Therefore, Fae cannot be a zumpus, as zumpuses are jompuses (sterpuses).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(10),(14)->(15)"}]
