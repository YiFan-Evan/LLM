Let's break down the information step by step:\n\n1. **Stella's Characteristics**:\n   - Stella is orange (Premise 9).\n   - Stella is a grimpus (Premise 9).\n   - Stella is a lempus (Premise 9).\n   - Stella is sunny (Premise 10).\n   - Stella is a numpus (Premise 10).\n   - Stella is a zumpus (Premise 10).\n\n2. **Analyze the Premises**:\n   - From Premise 1, we know that lempuses and grimpuses are types of lorpuses.\n   - From Premise 2, we know that numpuses are yumpuses and zumpuses.\n   - From Premise 3, we know that dumpuses are sunny and numpuses.\n   - From Premise 5, we know that yumpuses are shy, wumpuses, and tumpuses.\n   - From Premise 7, we know that tumpuses are lorpus, rompus, and metallic.\n\n3. **Determine if Stella Can Be a Yumpus**:\n   - Since Stella is a numpus (Premise 10) and numpuses are yumpuses and zumpuses (Premise 2), Stella could potentially be a yumpus.\n   - However, we need to check if there are any contradictions or additional conditions that would prevent Stella from being a yumpus.\n\n4. **Check for Contradictions**:\n   - Stella is sunny (Premise 10). From Premise 3, we know that dumpuses are sunny and numpuses. This means Stella could be a dumpus but not necessarily a yumpus since yumpuses are shy (Premise 5), and there is no information indicating Stella is shy.\n   - There are no other direct contradictions that would prevent Stella from being a yumpus, but we need to confirm that there is no other condition that makes her exclusively a zumpus or a dumpus.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Stella is a numpus and numpuses include yumpuses, and there are no contradictions preventing her from being a yumpus, we can conclude that Stella could indeed be a yumpus.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Stella is a yumpus is:\n\n- Premise 2 (numpuses are yumpuses and zumpuses)\n- Premise 10 (Stella is a numpus)\n\nThus, the final answer is: **(2),(10)->(11)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

Let's analyze the premises step by step:\n\n### Analysis of Premises\n\n1. **Premise (0):** Every mother has a son.\n   - This premise does not directly relate to Stella\u2019s characteristics and thus is irrelevant to proving Stella is a yumpus.\n\n2. **Premise (1):** Lorpuses are orange, lempuses, and grimpuses.\n   - Stella is orange (Premise 9), a grimpus, and a lempus (Premise 9).\n\n3. **Premise (2):** Numpuses are kind and yumpuses and zumpuses.\n   - Stella is a numpus (Premise 10).\n\n4. **Premise (3):** Dumpuses are sunny and numpuses.\n   - Stella is sunny (Premise 10) and a numpus (Premise 10).\n\n5. **Premise (4):** Each wumpus is bright and a brimpus and a vumpus.\n   - This premise does not directly relate to Stella\u2019s characteristics.\n\n6. **Premise (5):** Yumpuses are shy, wumpuses, and tumpuses.\n   - This premise introduces properties of yumpuses.\n\n7. **Premise (6):** Shumpuses are opaque, transparent, and impuses.\n   - This premise does not directly relate to Stella\u2019s characteristics.\n\n8. **Premise (7):** Each tumpus is metallic and a rompus and a lorpus.\n   - This premise does not directly relate to Stella\u2019s characteristics.\n\n9. **Premise (8):** Zumpuses are earthy and jompuses and sterpuses.\n   - Stella is a zumpus (Premise 10).\n\n10. **Premise (9):** Stella is orange, a grimpus, and a lempus.\n    - Stella is orange, a grimpus, and a lempus.\n\n11. **Premise (10):** Stella is sunny, a numpus, and a zumpus.\n    - Stella is sunny, a numpus, and a zumpus.\n\n### Deriving Conclusion\n\nFrom Premises 9 and 10:\n- Stella is a numpus (Premise 10).\n- According to Premise 2, numpuses are yumpuses and zumpuses.\n- Therefore, Stella is a yumpus or a zumpus.\n\nSince Stella is also a zumpus (Premise 10), we need to check if there is any contradiction or additional information that would exclude Stella from being a yumpus. \n\nHowever, Premise 2 does not specify exclusivity between yumpuses and zumpuses within the category of numpuses. Hence, Stella can be both a yumpus and a zumpus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Stella is a yumpus is:\n\n- Premise 2 (numpuses are yumpuses and zumpuses)\n- Premise 10 (Stella is a numpus)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n**(2),(10)->(11)**"}]
