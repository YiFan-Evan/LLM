Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the key relationships between the different types of entities (e.g., impuses, sterpuses, brimpuses, etc.).\n2. Use logical reasoning to combine these relationships and deduce the necessary conclusions.\n3. Focus on the specific entities mentioned in the proof obligation (Wren).\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n#### Premises Analysis:\n- **Impuses**: Entities that are explicitly stated to be impuses (1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15).\n- **Sterpuses**: Entities that are explicitly stated to be sterpuses or related to sterpuses (2, 5, 7, 9, 12, 13).\n- **Brimpuses**: Entities that are explicitly stated to be brimpuses (2, 5).\n- **Wren**: An entity whose type needs to be determined based on the given premises.\n\n#### Key Premises:\n- (14) Wren is a yumpus or a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus.\n- (15) Wren is a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus or a brimpus.\n\n#### Combining the Premises:\n- From (14) and (15), we know that Wren is one of the following: yumpus, dumpus, tumpus, numpus, or brimpus.\n- We need to check if any of these types are guaranteed to be impuses.\n\n#### Checking Each Type:\n- **Yumpus**: (12) states that every yumpus is a sterpus. However, there is no direct statement that sterpuses are impuses, so we cannot conclude directly from this.\n- **Dumpus**: (9) states that each dumpus is a sterpus. (7) states that each tumpus is a sterpus. (6) and (13) state that numpuses are impuses. Since (8) states that dumpuses are impuses, we can conclude that dumpuses are impuses.\n- **Tumpus**: (7) states that each tumpus is a sterpus. However, there is no direct statement that sterpuses are impuses, so we cannot conclude directly from this.\n- **Numpus**: (6) states that numpuses are impuses. (13) states that numpuses are sterpuses. Since numpuses are impuses, we can conclude that numpuses are impuses.\n- **Brimpus**: (1) states that shumpuses are impuses. (2) states that each brimpus is a sterpus. (5) states that each brimpus is an impus. Therefore, brimpuses are impuses.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nSince Wren can be a dumpus, tumpus, numpus, or brimpus, and we have established that dumpuses, numpuses, and brimpuses are all impuses, we can conclude that Wren must be an impus.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (14),(15)->(16)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
