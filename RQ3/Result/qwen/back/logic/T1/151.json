Let's break down the logical steps:\n\n1. From premises (10) and (11), we know Alex is metallic and a lempus.\n2. From premises (3) and (11), since Alex is rainy (from (12)) and a lempus, Alex is a numpus.\n3. However, we don't need to go through all the intermediary steps for numpus. Instead, focus on the metallic property and other related properties.\n4. From premises (5) and (10), since Alex is metallic, Alex is a lorpus.\n5. From premises (7) and (10), since Alex is fruity (which we can infer indirectly through other properties or just take it as a necessary step), Alex is a rompus. But this is not needed for our final goal.\n6. From premises (4) and (12), since Alex is cold, Alex is a brimpus.\n7. From premises (8) and (15), since Alex is blue, Alex is a jompus.\n8. From premises (9) and (15), since Alex is small (which we can infer indirectly), Alex is a dumpus. But again, this is not necessary.\n9. From premises (13) and (6), since Alex is mean and a sterpus, Alex is a wumpus.
