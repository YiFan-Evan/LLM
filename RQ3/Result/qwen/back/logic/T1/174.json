Therefore, Sally would be a yumpus, which is consistent with premise (12).\n   - Also, based on premise (10), wumpuses are rompuses, grimpuses, and vumpuses. Thus, Sally would be a rompus, a grimpus, and a vumpus.\n   \n3. **Check the implications of Sally being a vumpus**:\n   - If Sally is a vumpus, then based on premise (5), since everything that is a grimpus, a gorpus, or a rompus is a vumpus, this means Sally would be a vumpus. However, this contradicts premise (13), which states that Sally is not a vumpus.\n   - Therefore, if we assume Sally is a wumpus, we reach a contradiction because it implies that Sally is a vumpus, which is false according to premise (13).\n\nThus, we conclude that Sally cannot be a wumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (3),(12),(13)->(14)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
