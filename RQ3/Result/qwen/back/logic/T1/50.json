Here are the key principles involved:\n\n1. **Logical Deduction**: We need to use logical deduction based on the premises to determine the attributes of Max.\n2. **Contradiction**: If we can show that a particular attribute leads to a contradiction with other premises, then we can conclude that the attribute does not hold.\n\nLet's break down the premises and see how they relate to Max and his attributes:\n\n- **Premise (1)**: Each lempus is not a yumpus.\n- **Premise (2)**: Max is a jompus.\n- **Premise (3)**: Everything that is a zumpus and a wumpus and a gorpus is a vumpus.\n- **Premise (4)**: Max is a zumpus.\n- **Premise (5)**: Each shumpus is a sterpus.\n- **Premise (6)**: Each lempus is a gorpus.\n- **Premise (7)**: Max is a gorpus.\n- **Premise (8)**: Everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a grimpus.\n- **Premise (9)**: Jompuses are yumpuses.\n- **Premise (10)**: Numpuses are vumpuses.\n- **Premise (11)**: Max is a wumpus.\n- **Premise (12)**: Everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a yumpus.\n- **Premise (13)**: Max is a vumpus and a dumpus and a jompus.\n- **Premise (14)**: Max is a shumpus, a lempus, and a numpus.\n- **Premise (15)**: Max is a zumpus.\n- **Premise (16)**: Max is a tumpus.\n\nFrom Premise (14), we know:\n- Max is a shumpus.\n- Max is a lempus.\n- Max is a numpus.\n\nFrom Premise (15) and Premise (16), we know:\n- Max is a zumpus.\n- Max is a tumpus.\n\nFrom Premise (13), we know:\n- Max is a jompus.\n- Max is a vumpus.\n- Max is a dumpus.\n\nFrom Premise (9), since Max is a jompus, Max is also a yumpus.\n\nFrom Premise (10), since Max is a numpus, Max is also a vumpus. This is consistent with Premise (13).\n\nFrom Premise (11), Max is a wumpus.\n\nNow, let's combine these:\n- From Premise (3), since Max is a zumpus, a wumpus, and a gorpus (Premise (7)), Max is a vumpus. This is already known from Premise (13).\n- From Premise (8), if Max were an impus, then Max would be a grimpus (since Max is a zumpus and a tumpus). But there is no information suggesting Max is a grimpus, so we cannot conclude this directly.\n- From Premise (12), if Max were an impus, then Max would be a yumpus. Since Max is already a yumpus (from Premise (9)), this does not lead to a contradiction.\n\nHowever, we need to check if Max being an impus leads to a contradiction. From Premise (12), if Max were an impus, then Max would be a yumpus. But from Premise (1), each lempus is not a yumpus. Since Max is a lempus (from Premise (14)), Max cannot be a yumpus.
