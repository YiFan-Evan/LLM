Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. From premise (6): \"Dumpuses are zumpuses.\" This tells us that if something is a dumpus, it is also a zumpus.\n2. From premise (9): \"Fae is a zumpus and a yumpus.\" This directly states that Fae is a zumpus.\n3. From premise (4): \"Every zumpus is a yumpus and a grimpus.\" Since Fae is a zumpus (from premise 9), we can infer that Fae is a grimpus.\n\nSo, based on these steps, we have shown that Fae is a grimpus.
