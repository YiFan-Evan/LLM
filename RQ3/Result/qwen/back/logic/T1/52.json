Identify the premises relevant to Stella being a brimpus.\n2. Use these premises to derive that Stella meets the conditions required to be a brimpus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n1. From premises (7) and (13), we know that Stella is both angry and amenable.\n2. To determine if Stella is a brimpus, we need to find out if she is also a rompus or some other type that could lead us to conclude she is a brimpus. However, we don't have any direct premises linking her to being a brimpus through other properties.\n3. Instead, let's look at premise (5): \"Everything that is hot and cold and a rompus is a brimpus.\" From premises (9) and (10), we know that Stella is both hot and cold. We also know from premise (8) that Stella is a rompus.\n4. Combining these, we can conclude that Stella is a brimpus because she is hot, cold, and a rompus.\n5. Since we already know from premises (7) and (13) that Stella is angry and amenable, we can combine these to conclude that Stella is angry, amenable, and a brimpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (14) is premises (7), (13), and (8).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (7),(13),(8)->(14)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
