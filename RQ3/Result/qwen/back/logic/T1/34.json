Since all these categories are subcategories of wumpuses, Sam must be a wumpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Sam is a wumpus is the combination of the premises that directly or indirectly establish that Sam belongs to one of the categories that are wumpuses. Specifically, we can use:\n\n- Premise 2 (Every lorpus is a wumpus)\n- Premise 7 (Impuses are wumpuses)\n- Premise 9 (Each tumpus is a wumpus)\n\nThus, the final answer is: \n**(2),(7),(9)->(13)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
