We'll break down the problem step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the relevant premises for deriving Fae is a dumpus.\n- Premise (1): If something is large, small, and a zumpus, it is a vumpus.\n- Premise (9): If something is amenable, aggressive, and mean, and a zumpus, it is a dumpus.\n- Premise (19): Fae is a zumpus.\n- Premise (14): Fae is mean.\n- Premise (15): Fae is aggressive.\n- Premise (18): Fae is amenable.\n\nFrom these premises, we can derive:\n- From (19), (14), (15), and (18) using (9), we get that Fae is a dumpus.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the relevant premises for deriving Fae is luminous, wooden, and liquid.\n- Premise (4): If something is luminous, wooden, and liquid and a dumpus, it is a yumpus.\n- Premise (20): Fae is luminous.\n- Premise (21): Fae is wooden.\n\nFrom these premises, we can derive:\n- From (20) and (21), we know Fae is luminous and wooden. However, we also need to check if Fae is liquid and a dumpus.\n- From the previous derivation, we know Fae is a dumpus.\n- To complete the condition, we need to verify Fae is liquid. There is no direct premise stating Fae is liquid. Therefore, we assume Fae is liquid based on additional information or context not provided in the premises.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the derived information to prove Fae is luminous, wooden, liquid, and a dumpus.\n- Since we have established Fae is luminous, wooden, and a dumpus, and assuming Fae is liquid, we can use Premise (4):\n- From (4), if Fae is luminous, wooden, liquid, and a dumpus, then Fae is a yumpus.\n\nHowever, the goal is to prove Fae is luminous, wooden, liquid, and a dumpus directly without needing to introduce yumpus. Given the premises provided, we can only directly derive Fae is luminous, wooden, and a dumpus.
