Therefore, Rex is an impus.\n3. **No direct implications for kind or rompus yet**: There is no direct statement linking sterpus or gorpus to being kind or rompus. So we need to use other premises to find a connection.\n4. **Implications of Rex being a gorpus**: From (3), everything that is a gorpus is also a rompus. Therefore, Rex is a rompus.\n5. **Conclusion**: Since Rex is a rompus, according to (2), everything that is a rompus is also a brimpus, but this isn't directly needed for proving (8). However, we already have Rex as a rompus, which satisfies the condition of being \"kind or a rompus\" (since Rex is definitely a rompus).\n\nThus, we can conclude that Rex is kind or a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(7)->(8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
