So, Polly being a gorpus means she is a sterpus or a wumpus.\n\n2. **Combine Information**: We need to check if Polly is a sterpus directly or if there is a way to derive it from other information. From premise 7, we know that each wumpus is a zumpus and a rompus. However, this does not help us directly with sterpus.\n\n3. **Use Direct Information**: Since Polly is a gorpus (premise 8) and gorpuses are sterpuses (premise 5), we can conclude that Polly is a sterpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (5),(8)->(10)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
