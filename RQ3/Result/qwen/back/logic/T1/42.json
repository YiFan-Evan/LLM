There are no direct contradictions or additional requirements from the premises that affect these attributes.\n\nSince Polly meets all three conditions of being a lempus (sweet, spicy, and a rompus), we now need to see if she also fits the specific combination of being dull and bright. However, the premises do not directly provide a rule that combines dull and bright with being a lempus.
