Gorpuses are shumpuses.\n2. Every zumpus is a vumpus.\n3. Every lempus is a wumpus.\n4. Every tumpus is a numpus.\n5. Brimpuses are jompuses and numpuses and zumpuses.\n6.

Alex is a lempus and Alex is not a numpus and Alex is a gorpus.\n\nFrom the above premises, let's derive some conclusions:\n\n- From (7): Alex is a tumpus.\n- From (4): Since every tumpus is a numpus, Alex is a numpus.\n- However, from (10): Alex is not a numpus. This creates a contradiction unless we consider the possibility that Alex cannot be a tumpus based on other premises.\n\nSince Alex is a lempus (from (10)), and from (3), every lempus is a wumpus, so Alex is a wumpus. Also, Alex is a gorpus (from (10)), and from (1), gorpuses are shumpuses, so Alex is a shumpus. Thus, Alex satisfies being a wumpus, an impus, and a shumpus (from (9)).\n\nNow, let's consider the definition of a brimpus:\n- From (5): Brimpuses are jompuses and numpuses and zumpuses.\n- From (10): Alex is not a numpus.\n- Therefore, Alex cannot be a brimpus because one of the necessary conditions (being a numpus) is not satisfied.\n\nGiven all the premises and the contradictions resolved, we can conclude:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (7),(10)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

Hence, Alex cannot be a tumpus.\n\n4. **Conclusion about Alex**:\n   - Given the contradiction, we must re-evaluate Alex's status.\n   - Alex is a lempus, a wumpus, a shumpus, and an impus.\n   - But Alex is not a numpus, which means Alex cannot be a tumpus.\n\n5. **Definition of Brimpus**:\n   - From (5): Brimpuses are jompuses, numpuses, and zumpuses.\n   - From (8): Each jompus is a grimpus.\n   - For Alex to be a brimpus, Alex must be:\n     - A jompus (and hence a grimpus).\n     - A numpus.\n     - A zumpus.\n\n6. **Checking Conditions for Brimpus**:\n   - From (10): Alex is not a numpus.\n   - Therefore, Alex cannot satisfy the condition of being a numpus.\n   - Even if Alex were a zumpus or a jompus, the numpus requirement would still fail.\n\n### Final Conclusion:\nGiven the contradiction and the requirements for being a brimpus, Alex cannot be a brimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (7),(10)->(11)."}]
