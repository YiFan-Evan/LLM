However, since Stella is neither a rompus nor directly linked to being transparent through any other means from being a brimpus or jompus alone, we need to see if there is any overlap or contradiction.\n\nHowever, the key premise that directly links to transparency is:\n- (10) Rompuses are transparent.\n- (6) Rompuses are sterpuses.\n- (22) Every sterpus is aggressive.\n\nSince there is no direct connection between being a brimpus or jompus and being a rompus, the only way to establish transparency is through the premise that connects Stella directly to being a rompus, but there is no such premise.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(24)->(25)**. \n\nThis means that while Stella being a brimpus (24) is necessary, it is not sufficient by itself to prove Stella is transparent without additional premises connecting brimpus or jompus to rompus.

However, there is no direct link between brimpus or jompus and rompus in the given premises.\n\nInstead, let's re-examine the premises more closely:\n- We know Stella is a brimpus (24).\n- From (2), every brimpus is a vumpus.\n- From (19), vumpuses are tumpuses.\n- From (21), vumpuses are grimpuses.\n- From (18), grimpuses are impuses.\n- From (8), impuses are not muffled.\n- But none of these directly connect Stella to being transparent.\n\nGiven the premises provided, there is no direct logical path to conclude that Stella is transparent based solely on her being a brimpus or a jompus. Therefore, we need to determine if there is any other way to connect Stella to transparency using the given premises.\n\nHowever, the premises do not provide a direct connection from brimpus or jompus to rompus or any other entity that is transparent. Thus, we need to rely on the available premises and logical deduction.\n\nGiven the premises, the only way to prove transparency is if Stella is a rompus, but there is no premise stating that Stella is a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(24)->(25)** is not possible with the given premises.
