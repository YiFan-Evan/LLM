This is because premise (4) states \"Max is small\" and premise (6) states \"Max is a gorpus\". There is no need to derive these separately since they are already given as individual facts about Max.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive (7) is (4) and (6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (4),(6)->(7)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
