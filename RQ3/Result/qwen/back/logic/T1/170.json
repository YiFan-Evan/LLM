This means Polly is a vumpus, which satisfies part of the proof obligation (12).\n\nHowever, to make sure we cover all possibilities, let's consider all three options in the disjunction (or statement):\n- Polly is a vumpus.\n- Polly is a shumpus (not mentioned in any premises, so we can't derive this).\n- Polly is an impus.\n\nSince Polly is a tumpus and tumpuses are impuses (premise 2), Polly is also an impus. Therefore, Polly is either a vumpus or an impus, which covers the disjunction in the proof obligation (12).\n\nThus, we can conclude that the premises needed to prove (12) are those that establish Polly as a tumpus, which then implies she is both a vumpus and an impus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (11)->(12)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
