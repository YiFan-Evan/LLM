Identify the properties of Alex:\n   - Alex is temperate and a jompus and a tumpus (Premise 9).\n   - Alex is orange, a lempus, and a gorpus (Premise 10).\n\n2. Use the properties of lempuses:\n   - Lempuses are floral, gorpuses, and sterpuses (Premise 5).\n\n3. Check if Alex qualifies as a lempus:\n   - Since Alex is a lempus (from Premise 10), it satisfies one condition to be a lempus.\n\n4. Check if Alex qualifies as a gorpus:\n   - Gorpuses are moderate and wumpuses and impuses (Premise 4).\n   - Alex is not directly described as a gorpus, but it is mentioned as a gorpus (Premise 10).\n\n5. Determine if Alex qualifies as a sterpus:\n   - From Premise 5, since Alex is a lempus, it must also be a sterpus because lempuses are defined as sterpuses.\n\nNow, let's identify the minimal set of premises required to derive the proof obligation:\n\n- Premise 5: Lempuses are floral, gorpuses, and sterpuses.\n- Premise 10: Alex is orange, a lempus, and a gorpus.\n\nBased on these premises, we can conclude that Alex is a sterpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (5),(10)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
