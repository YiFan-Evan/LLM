Since Wren is sweet, bitter, and sour, and also a yumpus, Wren could be a lorpus. However, this doesn't help us prove Wren is a dumpus.\n   - Premise (7) states that everything that is liquid, luminous, wooden, and a dumpus is a numpus. However, this tells us about numpus, not directly about dumpus.\n   - Premise (2) states that everything that is fast, slow, moderate, and a yumpus is a dumpus. Since Wren is fast, slow, and moderate, and also a yumpus, Wren satisfies all the conditions to be a dumpus.\n\nGiven the above analysis, we can conclude that Wren is a dumpus because it meets all the conditions specified in premise (2).\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - To prove that Wren is liquid, luminous, wooden, and a dumpus, we need to use premises (10), (11), (15), and (2).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(11),(15),(2)->(19)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
