Here\u2019s the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n   - Premises 1-5 define conditions under which certain entities are classified into different categories.\n   - Premises 6-7 tell us about Wren's attributes related to brightness.\n   - Premises 8-10 give us information about Wren's speed and nervousness/shyness.\n   - Premises 11-12 specify that Wren is a grimpus.\n\n2. **Deriving Intermediate Conclusions**:\n   - From Premises 6 and 7 (Wren is bright and dull), there is no direct classification for Wren based on these alone.\n   - From Premises 8 and 10 (Wren is slow and fast), we can see a potential connection to Premise 4 (slow and fast and an impus is a lempus).\n   - From Premise 9 (Wren is shy) and Premise 11 (Wren is nervous), we can see a potential connection to Premise 2 (nervous, shy, and a grimpus is an impus).\n\n3. **Connecting Wren to Impus**:\n   - Since Wren is already specified as a grimpus (Premise 12), and being nervous and shy makes it an impus (Premise 2), we can conclude that Wren is an impus.\n\n4. **Final Step**:\n   - To prove Premise 14 (Wren is slow, fast, and an impus), we need to combine the information that Wren is slow and fast (from Premises 8 and 10) and Wren is an impus (derived above).\n\nThus, the premises needed to derive Premise 14 are:\n- Premise 8 (Wren is slow)\n- Premise 10 (Wren is fast)\n- Premise 12 (Wren is a grimpus, leading to Wren being an impus via Premise 2)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(8),(10),(12)->(14)**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
