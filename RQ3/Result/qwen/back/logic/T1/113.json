From (12), we know Max is a dumpus.\n2. From (2), we know dumpuses are not numpuses.\n3. From (7), each tumpus is a numpus.\n4. Therefore, if Max were a tumpus, he would have to be a numpus (because tumpuses are numpuses).\n5. But Max is a dumpus, and dumpuses are not numpuses.\n6. Hence, Max cannot be a tumpus because being a tumpus requires being a numpus, which contradicts Max being a dumpus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBased on the above reasoning, we can conclude that Max cannot be a tumpus.
