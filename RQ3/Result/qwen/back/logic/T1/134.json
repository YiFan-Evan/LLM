Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n    - Premise (0): Every mother has a son. (Irrelevant to our current proof)\n    - Premise (1): Zumpuses are opaque, transparent, brimpuses, and tumpuses.\n    - Premise (2): Lorpuses are hot and temperate and cold and yumpuses. (Irrelevant to our current proof)\n    - Premise (3): Grimpuses are dull, bright, dumpuses, and zumpuses.\n    - Premise (4): Vumpuses are moderate and fast and grimpuses and numpuses. (Irrelevant to our current proof)\n    - Premise (5): Every numpus is blue and red and a shumpus and a lempus. (Irrelevant to our current proof)\n    - Premise (6): Dumpuses are floral and fruity and jompuses and gorpuses.
