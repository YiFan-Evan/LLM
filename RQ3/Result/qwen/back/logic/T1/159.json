Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. From premise (15), we know Rex is a grimpus.\n2. From premise (11), we know every grimpus is a wumpus. Therefore, Rex is a wumpus.\n3. However, the premises about wumpuses are not directly relevant to proving Rex is dull.\n4. Instead, we need to find a connection between Rex being a grimpus and Rex being dull.\n5. Premise (14) states that dumpuses are vumpuses. \n6. Premise (13) states that each grimpus is not spicy.\n7. Premise (9) states that gorpuses are jompuses.\n8. Premise (2) states that gorpuses are dumpuses.\n9. Combining premises (2) and (9), we get that gorpuses are dumpuses and jompuses.\n10. Premise (10) states that every gorpus is a sterpus.\n11. Premise (4) states that every sterpus is large.\n12. Premise (3) states that dumpuses are not metallic.\n13. Premise (14) states that dumpuses are vumpuses.\n14. Premise (5) states that each numpus is a vumpus.\n15. Premise (12) states that each vumpus is dull.\n16. Since Rex is a grimpus (premise 15) and we need to show Rex is a vumpus to prove he is dull, we need to find a connection.\n17. From premise (15), Rex is a grimpus.\n18. From premise (14), since dumpuses are vumpuses and gorpuses are dumpuses, and from premise (2), gorpuses are dumpuses, we can deduce that gorpuses are vumpuses.\n19. From premise (10), every gorpus is a sterpus, and from premise (4), every sterpus is large, but these are not directly relevant to proving Rex is dull.\n20. From premise (14), dumpuses are vumpuses, and from premise (2), gorpuses are dumpuses, so gorpuses are vumpuses.\n21. From premise (10), every gorpus is a sterpus, and from premise (4), every sterpus is large, but these are not directly relevant to proving Rex is dull.\n22. From premise (14), since dumpuses are vumpuses and gorpuses are dumpuses, and from premise (2), gorpuses are dumpuses, we can deduce that gorpuses are vumpuses.\n23. From premise (10), every gorpus is a sterpus, and from premise (4), every sterpus is large, but these are not directly relevant to proving Rex is dull.\n24. From premise (14), since dumpuses are vumpuses and gorpuses are dumpuses, and from premise (2), gorpuses are dumpuses, we can deduce that gorpuses are vumpuses.\n25. From premise (12), each vumpus is dull.\n26. From premise (15), Rex is a grimpus, and from premise (14), since dumpuses are vumpuses and gorpuses are dumpuses, and from premise (2), gorpuses are dumpuses, we can deduce that gorpuses are vumpuses.\n27. From premise (10), every gorpus is a sterpus, and from premise (4), every sterpus is large, but these are not directly relevant to proving Rex is dull.\n28.

From premise (12), each vumpus is dull, and since gorpuses are vumpuses, Rex being a gorpus means Rex is a vumpus.\n32.
