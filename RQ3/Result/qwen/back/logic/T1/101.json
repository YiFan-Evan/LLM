Let's break down the information step by step.\n\n### Premises Analysis:\n\n1. **Every mother has a son**: This premise does not directly relate to Wren or any specific characteristics of Wren.\n2. **Vumpuses are opaque and lempuses**: This defines the properties of vumpuses but does not directly involve Wren.\n3. **Each grimpus is feisty and a shumpus and a rompus**: This defines the properties of grimpuses but does not directly involve Wren.\n4. **Brimpuses are blue, yumpuses, and jompuses**: This defines the properties of brimpuses but does not directly involve Wren.\n5. **Lempuses are spicy and brimpuses and grimpuses**: This defines the properties of lempuses and indicates that they are also brimpuses and grimpuses.\n6. **Every yumpus is bright and a zumpus and a numpus**: This defines the properties of yumpuses but does not directly involve Wren.\n7. **Every jompus is temperate, a wumpus, and a tumpus**: This defines the properties ofjompushes but does not directly involve Wren.\n8. **Every wumpus is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus**: This defines the properties of wumpuses but does not directly involve Wren.\n9. **Wren is opaque and a lempus and a grimpus**: This provides direct information about Wren.\n10. **Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus**: This provides additional information about Wren.\n\n### Deriving Wren as a Brimpus:\n\n1. From premise (9), Wren is a lempus and a grimpus.\n2. From premise (4), lempuses are brimpuses and grimpuses.\n3. Since Wren is a lempus (premise 9), and lempuses are brimpuses (premise 4), Wren is a brimpus.\n\nAdditionally, from premise (10), we know Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus. This confirms that Wren is a wumpus (since every wumpus is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus, premise 7).\n\nHowever, to conclude that Wren is a brimpus, we primarily rely on the fact that Wren is a lempus and lempuses are brimpuses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (9),(4)->(11)"}]
