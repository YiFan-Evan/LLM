Let's break down the information step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant premises**: We need to find out which premises directly or indirectly contribute to proving that Alex is kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus.\n\n2. **Analyze the relationships**:\n   - From premise (1): If something is liquid, wooden, metallic, luminous, and a gorpus, then it is a sterpus.\n   - From premise (2): If something is kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus, then it is a vumpus.\n   - From premise (3): If something is bitter, sweet, spicy, sour, and a gorpus, then it is a lempus.\n   - From premise (4): If something is bright and dull and a lempus, then it is a tumpus.\n   - From premise (5): If something is shy, nervous, happy, feisty, and an impus, then it is a yumpus.\n   - From premise (6-9): Alex is wooden, liquid, metallic, and a gorpus.\n   - From premise (10-13): Alex is bitter, angry, spicy, and sour.\n   - From premise (14-17): Alex is luminous, kind, aggressive, and amenable.\n   - From premise (18-19): Alex is kind and sour.\n\n3. **Derive the necessary properties for lempus**:\n   - To prove that Alex is a lempus, we need to show that Alex has the properties bitter, sweet, spicy, sour, and is a gorpus.\n   - From premises (6-9), we know Alex is wooden, liquid, metallic, and a gorpus.\n   - From premises (10-13), we know Alex is bitter, sweet, spicy, and sour.\n   - Therefore, Alex satisfies all conditions to be a lempus (premise 3).\n\n4. **Derive the necessary properties for vumpus**:\n   - To prove that Alex is a vumpus, we need to show that Alex has the properties kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and is a lempus.\n   - From premises (14-17), we know Alex is luminous, kind, aggressive, and amenable.\n   - From premises (10-13), we know Alex is bitter, sweet, spicy, and sour.\n   - Since Alex is a lempus (as shown above), we can use premise (2) to conclude that Alex is a vumpus.\n   - However, the problem asks to prove that Alex is kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus, not a vumpus.\n\n5. **Combine the necessary premises**:\n   - We need to combine the premises that show Alex is kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus.\n   - Premises (6-9) establish that Alex is wooden, liquid, metallic, and a gorpus.\n   - Premises (10-13) establish that Alex is bitter, sweet, spicy, and sour.\n   - Premises (14-17) establish that Alex is luminous, kind, aggressive, and amenable.\n\nBy combining these premises, we can conclude that Alex is kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(13),(14),(16),(17)->(20)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
