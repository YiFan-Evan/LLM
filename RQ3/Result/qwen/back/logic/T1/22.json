Let's break down the logical structure:\n\n1. **Understanding the relationships**:\n   - A shumpus is a type of entity that many other entities belong to.\n   - Entities like rompus, tumpus, brimpus, dumpus, numpus, grimpus, zumpus, and lorpus are all types of shumpuses.\n   - Sterpuses are another type of entity, but not all sterpuses are shumpuses (only dumpuses, numpuses, and zumpuses are mentioned to be sterpuses).\n   \n2. **Analyzing Max's properties**:\n   - From premise (14), Max is one of the following: a numpus, dumpus, zumpus, or rompus.\n   - From premise (15), Max is one of the following: a lempus, numpus, dumpus, or zumpus.\n\nCombining these two pieces of information, we can deduce that Max is either a numpus, dumpus, or zumpus (since both statements overlap on these entities).\n\n3. **Using the premises**:\n   - Premise (2) tells us that every tumpus is a shumpus, but we don't know if Max is a tumpus.\n   - Premise (5) tells us that every dumpus is a shumpus.\n   - Premise (6) tells us that every numpus is a shumpus.\n   - Premise (11) tells us that every zumpus is a shumpus.\n   \nSince Max is either a numpus, dumpus, or zumpus, and all of these are shumpuses, we can conclude that Max is a shumpus.\n\n4. **Identifying the necessary premises**:\n   - To prove that Max is a shumpus, we need to show that Max is a numpus, dumpus, or zumpus.\n   - We need premises (5), (6), and (11) to establish that numpuses, dumpuses, and zumpuses are shumpuses.\n   - We also need premises (14) and (15) to establish that Max is a numpus, dumpus, or zumpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed is (5), (6), (11), (14), and (15).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (5),(6),(11),(14),(15)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
