Specifically, we need to determine which premises are essential for deriving the conclusion.\n\nHere\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Premise (0)**: Every mother has a son. This premise does not directly contribute to proving Polly's status as a brimpus or wumpus.\n\n2. **Premises (1) and (2)**: These premises establish conditions for something to be a yumpus. \n   - Premise (1): If something is a grimpus or a tumpus, it is a yumpus.\n   - Premise (2): If something is a wumpus or a brimpus, it is a yumpus.\n\n3. **Premise (3)**: If something is a wumpus or a brimpus, it is a gorpus. This premise establishes another condition but is not directly needed to prove Polly's status as a brimpus or wumpus.\n\n4. **Premise (4)**: Polly is not a yumpus. This is crucial because it means Polly cannot be a grimpus, a tumpus, a wumpus, or a brimpus (since all these lead to being a yumpus).\n\n5. **Premise (5)**: Polly is not a shumpus. This premise does not contribute to the proof of Polly's status as a brimpus or wumpus.\n\nGiven these considerations, the key premises needed to derive the conclusion are (4) and (1) or (2) because they directly relate to Polly's status as a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises that allows us to derive the conclusion is (4) and (1) or (2).
