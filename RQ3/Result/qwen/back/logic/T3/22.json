Let's break down the premises and see how they lead to the conclusion.\n\n### Premises Analysis:\n1. **If Max is a shumpus, then Taylor is a visionary.**\n   - This is a conditional statement. If the antecedent (Max is a shumpus) is true, then the consequent (Taylor is a visionary) must also be true.\n\n2. **Every rompus is a shumpus.**\n   - This means any object that is a rompus is also a shumpus.\n\n3. **Every tumpus is a shumpus.**\n   - This means any object that is a tumpus is also a shumpus.\n\n4. **Every brimpus is a shumpus.**\n   - This means any object that is a brimpus is also a shumpus.\n\n5. **Dumpuses are sterpuses.**\n   - This means any object that is a dumpus is also a sterpus.\n\n6. **Each dumpus is a shumpus.**\n   - This means any object that is a dumpus is also a shumpus.\n\n7. **Each numpus is a shumpus.**\n   - This means any object that is a numpus is also a shumpus.\n\n8. **Numpuses are sterpuses.**\n   - This means any object that is a numpus is also a sterpus.\n\n9. **Rompuses are sterpuses.**\n   - This means any object that is a rompus is also a sterpus.\n\n10. **Each grimpus is a shumpus.**\n    - This means any object that is a grimpus is also a shumpus.\n\n11. **Each zumpus is a shumpus.**\n    - This means any object that is a zumpus is also a shumpus.\n\n12. **Zumpuses are sterpuses.**\n    - This means any object that is a zumpus is also a sterpus.\n\n13. **Every lorpus is a shumpus.**\n    - This means any object that is a lorpus is also a shumpus.\n\n14. **Every lempus is a sterpus.**\n    - This means any object that is a lempus is also a sterpus.\n\n15. **Max is a numpus or a dumpus or a zumpus or a rompus.**\n    - This means Max must be one of these four types.\n\n16. **Max is a lempus, a numpus, a dumpus, or a zumpus.**\n    - This means Max must be one of these four types.\n\n### Deduction Process:\n- From Premises (15) and (16), we know Max must be one of the following: numpus, dumpus, zumpus, or rompus.\n- From Premises (7), (6), (11), and (2), we know:\n  - Each numpus is a shumpus.\n  - Each dumpus is a shumpus.\n  - Each zumpus is a shumpus.\n  - Every rompus is a shumpus.\n- Therefore, Max must be a shumpus because Max is one of the types that are shumpuses.\n\n### Conclusion:\n- Since Max is a shumpus, by Premise (1), Taylor must be a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (7),(6),(11),(2)->(17)"}]
