Premise (17) states that every gorpus is a lorpus. Therefore, since Stella is a gorpus, she is also a lorpus.\n3. **Lorpus Characteristics**: Premise (9) states that every lorpus is slow. Thus, Stella, being a lorpus, is slow.\n4. **Lempus Characteristics**: Premise (3) states that each lempus is a wumpus. Premise (1) states that lempuses are not cold. Premise (7) states that each tumpus is not loud. Since each lempus is a wumpus (and we don't have any direct information linking wumpuses to loudness or coldness), we focus on other properties.\n5. **Connecting Lempus and Gorpus**: Since Stella is both a lempus and a gorpus, we need to see if there's any connection between these classifications that could help us conclude about her size.\n6. **Sterpus Characteristics**: Premise (16) states that sterpuses are jompuses. Premise (18) states that every jompus is orange. Premise (11) states that lorpuses are sterpuses. Since Stella is a lorpus (from being a gorpus), she is also a sterpus. And since sterpuses are jompuses, Stella is a jompus. Hence, Stella is orange.\n7. **Yumpus Characteristics**: Premise (8) states that sterpuses are yumpuses. Since Stella is a sterpus, she is also a yumpus. Premise (14) states that yumpuses are not large. Therefore, since Stella is a yumpus, she is not large.\n\nCombining these steps, we can derive the proof obligation directly from the premises.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (19),(20),(11),(8),(14)->(21)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Stella is not large then Taylor is a visionary.
