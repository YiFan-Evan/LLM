Hence, we cannot use Premise 7 directly.\n\n6. **Premise 5** again:\n   - We already established that Alex is cold, hot, temperate, and a rompus.\n   - Therefore, by using Premise 5 again, we conclude that Alex is a tumpus.\n\n7. **Premise 5** one more time:\n   - We already established that Alex is cold, hot, temperate, and a rompus.\n   - Therefore, by using Premise 5 one more time, we conclude that Alex is a tumpus.\n\nSince we have already shown that Alex is cold, hot, temperate, and a rompus, we can now derive the final conclusion.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWe need to show that Alex is cold, hot, temperate, and a rompus.
