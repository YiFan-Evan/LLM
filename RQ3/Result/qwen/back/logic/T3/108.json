This does not help us directly with proving Polly is large or a grimpus.\n\nHowever, since Polly is already a shumpus (from (8)), and from (4), everything that is a shumpus can be a grimpus if it is earthy. But even without knowing if Polly is earthy, we still need to prove that Polly is large or a grimpus. \n\nSince Polly is a shumpus, and from (4), a shumpus can be a grimpus, we have:\n- Polly being a shumpus (8) + Polly being a grimpus (from (4)) implies Polly is a grimpus.\n\nThus, Polly is a grimpus, which satisfies the requirement of being large or a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation is (8) and (4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(4)->(10)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is large or a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.

From (10), Polly is a lempus. Using (3), we know that anything that is a lempus is a gorpus. So, Polly is a gorpus.\n3. Since Polly is a shumpus (9), we can use (5) to deduce that Polly can be a grimpus if she is earthy. However, we do not have any information about whether Polly is earthy. Nevertheless, we do not need this information directly to prove Taylor is a visionary.\n4. From (1), we know that if Polly is large or a grimpus, then Taylor is a visionary. We need to show that Polly is either large or a grimpus.\n5. From (9), Polly is a shumpus. From (6), if Polly is a shumpus, then she can be a grimpus because shumpus implies tumpus, and large or grimpus implies tumpus. Hence, Polly is a grimpus.\n6. Since Polly is a grimpus, by (1), Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation is (9), (1), and (5).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (9),(1),(5)->(11)"}]
