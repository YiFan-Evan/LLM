According to the given premises, we have the following logical structure:\n\n1. If Wren is a rompus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n2. We need to establish that Wren is indeed a rompus.\n\nLet's analyze the relevant premises:\n\n- **Premise (15):** Wren is a shumpus or a jompus or a zumpus or a brimpus.\n- **Premise (16):** Wren is a jompus or a zumpus or a brimpus or a tumpus.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can infer that Wren is one of the following:\n- A shumpus,\n- A jompus,\n- A zumpus,\n- A brimpus,\n- Or a tumpus.\n\nNow, let's check each case to see if Wren is a rompus:\n\n#### Case 1: Wren is a shumpus\n- From Premise (4): Each shumpus is a grimpus.\n- From Premise (12): Every zumpus is a grimpus.\n- From Premise (9): Each brimpus is a grimpus.\n- From Premise (10): Every tumpus is a grimpus.\n\nNone of these premises directly state that grimpuses are rompuses.

Therefore, we can conclude that Wren is a rompus.\n\n### Applying the Given Conditional Premise\n- From Premise (1): If Wren is a rompus, then Taylor is a visionary.\nSince we have established that Wren is a rompus, we can apply this conditional premise to conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Identifying Minimal Set of Premises\nTo prove that Taylor is a visionary, we need to identify the minimal set of premises that lead to this conclusion. The key premises are:\n\n- (1): If Wren is a rompus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n- (11): Each jompus is a rompus.\n- (2): Each zumpus is a rompus.\n- (8): Each brimpus is a rompus.\n- (5): Tumpuses are rompuses.\n- (15): Wren is a shumpus or a jompus or a zumpus or a brimpus.\n\nCombining these premises, we can derive that Wren is a rompus and hence Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(11),(2),(8),(5),(15)->(17)."}]
