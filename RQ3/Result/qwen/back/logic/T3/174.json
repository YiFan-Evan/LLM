However, this contradicts Premise (13), which states that Sally is not a vumpus. Therefore, there seems to be a contradiction unless we find another way to resolve it.\n\n5. **Premise (10):** Wumpuses are rompuses, grimpuses, and vumpuses.\n   - This means if Sally were a wumpus, she would have to be a rompus, grimpus, and vumpus.\n\n6. **Premise (5):** Everything that is a grimpus, a gorpus, or a rompus is a vumpus.\n   - If Sally were a wumpus, she would be a grimpus, a rompus, and a vumpus. But since wumpuses are grimpuses, rompuses, and vumpuses, and Premise (5) says everything that is a grimpus, gorpus, or rompus is a vumpus, Sally would indeed be a vumpus if she were a wumpus.\n\n7. **Premise (13):** Sally is not a vumpus.\n   - Since Sally cannot be a vumpus, and being a wumpus would imply being a vumpus, Sally cannot be a wumpus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can conclude that Sally cannot be a wumpus because being a wumpus would imply being a vumpus, which contradicts Premise (13).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(2),(3),(10),(11),(13)->(14)**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is not a wumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
