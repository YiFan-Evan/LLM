Since Sally is a dumpus (from 3), she is a rompus.\n- However, from (12), Sally is explicitly stated as not being a rompus.\n- This contradiction means Sally cannot be a wumpus because if she were, she would have to be a rompus, but she is explicitly not a rompus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove Sally is not a wumpus is:\n(1),(6),(8),(12),(13)->(15)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(6),(8),(12),(13)->(15)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is not a wumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
