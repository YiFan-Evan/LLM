Check which premises are required to establish these properties.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify the relevant property rules**:\n   - Premise (2): \"Everything that is fast and slow and moderate and a yumpus is a dumpus.\"\n   - Premise (7): \"Everything that is liquid and luminous and wooden and a dumpus is a numpus.\" This is not directly useful for proving Wren is a dumpus but helps later if needed.\n   \n2. **Check Wren's properties against the rules**:\n   - From the premises about Wren, we know:\n     - (8) Wren is sour.\n     - (9) Wren is slow.\n     - (10) Wren is liquid.\n     - (11) Wren is wooden.\n     - (12) Wren is fast.\n     - (13) Wren is bitter.\n     - (14) Wren is moderate.\n     - (15) Wren is luminous.\n     - (16) Wren is a shumpus.\n     - (17) Wren is a yumpus.\n     - (18) Wren is sweet.\n   \n   - To prove Wren is a dumpus, we need to verify Wren has the properties required by Premise (2):\n     - Fast: Wren is fast (from (12)).\n     - Slow: Wren is slow (from (9)).\n     - Moderate: Wren is moderate (from (14)).\n     - Yumpus: Wren is a yumpus (from (17)).\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Wren satisfies all the conditions in Premise (2), we can conclude Wren is a dumpus.\n\n4. **Additional Properties Needed for Numpus (though not required for Dumpus)**:\n   - Liquid: Wren is liquid (from (10)).\n   - Luminous: Wren is luminous (from (15)).\n   - Wooden: Wren is wooden (from (11)).\n\nThus, the premises needed to prove Wren is liquid, luminous, wooden, and a dumpus are:\n- (2) (the rule defining dumpus)\n- (10) (Wren is liquid)\n- (11) (Wren is wooden)\n- (14) (Wren is moderate)\n- (15) (Wren is luminous)\n- (17) (Wren is a yumpus)\n\nHowever, since the requirement is only to prove Wren is a dumpus, we need only:\n- (2) (rule for dumpus)\n- (9) (slow)\n- (12) (fast)\n- (14) (moderate)\n- (17) (yumpus)\n\nSince (10) and (11) are already given and necessary to show Wren is also a numpus, they are included in the minimal set.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(9),(12),(14),(17)->(19)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is liquid, luminous, wooden, and a dumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
