Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**: We need to focus on the premises that directly or indirectly relate to Polly and the types mentioned in the proof obligation (shumpus, vumpus, and impus).\n\n2. **Analyze Polly's Type**:\n   - From premise (11), Polly is a tumpus.\n   - From premise (2), tumpuses are numpuses, vumpuses, and impuses.\n   - From premise (6), anything that is a lempus, an impus, or a rompus is a sterpus.\n   - From premise (10), Polly is also a lempus.\n\n3. **Determine Types of Polly Based on Implications**:\n   - Since Polly is a tumpus, she is also a numpus, vumpus, and impus (from premise 2).\n   - Since Polly is a lempus (premise 10), she is also a sterpus (from premise 6).\n\n4. **Check if Polly is a Shumpus**:\n   - There is no direct information about Polly being a shumpus. However, the proof obligation asks us to show that Polly is a shumpus or a vumpus or an impus. Since Polly is already a vumpus and an impus (from the above analysis), the condition is satisfied regardless of whether Polly is a shumpus or not.\n\nGiven the above analysis, Polly is definitely a vumpus and an impus. Therefore, the statement \"Polly is a shumpus or a vumpus or an impus\" is true.\n\n**Conclusion**:\n- The premises needed to prove Polly is a vumpus or an impus (and thus the statement is true) are premises (10) and (11), which establish Polly as a lempus and a tumpus respectively. From these, we can derive Polly as a vumpus and an impus using premises (2) and (6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(10),(11)->(12)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is a shumpus or a vumpus or an impus then Taylor is a visionary.
