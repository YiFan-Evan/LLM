According to Premise 3, everything that is opaque, transparent, or a yumpus is a grimpus. Since Max is a yumpus, Max could be a grimpus, but this does not directly help us conclude that Max is a numpus.\n3. However, Premise 10 states that everything that is nervous, shy, or a yumpus is a vumpus. Since Max is a yumpus, Max could also be a vumpus.\n4. Premise 6 states that everything that is earthy or fruity or a vumpus is a numpus. If Max is a vumpus (as deduced from Premise 10), then according to Premise 6, Max is a numpus.\n5. Premise 6 also implies that if Max is a numpus, then Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus.\n\nSince Max is a yumpus, and from Premise 10, Max could be a vumpus, and thus by Premise 6, Max is a numpus, and therefore Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(10),(6)->(14)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
