Let's break down the information provided and see if we can derive the desired conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Premises Involving Impus**:\n   - From (3): \"Everything that is bright and dull and an impus is a grimpus.\"\n   - From (11): \"Everything that is small and large and an impus is a lempus.\"\n\n   We know from (15) that Max is an impus. From (13) and (18), we have that Max is dull and bright respectively. However, (14) and (16) indicate that Max is both large and small, which makes Max a lempus according to (11). But since (11) does not lead to grimpus, we need to check if there's another way to reach grimpus.\n\n2. **Combining Bright/Dull and Large/Small**:\n   - Since (11) leads to lempus and not grimpus, we need to focus on (3). From (3), we need Max to be bright, dull, and an impus to conclude he is a grimpus.\n   - We already have Max as an impus (from (15)) and Max is dull (from (13)) and bright (from (18)). Therefore, Max fits the criteria of (3).\n\n3. **Max as a Grimpus**:\n   - With (3), Max is a grimpus because he is bright, dull, and an impus.\n\n4. **Max as Loud and Discordant**:\n   - From (12), Max is loud.\n   - From (17), Max is discordant.\n\nSince Max is loud, discordant, and now confirmed as a grimpus based on (3), we can conclude that Max is loud and discordant and a grimpus.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (13),(18),(15)->(20)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is loud and discordant and a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.
