However, there is no direct information about Stella being earthy, so we cannot conclude anything from this premise.\n   - From premises (16) and (9), since Stella is bright and everything that is bright and a tumpus is a vumpus, we can infer that Stella is a vumpus because Stella is a tumpus (from premise (18)).\n   - From premises (17) and (2), since Stella is temperate and everything that is temperate and a vumpus is a wumpus, we can infer that Stella is a wumpus. But our goal is to prove that Stella is temperate and a vumpus, not necessarily a wumpus.\n\n3. **Combine the derived properties**:\n   - We have established that Stella is temperate (premise 17).\n   - We have also established that Stella is a vumpus (from premises 16 and 9).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (16),(9),(17)->(20)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Stella is temperate and a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
