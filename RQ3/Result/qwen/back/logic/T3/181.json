Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. From Premise (1), we know that Rex is a zumpus.\n2. From Premise (4), we know that every zumpus is a gorpus. Therefore, Rex is a gorpus.\n3. However, from Premise (13), we know that Rex is not a gorpus. This creates a contradiction if Rex were a zumpus. Since Premise (1) states Rex is a zumpus, we need to resolve this contradiction.\n4. Given the contradiction, let's re-evaluate Premise (13): Rex is a vumpus and Rex is not a gorpus and Rex is a rompus.\n5. From Premise (8), we know that rompuses are zumpuses. Therefore, Rex is a zumpus.\n6. From Premise (12), we know that Rex is a tumpus, a zumpus, and a yumpus.\n7. From Premise (6), we know that every jompus is a wumpus, a dumpus, and a numpus.\n8. From Premise (9), we know that every wumpus is a tumpus.\n9. From Premise (12), we already know Rex is a tumpus.\n10. From Premise (13), we know Rex is a vumpus and Rex is a rompus.\n11. From Premise (11), we know that every vumpus is a lorpus.\n12. From Premise (10), we know that numpuses are lorpuses. Since vumpuses are lorpuses, they could be numpuses, but we don't have enough information to conclude that Rex is a numpus.\n13. To prove Rex is not a jompus, we need to show that Rex cannot satisfy all conditions of being a jompus (wumpus, dumpus, and numpus).\n14. We know Rex is a tumpus (from Premise 12). If Rex were a jompus, then Rex would also be a wumpus (from Premise 6). But Premise (9) tells us that every wumpus is a tumpus, which Rex already is. So far, no contradiction.\n15. From Premise (6), Rex would also need to be a dumpus. From Premise (2), we know dumpuses are zumpuses. Since Rex is a zumpus, this condition is satisfied.\n16. Finally, Rex would need to be a numpus. From Premise (5), numpuses are gorpuses, grimpuses, and jompuses. From Premise (13), Rex is not a gorpus. Also, from Premise (7), grimpuses are sterpuses, but we don't have any direct contradiction here.\n17. However, the key point is that Premise (13) directly states Rex is not a gorpus. Since Premise (4) says every zumpus is a gorpus, and Rex is a zumpus, Rex cannot be a zumpus. But since Premise (8) says rompuses are zumpuses and Rex is a rompus, Rex must be a zumpus, leading to a contradiction if Rex were also a jompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(8),(13)->(14)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Rex is not a jompus then Taylor is a visionary.
