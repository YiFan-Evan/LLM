From Premise (3), we know every yumpus is a tumpus, so Max is a tumpus. From Premise (9), we know tumpuses are numpuses, so Max is a numpus. From Premise (12), we know numpuses are grimpuses, so Max is a grimpus. From Premise (14), we know every grimpus is not dull, so Max is not dull. \n\nFrom Premise (20), we know each sterpus is not large. Since rompus is a sterpus (Premise 10), rompus is not large. Since Max is a numpus and numpuses are rompuses (Premise 4 and Premise 10), Max is a rompus. Therefore, Max is not large.\n\nGiven Premise (1), if Max is not large, then Taylor is a visionary. Since we have established that Max is not large, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (4,9,10,12,14,20,24)->(26)."}]
