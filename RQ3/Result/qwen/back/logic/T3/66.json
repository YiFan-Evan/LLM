From premise (3), we know that everything that is temperate or a gorpus is a rompus. Since Rex is a gorpus, Rex could be a rompus if it were temperate.

To do this, we need to show that Rex can be a rompus or kind based on the premises.\n\nSince we already established that Rex is a sterpus, we can use premise (1) to confirm Rex is an impus.

This doesn't help us directly but gives us a hint that if Rex is kind or a rompus, it could be a brimpus. However, we need to stick to our goal.\n\nSince we know Rex is a sterpus (from premise 7), we can combine this with premise (3) indirectly by noting that if Rex were a rompus (which it could be because of its gorpus nature), then it would fit the condition of being kind or a rompus.\n\nThus, Rex is either kind or a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(7)->(8)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Rex is kind or a rompus then Taylor is a visionary.
