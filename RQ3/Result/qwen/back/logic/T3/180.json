However, since Sally is a rompus, it means Sally must be a numpus (by (7)). This contradiction indicates that Sally cannot be a rompus in the context of (12).\n\n3. **Using (12) to Derive Further Information:**\n   - Since Sally is a brimpus (from (12)), and each brimpus is a lorpus (from (4)), Sally is a lorpus.\n   - Since Sally is a lorpus, and if something is a lorpus, shumpus, or grimpus, then it is a vumpus (from (6)), Sally is a vumpus.\n   - Since Sally is a vumpus and yumpuses are vumpuses (from (8)), Sally is a yumpus.\n   - Since Sally is a vumpus and vumpuses include impuses (from (6)), Sally could potentially be an impus. But we need to check other constraints to confirm.\n\n4. **Checking Constraints on Impus:**\n   - From (5), if something is a sterpus, zumpus, or impus, then it is a shumpus.\n   - From (10), if something is a sterpus, zumpus, or impus, then it is a gorpus.\n   - Since Sally is not a numpus (from (12)), and numpuses include dumpuses, shumpuses, and wumpuses (from (9)), Sally cannot be any of these because she is not a numpus.\n   - Since Sally is a brimpus and brimpuses are lorpus (from (4)), and lorpus can be part of the vumpus category (from (6)), Sally could be an impus. However, we need to check if being an impus would make her a numpus, which she is not.\n   - From (5), if Sally were an impus, she would be a shumpus and a gorpus.

This creates a contradiction unless we re-evaluate the premises carefully.\n\n3. **Revisiting Sally's Properties:**\n   - From (12), Sally is a vumpus, lempus, and rompus.\n   - From (13), Sally is a yumpus, brimpus, and not a numpus.\n   - From (12) and (13), Sally is a vumpus and a yumpus.\n   - From (9), yumpuses are vumpuses, so this is consistent.\n   - From (13), Sally is a brimpus, and from (5), each brimpus is a lorpus.\n   - From (7), if Sally is a lorpus, then she could be a vumpus, shumpus, or grimpus.\n\n4. **Checking for Impus:**\n   - From (13), Sally is not a numpus.\n   - From (10), if something is a dumpus, shumpus, or wumpus, it is a numpus. Since Sally is not a numpus, she cannot be a dumpus, shumpus, or wumpus.\n   - From (6), if Sally were an impus, she would be a shumpus and a gorpus.\n   - From (11), if Sally were an impus, she would be a gorpus.\n   - From (10), if Sally were a shumpus, she would be a numpus, which contradicts (13).\n\n5. **Conclusion Based on Premise (1):**\n   - Since Sally is not a numpus (from (13)), and we have shown she cannot be a dumpus, shumpus, or wumpus, she must be an impus to avoid contradiction.\n   - Therefore, Sally is an impus.\n   - From (1), if Sally is not an impus, then Taylor is a visionary. Since Sally is an impus, the antecedent of (1) is false, making the consequent true.\n\nThus, Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove Taylor is a visionary is:\n- (1), (13)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(13)->(14)"}]
