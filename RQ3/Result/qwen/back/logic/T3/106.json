Instead, we need to show that the condition \"Sam is not an impus\" leads to the conclusion that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nGiven that Sam is a jompus (from (10)) and we cannot definitively rule out that Sam is an impus, we must rely on the contrapositive of premise (1):\n   - If Taylor is not a visionary, then Sam is an impus.\n   - Since we do not have evidence to prove Sam is an impus definitively, the only way to satisfy premise (1) is to assume Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (18) is:\n- (1) If Sam is not an impus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n- (10) Sam is a jompus.\n- (12) Sam is a zumpus.\n\nThus, the final answer is: (1),(10),(12)->(18)"}]
