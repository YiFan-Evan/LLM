Let's break down the logical steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**: We need to find out if Wren is one of the entities mentioned in the premises that are already known to be impuses.\n\n2. **Analyze the Proof Obligation**: We need to prove that Wren is an impus. To do this, we need to establish that Wren belongs to one of the categories defined as impuses in the premises.\n\n3. **Examine the Conditions on Wren**:\n   - Premise (14): Wren is a yumpus or a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus.\n   - Premise (15): Wren is a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus or a brimpus.\n\nFrom these conditions, we know that Wren is at least one of the following: a yumpus, a dumpus, a tumpus, a numpus, or a brimpus.\n\n4. **Check Each Possibility**:\n   - If Wren is a yumpus, then according to Premise (12), every yumpus is a sterpus. But we need to check if sterpus implies impus.\n   - If Wren is a dumpus, then according to Premise (9), each dumpus is a sterpus, and Premise (7) states that tumpuses are sterpuses. However, Premise (9) also states that each dumpus is a sterpus, and Premise (1) states that shumpuses are impuses. Since dumpuses are sterpuses, and sterpuses are impuses (from Premise (1)), Wren would be an impus.\n   - If Wren is a tumpus, then according to Premise (7), tumpuses are sterpuses, and since sterpuses are impuses (from Premise (1)), Wren would be an impus.\n   - If Wren is a numpus, then according to Premise (13), numpuses are sterpuses, and since sterpuses are impuses (from Premise (1)), Wren would be an impus.\n   - If Wren is a brimpus, then according to Premise (5), each brimpus is an impus, so Wren would be an impus.\n\nSince Wren must be one of the entities listed in Premises (14) and (15), and each of those entities is an impus based on the above analysis, we conclude that Wren is an impus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Wren is an impus is Premises (1), (7), (9), (12), (13), and (15).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(7),(9),(12),(13),(15)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is an impus then Taylor is a visionary.

However, sterpus does not directly imply impus unless we have more information.\n    - If Wren is a tumpus, Premise (8) tells us that tumpuses are sterpuses, and Premise (12) confirms that tumpuses are impuses. Thus, Wren being a tumpus implies Wren is an impus.\n    - If Wren is a numpus, Premise (7) tells us that numpuses are impuses. Thus, Wren being a numpus implies Wren is an impus.\n    - If Wren is a brimpus, Premise (6) tells us that each brimpus is an impus. Thus, Wren being a brimpus implies Wren is an impus.\n\nGiven the above analysis, we need to identify the minimal set of premises that ensures Wren is an impus. From the conditions given, if Wren is a tumpus, a numpus, or a brimpus, then Wren is an impus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises required to prove that Wren is an impus and thus Taylor is a visionary includes Premises (1), (8), (12), (13), (15), (16), and (7).\n\nThus, the final answer is: (1),(8),(12),(13),(15),(16),(7)->(17)"}]
