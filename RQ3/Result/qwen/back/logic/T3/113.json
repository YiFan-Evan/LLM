We will analyze the relationships between the different types of puses and determine if there is any contradiction if we assume Max is a tumpus.\n\nLet's break down the premises step-by-step:\n\n1. **Every jompus is a rompus.**\n   - This means if something is a jompus, it is also a rompus.\n   \n2. **Dumpuses are not numpuses.**\n   - This means no object can be both a dumpus and a numpus.\n\n3. **Every sterpus is a gorpus.**\n   - This means if something is a sterpus, it is also a gorpus.\n\n4. **Every impus is a shumpus.**\n   - This means if something is an impus, it is also a shumpus.\n\n5. **Brimpuses are numpuses.**\n   - This means if something is a brimpus, it is also a numpus.\n\n6. **Wumpuses are rompuses.**\n   - This means if something is a wumpus, it is also a rompus.\n\n7. **Each tumpus is a numpus and a sterpus and a wumpus.**\n   - This means if something is a tumpus, it must be a numpus, a sterpus, and a wumpus.\n\n8. **Max is a brimpus.**\n   - This means Max is a brimpus.\n\n9. **Dumpuses are rompuses.**\n   - This means if something is a dumpus, it is also a rompus.\n\n10. **Each tumpus is a rompus.**\n    - This means if something is a tumpus, it is also a rompus.\n\n11. **Max is a yumpus and a lempus and a shumpus.**\n    - This means Max is a yumpus, a lempus, and a shumpus.\n\n12. **Max is an impus and a dumpus and a jompus.**\n    - This means Max is an impus, a dumpus, and a jompus.\n\nNow let's combine these premises to see if Max can be a tumpus:\n\n- From premise 8, we know Max is a brimpus.\n- From premise 5, since brimpuses are numpuses, Max is a numpus.\n- From premise 12, Max is also a dumpus and a jompus.\n- From premise 1, since every jompus is a rompus, Max is a rompus.\n- From premise 9, since dumpuses are rompuses, Max is a rompus.\n- Therefore, Max is both a numpus and a rompus.\n- From premise 7, if something is a tumpus, it must be a numpus, a sterpus, and a wumpus.\n- From premise 10, if something is a tumpus, it is a rompus.\n- From premise 6, if something is a wumpus, it is a rompus.\n- Since Max is already known to be a numpus and a rompus, let's consider the sterpus part.\n- From premise 3, if something is a sterpus, it is a gorpus.\n- If Max were a tumpus, it would also be a sterpus and hence a gorpus.\n- But from premise 11, Max is a yumpus, lempus, and shumpus.\n- From premise 4, if something is an impus, it is a shumpus.\n- Since Max is an impus, Max is a shumpus.\n- There is no direct contradiction yet, but we need to check the consistency with the other properties.\n\nHowever, we still need to confirm the consistency with the dumpus property:\n- From premise 2, dumpuses are not numpuses.\n- Max is a dumpus (from premise 12).\n- Max is also a numpus (from premise 5 and premise 8).\n\nThis creates a contradiction because Max cannot be both a numpus and not a numpus simultaneously.

Let's analyze the premises step-by-step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Premise (1): if Max is not a tumpus then Taylor is a visionary.**\n   - This statement can be written as: \\( \\neg T_{\\text{tumpus}} \\rightarrow V_{\\text{Taylor}} \\)\n   - To prove \\( V_{\\text{Taylor}} \\), we need to show that \\( \\neg T_{\\text{tumpus}} \\) is true.\n\n2. **Premise (8): Each tumpus is a numpus and a sterpus and a wumpus.**\n   - This tells us about the properties of tumpuses but does not directly help us determine if Max is a tumpus.\n\n3. **Premise (9): Max is a brimpus.**\n   - From Premise (6), brimpuses are numpuses.\n   - Therefore, Max is a numpus.\n\n4. **Premise (13): Max is an impus and a dumpus and a jompus.**\n   - From Premise (5), every impus is a shumpus.\n   - Therefore, Max is a shumpus.\n   - From Premise (10), dumpuses are rompuses.\n   - Therefore, Max is a rompus.\n   - From Premise (2), every jompus is a rompus.\n   - Therefore, Max is a rompus.\n\n5. **Consistency Check:**\n   - Max is a numpus (from Premise (9)).\n   - Max is a dumpus (from Premise (13)).\n   - From Premise (3), dumpuses are not numpuses.\n   - This creates a contradiction because Max cannot be both a numpus and not a numpus.\n\nSince there is a contradiction in the premises regarding whether Max is a numpus or not, we can conclude that Max cannot be a tumpus. This is because being a tumpus would imply Max is a numpus, which contradicts the fact that Max is a dumpus (and thus not a numpus).\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   - Since Max is not a tumpus, the antecedent of Premise (1) is true.\n   - Therefore, according to Premise (1), Taylor must be a visionary.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** (9),(13)->(14)"}]
