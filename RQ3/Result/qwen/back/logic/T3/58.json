Specifically, premise (2) states: \"Impuses are small, large, jompuses, and sterpuses.\"\n\n3. **Determine if Fae can be a sterpus**:\n   - Since Fae is an impus (from premise (10)), and impuses are also sterpuses (from premise (2)), we can conclude that Fae is a sterpus.\n\n4. **Formulate the final answer**:\n   - We need to find the minimal set of premises that lead to proving Fae is a sterpus.\n   - The relevant premises are (2) and (10).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Fae is a sterpus is (2) and (10).
