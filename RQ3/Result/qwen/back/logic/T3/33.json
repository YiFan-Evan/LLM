We can summarize the relevant premises as follows:\n\n- (7): Each yumpus is a gorpus.\n- (8): Zumpuses are gorpuses.\n- (10): Each sterpus is a wumpus.\n- (4): Sterpuses are gorpuses.\n- (3): Each lempus is a gorpus.\n- (5): Each lempus is a wumpus.\n- (15): Wren is a yumpus or a zumpus or a sterpus or a lempus.\n\nFrom these premises, we can see that if Wren is any of yumpus, zumpus, sterpus, or lempus, Wren is a gorpus. Therefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove Wren is a gorpus is those that cover all possible cases for Wren.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Wren is a gorpus is:\n\n- (7): Each yumpus is a gorpus.\n- (8): Zumpuses are gorpuses.\n- (10): Each sterpus is a wumpus.\n- (4): Sterpuses are gorpuses.\n- (3): Each lempus is a gorpus.\n- (5): Each lempus is a wumpus.\n- (15): Wren is a yumpus or a zumpus or a sterpus or a lempus.\n\nHowever, since we need to identify the minimal subset that achieves the goal, we can reduce it to:\n\n- (7): Each yumpus is a gorpus.\n- (8): Zumpuses are gorpuses.\n- (10): Each sterpus is a wumpus.\n- (3): Each lempus is a gorpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove Wren is a gorpus is:\n\n- (7), (8), (10), (3) -> (16)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \\((7),(8),(10),(3)->(16)\\)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is a gorpus then Taylor is a visionary.

Specifically, Wren must be a yumpus, zumpus, or sterpus because these overlap in both statements.\n\n3. **Checking Gorpus Status:**\n   - (8) Each yumpus is a gorpus.\n   - (9) Zumpuses are gorpuses.\n   - (10) Sterpuses are gorpuses.\n\n   From these premises, we can conclude:\n   - If Wren is a yumpus, then Wren is a gorpus (by (8)).\n   - If Wren is a zumpus, then Wren is a gorpus (by (9)).\n   - If Wren is a sterpus, then Wren is a gorpus (by (10)).\n\n4. **Deriving Taylor's Visionary Status:**\n   - If Wren is a gorpus (which we have established based on the above premises), then by (1), Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe need the following premises to derive that Taylor is a visionary:\n- (1): If Wren is a gorpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n- (8): Each yumpus is a gorpus.\n- (9): Zumpuses are gorpuses.\n- (10): Sterpuses are gorpuses.\n- (15): Wren is a tumpus, a yumpus, a zumpus, or a sterpus.\n- (16): Wren is a yumpus or a zumpus or a sterpus or a lempus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises required to prove that Taylor is a visionary is:\n- (1), (8), (9), (10), (15), (16) -> (17)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \\((1),(8),(9),(10),(15),(16)->(17)\\)"}]
