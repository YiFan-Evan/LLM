Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus is a brimpus.\n2. Max is a yumpus.\n3. Max is a wumpus.\n4. Everything that is a sterpus, a numpus, or a shumpus is a grimpus.\n5. Everything that is a sterpus, a numpus, or a shumpus is a brimpus.\n6. Max is an impus.\n7. Every wumpus is a grimpus.\n8. Everything that is a dumpus, a numpus, or a vumpus is a rompus.\n9. Max is a lempus.\n10. Everything that is a yumpus, an impus, and a lempus is a vumpus.\n11. Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus is not a grimpus.\n12. Max is a yumpus.\n13. Max is a brimpus.\n14. Max is a tumpus.\n15. Max is a lorpus.\n\nFrom these premises, we can derive the following conclusions:\n\n- From premises 2, 12, and 14, we know Max is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus.\n- Using premise 1, since Max is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus, Max is a brimpus (premise 13 confirms this).\n- Using premise 11, since Max is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus, Max is not a grimpus.\n- From premises 2 and 12, we know Max is a yumpus.\n- From premise 3, Max is a wumpus, and from premise 7, every wumpus is a grimpus, so Max is a grimpus.\n- However, from premise 11, Max cannot be a grimpus if he is a yumpus, tumpus, and lorpus, which leads to a contradiction unless we consider other properties.\n- From premise 6, Max is an impus.\n- From premise 9, Max is a lempus.\n- Using premise 10, since Max is a yumpus, an impus, and a lempus, Max is a vumpus.\n- From premise 8, everything that is a dumpus, a numpus, or a vumpus is a rompus. Since Max is a vumpus, Max could potentially be a rompus but we need to check if he is a numpus.\n- From premise 11, since Max is a yumpus, tumpus, and lorpus, Max is not a grimpus. Therefore, the only way Max can be a grimpus is if he is not a yumpus, tumpus, and lorpus simultaneously, which is true here since he is a brimpus (from premise 1).\n\nNow, to prove that Max is not a numpus, we need to use the information that Max is a brimpus and not a grimpus. \n\nSince Max is a brimpus and not a grimpus, and since being a grimpus requires being a sterpus, numpus, or shumpus, and since Max is not a grimpus, Max cannot be a numpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(11)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is not a numpus then Taylor is a visionary.
