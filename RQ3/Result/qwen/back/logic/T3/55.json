So, Max is also a numpus.\n3. **Determine what a numpus is**: Premise (2) states that everything that is a wumpus or a shumpus or a numpus is a lempus. Since Max is a numpus, Max is a lempus. However, this fact is not needed for proving that Max is a vumpus.\n4. **Determine what a numpus is with respect to vumpus**: Premise (5) states that everything that is a wumpus, a shumpus, or a numpus is a vumpus. Since Max is a numpus, Max is a vumpus.\n\nSo, the key steps involve identifying that Max is a rompus (Premise 7), then deducing that Max is a numpus (Premise 1), and finally using Premise (5) to conclude that Max is a vumpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation is Premises (1), (5), and (7).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(5),(7)->(8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
