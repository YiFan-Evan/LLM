However, this doesn't help us directly with transparency or jompus.\n   - From (6): Since Alex is dull and a dumpus, Alex is a jompus. This is closer to what we want, but we still need to confirm transparency.\n   - From (2): Since Alex is transparent and a jompus, Alex is an impus. But we already know Alex is a jompus from (6), so we just need to confirm transparency.\n\n4. **Combine Information to Form the Final Proof:**\n   - We have established from (6) that Alex is a jompus.\n   - We also know from (8) that Alex is transparent.\n\nCombining these, we conclude that Alex is transparent and a jompus.\n\n**Final Answer:** Therefore, the final answer is: (8),(14)->(16)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Alex is transparent and a jompus then Taylor is a visionary.
