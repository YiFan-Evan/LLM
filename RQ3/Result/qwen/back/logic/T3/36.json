Let's break down the proof step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant premises**:\n   - Premises (1), (2), (3), (5), (7), (8), (10), (11), (13) directly state that certain types of pusses are vumpuses.\n   - Premises (4), (6), (9), (12) define relationships between other types of pusses.\n   - Premises (14), (15) describe the type of Wren.\n\n2. **Analyze the type of Wren**:\n   - From premise (14): Wren is either a zumpus, rompus, brimpus, or dumpus.\n   - From premise (15): Wren is either a sterpus, zumpus, rompus, or brimpus.\n\n3. **Combine the information about Wren's type**:\n   - Wren could be any one of the following: zumpus, rompus, brimpus, or dumpus.\n   - Since Wren is one of these types, we need to check if any of these types are vumpuses.\n\n4. **Check the relationships for each type of Wren**:\n   - **Zumpus**: Premise (4) states that zumpuses are shumpuses. Premise (11) states that every zumpus is a vumpus. Therefore, if Wren is a zumpus, Wren is a vumpus.\n   - **Rompus**: Premise (13) states that every rompus is a vumpus. Therefore, if Wren is a rompus, Wren is a vumpus.\n   - **Brimpus**: Premise (2) states that every brimpus is a vumpus. Therefore, if Wren is a brimpus, Wren is a vumpus.\n   - **Dumpus**: Premise (1) states that dumpuses are vumpuses. Therefore, if Wren is a dumpus, Wren is a vumpus.\n\nSince Wren is one of the types (zumpus, rompus, brimpus, or dumpus), and each of these types is a vumpus, we can conclude that Wren is a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(5),(7),(8),(10),(11),(13),(14),(15)->(16)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
