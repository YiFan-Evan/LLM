From **Premise 8**, we know Polly is a gorpus and a wumpus.\n2. From **Premise 7**, since Polly is a wumpus, she is also a zumpus and a rompus.\n3. From **Premise 5**, since Polly is a gorpus, she is also a sterpus and a wumpus.\n4. From **Premise 1**, since Polly is a sterpus, she is a shumpus and a grimpus.\n5.
