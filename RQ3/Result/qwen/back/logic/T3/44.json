To prove the conclusion, we need to show that Alex is not a brimpus.\n\n2. **Gorpuses are shumpuses.**\n   - This establishes a relationship between gorpuses and shumpuses.\n\n3. **Every zumpus is a vumpus.**\n   - This establishes a relationship between zumpuses and vumpuses.\n\n4. **Every lempus is a wumpus.**\n   - This establishes a relationship between lempuses and wumpuses.\n\n5. **Every tumpus is a numpus.**\n   - This establishes a relationship between tumpuses and numpuses.\n\n6. **Brimpuses are jompuses and numpuses and zumpuses.**\n   - This establishes the properties of brimpuses.\n\n7. **Every brimpus is a shumpus.**\n   - This establishes that brimpuses are shumpuses.\n\n8. **Alex is a tumpus.**\n   - This tells us that Alex is a tumpus.\n\n9. **Each jompus is a grimpus.**\n   - This establishes a relationship betweenjomputs and grimpuses.\n\n10. **Alex is a wumpus, an impus, and a shumpus.**\n    - This tells us the properties of Alex.\n\n11. **Alex is a lempus and Alex is not a numpus and Alex is a gorpus.**\n    - This provides additional properties of Alex, specifically that Alex is a lempus and a gorpus but not a numpus.\n\n### Deriving the Conclusion:\n- From premise 8, Alex is a tumpus.\n- From premise 5, every tumpus is a numpus. Hence, Alex should be a numpus.\n- However, from premise 11, Alex is not a numpus.\n- This creates a contradiction, indicating that Alex cannot be a tumpus under these conditions.\n\nSince Alex is not a tumpus, Alex cannot be a numpus (as per premise 5).\n\nNow, let's revisit premise 1:\n- If Alex is not a brimpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n- We need to show that Alex is not a brimpus.\n\nFrom premise 6, brimpuses are jompuses, numpuses, and zumpuses.\n- Since Alex is not a numpus (from premise 11), Alex cannot be a brimpus (as brimpuses must be numpuses).\n\nTherefore, since Alex is not a brimpus, according to premise 1, Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(11)->(12)."}]
