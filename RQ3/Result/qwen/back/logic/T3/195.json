Since Sam is a zumpus, Sam is also a dumpus.\n3. **Link dumpus to other properties**: Premise (2) states that dumpuses are jompuses. So, since Sam is a dumpus, Sam is also a jompus.\n4. **Link jompus to other properties**: Premise (7) states that each jompus is a vumpus. So, since Sam is a jompus, Sam is also a vumpus.\n5. **Link vumpus to other properties**: Premise (21) states that vumpuses are not rainy. This doesn't directly help us with bitterness but is part of the chain of reasoning.\n6. **Link jompus to numpus**: Premise (16) states that each jompus is a numpus. So, since Sam is a jompus, Sam is also a numpus.\n7. **Link numpus to impus**: Premise (22) states that every numpus is an impus.
