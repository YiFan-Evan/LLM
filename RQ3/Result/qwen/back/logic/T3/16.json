Since Rex is a grimpus and a lempus, Rex is also a vumpus.\n- From Premise 1: Every sterpus is an impus and a vumpus. Since Rex is a vumpus, Rex could be a sterpus if we can show Rex is an impus.\n- From Premise 10: Rex is a brimpus and a dumpus.\n- From Premise 4: Each dumpus is a brimpus and a sterpus. Since Rex is a dumpus, Rex is also a sterpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Rex is a sterpus is Premises 9 and 10.
