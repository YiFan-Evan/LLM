It seems irrelevant unless there is some hidden relationship, but we will focus on the relevant premises.\n\nGiven that Alex is not a numpus, we need to use premises 1, 3, and 4 to derive information about Alex.\n\nFrom Premise 3:\n- If Alex were a lorpus or a grimpus, then Alex would be a numpus. \n- But since Alex is not a numpus (Premise 4), Alex cannot be both a lorpus and a grimpus.\n\nFrom Premise 1:\n- If Alex were a lorpus or a grimpus, then Alex would be a jompus. \n- However, this does not provide direct information about numpus status but reinforces that being a lorpus or grimpus implies numpus status.\n\nCombining Premises 3 and 4, we conclude:\n- Since Alex is not a numpus, Alex cannot be a lorpus or a grimpus. \n\nThus, Alex cannot be a grimpus or a lorpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(3),(4)->(6)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Alex is not a grimpus and Alex is not a lorpus then Taylor is a visionary.
