Let's break down the premises and see how they relate to Sam being a wumpus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Sam is a jompus or a tumpus or an impus.**\n   - From premise (5): Every jompus is a vumpus.\n   - From premise (6): Impuses are vumpuses.\n   - From premise (8): Each tumpus is a vumpus.\n   - From premise (4): Lorpuses are vumpuses.\n   - However, none of these premises directly state that a vumpus is a wumpus.\n\n2. **Sam is a tumpus, an impus, or a lorpus.**\n   - From premise (9): Each tumpus is a wumpus.\n   - From premise (7): Impuses are wumpuses.\n   - From premise (2): Every lorpus is a wumpus.\n   \n   Therefore, if Sam is any of these three (a tumpus, an impus, or a lorpus), then Sam is a wumpus.\n\n### Derivation:\n- To prove that Sam is a wumpus, we need to use premise (11) or (12).\n- Premise (11) tells us Sam is a jompus, tumpus, or impus. But we need to check if being a jompus guarantees being a wumpus. We don't have that direct link.\n- Premise (12) states Sam is a tumpus, impus, or lorpus. From (9), (7), and (2), we know that all these cases imply Sam is a wumpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWe need premises (12) and (2), (7), and (9) to derive that Sam is a wumpus.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (12),(2),(7),(9)->(13)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sam is a wumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
