Alternatively, according to premise (12), Stella could be a tumpus, a brimpus, or a jompus.\n3. **Deriving wumpus status from identities**:\n    - From premise (1), we know that each brimpus is a wumpus.\n    - From premise (2), we know that every jompus is a wumpus.\n    - From premise (7), we know that numpuses are wumpuses.\n    - From premise (8), we know that tumpuses are rompuses.\n    - From premise (6), we know that each brimpus is a rompus.\n    - From premise (10), we know that every numpus is a rompus.\n    - From premise (9), we know that every jompus is a rompus.\n4. **Combining information**:\n    - If Stella is a brimpus, she is a wumpus (premise 1).\n    - If Stella is a jompus, she is a wumpus (premise 2).\n    - If Stella is a numpus, she is a wumpus (premise 7).\n    - If Stella is a tumpus, since tumpuses are rompuses (premise 8), and all brimpuses, jompuses, and numpuses are rompuses, we can infer that tumpuses are also wumpuses because they are rompuses and brimpuses/jompuses/numpuses are wumpuses.\n\nSo, regardless of whether Stella is a brimpus, jompus, numpus, or tumpus, she will always be a wumpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Stella is a wumpus involves premises that define the relationships between the types of corpuses and the fact that Stella is one of these types.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(2),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(12)->(13)**. \n\nThis means we need premises (1), (2), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), and (12) to prove that Stella is a wumpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Stella is a wumpus then Taylor is a visionary.

Let's break down the logical steps required to reach this conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Reasoning\n\n1. **Premises Involving Stella's Identity**:\n   - Premise (12): Stella is a brimpus or a jompus or a numpus.\n   - Premise (13): Stella is a tumpus, a brimpus, or a jompus.\n\n2. **Stella's Possible Identities**:\n   - From premise (12), Stella could be a brimpus, jompus, or numpus.\n   - From premise (13), Stella could be a tumpus, brimpus, or jompus.\n\nSince both premises (12) and (13) include \"brimpus\" and \"jompus\", we can conclude that Stella must be either a brimpus, jompus, or tumpus.\n\n3. **Relationship Between Stella and Wumpus**:\n   - Premise (2): Each brimpus is a wumpus.\n   - Premise (3): Every jompus is a wumpus.\n   - Premise (9): Tumpuses are rompuses.\n   - Premise (10): Jompuses are rompuses.\n   - Premise (7): Each brimpus is a rompus.\n   \nFrom these premises, we see that:\n   - If Stella is a brimpus, she is a wumpus (premise 2).\n   - If Stella is a jompus, she is a wumpus (premise 3).\n   - If Stella is a tumpus, she is a rompus (premise 9), and since jompuses are rompuses (premise 10) and brimpuses are rompuses (premise 7), tumpuses could also be wumpuses (though not explicitly stated, it follows from the structure).\n\n4. **Using Premise (1)**:\n   - Premise (1): If Stella is a wumpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n   \nIf Stella is a brimpus, jompus, or tumpus (all of which are wumpuses or could be wumpuses), then Stella must be a wumpus. Hence, Taylor must be a visionary.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe need premises (1), (2), (3), (7), (9), (10), (12), and (13) to prove that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(2),(3),(7),(9),(10),(12),(13)->(14)**."}]
