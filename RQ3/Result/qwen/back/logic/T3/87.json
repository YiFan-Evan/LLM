However, we don't need this property directly for our goal.\n   - Since Sally is a brimpus, we can use other premises involving brimpus to find more properties about Sally.\n\n3. **Use premise (5)**:\n   - Premise (5): Everything that is rainy or a brimpus is a vumpus.\n   - Since Sally is a brimpus, if she were also rainy, she would be a vumpus.
