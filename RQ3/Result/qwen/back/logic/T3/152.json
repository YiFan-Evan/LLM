Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Identify the relevant premises that link Sally to the property of being dull.\n2. Use the premises to establish the necessary connections.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Sally's Identity**:\n   - From premise (15): \"Sally is a numpus.\"\n   - From premise (16): \"Sally is a grimpus.\"\n\n2. **Relationship Between Numpuses and Jompuses**:\n   - Premise (8): \"Numpuses are gorpuses.\"\n   - Premise (9): \"Every numpus is hot.\" \n     - Since Sally is a numpus, Sally is hot.\n   \n3. **Relationship Between Grimpuses and Other Entities**:\n   - Premise (1): \"Grimpuses are fast.\"\n   - Premise (4): \"Every grimpus is a brimpus.\"\n     - Therefore, since Sally is a grimpus, she is also a brimpus.\n   - Premise (7): \"Every brimpus is not metallic.\"\n     - Since Sally is a brimpus, she is not metallic.\n   - Premise (10): \"Every brimpus is a yumpus.\"\n     - Therefore, since Sally is a brimpus, she is a yumpus.\n   - Premise (3): \"Every yumpus is windy.\"\n     - Therefore, since Sally is a yumpus, she is windy.\n   - Premise (12): \"Grimpuses are sterpuses.\"\n     - Therefore, since Sally is a grimpus, she is a sterpus.\n   - Premise (11): \"Sterpuses are not sweet.\"\n     - Therefore, since Sally is a sterpus, she is not sweet.\n\n4. **Relationship Between Brimpuses and Rompuses**:\n   - Premise (13): \"Every brimpus is a rompus.\"\n     - Therefore, since Sally is a brimpus, she is a rompus.\n   - Premise (5): \"Every rompus is a jompus.\"\n     - Therefore, since Sally is a rompus, she is a jompus.\n   - Premise (2): \"Rompuses are dull.\"\n     - Therefore, since Sally is a rompus, she is dull.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe key step here is linking Sally to being a rompus through the chain of relationships established by the premises. Specifically, Sally being a grimpus leads to her being a brimpus, and then a rompus, which directly makes her dull according to premise (2).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(4),(10),(13),(2)->(17)**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is dull then Taylor is a visionary.
