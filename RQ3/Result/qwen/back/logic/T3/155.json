Let's break down the relevant premises step-by-step:\n\n1. **Premise (1):** If Rex is not a lempus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n2. **Premise (2):** Rex is a lorpus.\n3. **Premise (9):** Everything that is a vumpus, numpus, and yumpus is a lorpus.\n4. **Premise (16):** Rex is a vumpus.\n5. **Premise (19):** Rex is a vumpus.\n6. **Premise (20):** Rex is a numpus.\n7. **Premise (21):** Rex is a yumpus.\n8. **Premise (7):** Everything that is a vumpus, numpus, and yumpus is a shumpus.\n9. **Premise (14):** Shumpuses are not impuses.\n10. **Premise (13):** Rex is a sterpus.\n11. **Premise (5):** Each sterpus is an impus.\n12. **Premise (12):** Lempuses are wumpuses.\n13. **Premise (3):** Every wumpus is a lempus, gorpus, and impus.\n14. **Premise (17):** Each lempus is a dumpus.\n15. **Premise (11):** Rex is a dumpus.\n\nNow let's analyze these premises step-by-step:\n\n- From Premises (16), (20), and (21), we can infer from Premise (9) that Rex is a shumpus because he is a vumpus, numpus, and yumpus.\n- Since Rex is a shumpus (from the above inference) and Premise (14) states that shumpuses are not impuses, Rex cannot be an impus.\n- From Premise (13), Rex is a sterpus, and Premise (5) states that each sterpus is an impus. This means Rex must be an impus.\n- However, we have a contradiction here because Rex cannot be both an impus and not an impus. Therefore, Rex cannot be a sterpus if he is a shumpus.\n\nGiven this contradiction, we need to consider the implications for Rex being a lempus:\n- From Premise (12), if Rex were a lempus, he would be a wumpus.\n- From Premise (3), if Rex were a wumpus, he would be a lempus, gorpus, and impus.\n- Since Rex is a shumpus and shumpuses are not impuses, Rex cannot be a wumpus or a lempus.\n\nThus, Rex is not a lempus. Given Premise (1), if Rex is not a lempus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Final Answer\n(1),(2),(16),(19),(20),(21)->(22)"}]
