If Max is a jompus (Premise 4 states every jompus is a yumpus), then Max is a yumpus.\n2. If Max is a tumpus, then based on Premise 2, Max is a numpus (not a yumpus).\n3. If Max is a shumpus (Premise 6 states every shumpus is a numpus), then Max is a numpus (not a yumpus).\n\nNow let's consider the second condition:\n- If Max is a lorpus (Premise 9 states Lorpuses are numpuses), then Max is a numpus (not a yumpus).\n- If Max is a jompus, then as stated earlier, Max is a yumpus.\n- If Max is a tumpus, then Max is a numpus (not a yumpus).\n\nCombining both conditions:\n- If Max is a jompus, then Max is a yumpus.\n- If Max is a tumpus or a lorpus, then Max is a numpus (not a yumpus).\n- If Max is a shumpus, then Max is a numpus (not a yumpus).\n\nThe critical point here is that if Max is a jompus, he is a yumpus. Given that Max could be a jompus, we can conclude that Max is a yumpus regardless of the other possibilities because being a jompus is sufficient to make him a yumpus.\n\nThus, we need to identify the minimal set of premises that allow us to prove Max is a yumpus. The minimal set would include:\n- Premise 4: Every jompus is a yumpus.\n- Premise 11: Max is a jompus or a tumpus or a shumpus.\n- Premise 12: Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (4),(11),(12)->(13)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is a yumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
