Since Sam is a numpus, he must also be a sterpus and a gorpus.\n   - From premise (8), we know every sterpus is a zumpus and an impus. Since Sam is a sterpus, he must also be a zumpus and an impus.\n\n2. **Link Sam to Wumpus**:\n   - From premise (4), we know lempuses are numpuses. This tells us that if something is a lempus, it is also a numpus. However, this doesn't directly help us link Sam to wumpus.\n   - From premise (3), we know gorpuses are wumpuses and shumpuses.
