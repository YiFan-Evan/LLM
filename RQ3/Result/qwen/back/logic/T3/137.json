Therefore, Max is a lorpus because he is a tumpus.\n   - Premise (2) states that everything that is luminous or wooden or a lorpus is a gorpus. Since we have established that Max is a lorpus, Max is also a gorpus.\n   - However, the goal is to prove that Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus. Since we already know Max is a lorpus, one part of the disjunction is satisfied.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the conclusion that Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus involves using premises (6) and (3).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(3)->(8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus then Taylor is a visionary.
