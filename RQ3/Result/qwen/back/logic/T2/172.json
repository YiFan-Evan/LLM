From premise (20), we know that Fae is a numpus.\n2. From premise (17), we know that numpuses are yumpuses. Therefore, Fae is a yumpus.\n3. From premise (16), we know that zumpuses are sweet. However, Fae is not directly stated to be a zumpus. We need to establish a connection between yumpuses and zumpuses.\n4. From premise (14), we know that zumpuses are tumpuses. However, this does not directly help us conclude that Fae is sweet.\n5. From premise (10), we know that yumpuses are not opaque. This does not help us conclude that Fae is sweet either.\n6. From premise (2), we know that zumpuses are lorpuses. However, this does not directly help us conclude that Fae is sweet.\n7. From premise (3), we know that lorpuses are not wooden.

From premise (5), we know that each numpus is a dumpus. Since Fae is a numpus, Fae is also a dumpus.\n10. From premise (6), we know that each dumpus is a sterpus. Since Fae is a dumpus, Fae is also a sterpus.\n11. From premise (8), we know that each sterpus is not hot. This does not help us conclude that Fae is sweet.\n12. From premise (7), we know that each dumpus is bright. This does not help us conclude that Fae is sweet.\n13. From premise (18), we know that every gorpus is a zumpus. However, this does not directly help us conclude that Fae is sweet.\n14. From premise (12), we know that every gorpus is brown. However, this does not directly help us conclude that Fae is sweet.\n15. From premise (4), we know that each gorpus is a jompus. However, this does not directly help us conclude that Fae is sweet.\n16. From premise (9), we know that jompuses are not sunny. This does not help us conclude that Fae is sweet.\n17.

From premise (14), we know that zumpuses are tumpuses. However, this does not directly help us conclude that Fae is sweet.\n21. From premise (16), we know that zumpuses are sweet. Since we established that Fae is a yumpus and yumpuses are not opaque, and since zumpuses are tumpuses and zumpuses are sweet, we need to find a direct link between yumpuses and zumpuses. However, the only direct link we have is through the premises about zumpuses being sweet and tumpuses.\n22. From premise (17), we know that numpuses are yumpuses.
