Therefore, Max is a wumpus.\n   - From premise (13), we know brimpuses are lorpuses. Therefore, Max is a lorpus.\n   - From premise (4), we know Max is a shumpus.\n   - From premise (16), we know Max is a sterpus.\n   - From premise (11), we know sterpuses are shumpuses. This is redundant but reaffirms Max is a shumpus.\n   - From premise (12), we know that everything that is a grimpus, a shumpus, and a yumpus is a numpus.

Since Max is a yumpus, he could potentially be a gorpus, but we don't have direct evidence yet.\n   - From premise (9), we know that every gorpus is a tumpus, a vumpus, and a rompus.

This is consistent with premise (10).\n   - From premise (3), we know that everything that is a shumpus, a lorpus, and a wumpus is a gorpus.
