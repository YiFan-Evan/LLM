Identify the relevant premises about Max:\n   - (23) Max is a brimpus.\n   - (24) Max is a gorpus.\n\n2. Use these premises to derive further conclusions:\n   - From (23), since Max is a brimpus, and from (6), every brimpus is a numpus, we have:\n     - (25) Max is a numpus.\n   - From (24), since Max is a gorpus, and from (5), every gorpus is a tumpus, we have:\n     - (26) Max is a tumpus.\n\n3. Use the relationship between numpuses and other entities:\n   - From (17), every numpus is a dumpus, so:\n     - (27) Max is a dumpus.\n   - From (14), every dumpus is dull, so:\n     - (28) Max is dull.\n\n4. Now, we need to show that Max is not moderate. We need to find a premise that links being dull or any other derived property to not being moderate. However, there is no direct link provided in the premises between dullness and moderation. Instead, we need to use the derived properties of other entities and see if they help us conclude Max is not moderate.\n\n5. Since we have no direct connection between dullness and moderation, let's look at the relationships involving other entities and see if we can find a connection:\n   - From (12), every numpus is a lempus, so:\n     - (29) Max is a lempus.\n   - From (19), every lempus is a zumpus, so:\n     - (30) Max is a zumpus.\n   - From (21), every zumpus is a shumpus, so:\n     - (31) Max is a shumpus.\n   - From (3), every shumpus is not sweet, so:\n     - (32) Max is not sweet.\n\n6. Still, we do not have a direct link to moderation. Let's look at the properties of wumpuses:\n   - From (13), every wumpus is a sterpus, so:\n     - (33) Every wumpus is a sterpus.\n   - From (20), every wumpus is a lorpus, so:\n     - (34) Every wumpus is a lorpus.\n   - From (16), every lorpus is not small, so:\n     - (35) Every wumpus is not small.\n   - From (22), every zumpus is a wumpus, so:\n     - (36) Max is a wumpus.\n   - From (36), since Max is a wumpus, and from (34), every wumpus is a lorpus, so:\n     - (37) Max is a lorpus.\n   - From (37), since Max is a lorpus, and from (16), every lorpus is not small, so:\n     - (38) Max is not small.\n\n7. We still need a connection to moderation. Let's consider the properties of vumpuses:\n   - From (11), every brimpus is a vumpus, so:\n     - (39) Max is a vumpus.\n   - From (9), every vumpus is temperate, so:\n     - (40) Max is temperate.\n\n8. Finally, let's connect this to the proof obligation:\n   - From (8), every wumpus is not moderate, and from (36), Max is a wumpus, so:\n     - (41) Max is not moderate.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Max is not moderate is:\n- (23), (24), (8) -> (25)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (23),(24),(8)->(25)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a gorpus.
