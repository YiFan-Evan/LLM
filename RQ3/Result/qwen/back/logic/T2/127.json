To do this, we need to check if Rex meets the conditions specified for a lorpus in premise (5):\n\n- Premise (12): Rex is luminous.\n- Premise (13): Rex is liquid.\n- Premise (10): Rex is metallic.\n- Premise (17): Rex is wooden.\n- Premise (9): Rex is a shumpus (but we need to confirm if he can be a lorpus).\n\nHowever, premise (5) does not directly apply because it defines a lorpus as something that is luminous, liquid, metallic, wooden, and a lorpus itself, but it doesn't directly state that a shumpus can be a lorpus. Instead, we need to find a way to connect Rex being a shumpus to being a lorpus.\n\nGiven that Rex is a shumpus (premise 9), we can use premise (2) which states that everything that is feisty, shy, nervous, happy, and a jompus is a shumpus. But there's no direct connection between being a shumpus and being a lorpus using the given premises. Therefore, the only way Rex could be a lorpus is if he meets all the conditions specified for a lorpus, which includes being luminous, liquid, metallic, wooden, and a lorpus.\n\nThus, we need to check if Rex meets all these conditions:\n\n- Premise (12): Rex is luminous.\n- Premise (13): Rex is liquid.\n- Premise (10): Rex is metallic.\n- Premise (17): Rex is wooden.\n- Premise (9): Rex is a shumpus.\n\nSince premise (5) specifies that a lorpus must be luminous, liquid, metallic, wooden, and a lorpus, and Rex meets these conditions, we can conclude:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (12),(13),(10),(17),(9)->(21)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is aggressive.
