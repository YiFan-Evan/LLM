Here\u2019s the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify Rex's properties**: From premises (10) and (11), we know that Rex is a jompus.\n   \n2. **Analyze the properties of jompuses**: Premise (9) states that each jompus is a vumpus, a wumpus, and a lempus.\n\n3. **Determine Rex's additional properties**:\n   - Since Rex is a jompus and each jompus is a vumpus (from premise (9)), Rex is a vumpus.\n   - Since Rex is a jompus and each jompus is a wumpus (from premise (9)), Rex is a wumpus.\n   - Since Rex is a jompus and each jompus is a lempus (from premise (9)), Rex is a lempus.\n\n4. **Combine these properties with other premises**:\n   - From premise (1), we know that lempuses are shumpuses. Therefore, Rex is a shumpus.\n   - From premise (3), we know that vumpuses are shumpuses. This confirms Rex is a shumpus again.\n   - From premise (4), we know that everything that is a brimpus, a wumpus, or an impus is a dumpus, a grimpus, and a vumpus.\n   - From premise (5), we know that everything that is a brimpus or a wumpus or an impus is a zumpus.\n\n5. **Check Rex against premise (4)**:\n   - Since Rex is a wumpus (from premise (9)), he meets the condition of being a wumpus in premise (4).\n   - Therefore, Rex must be a dumpus, a grimpus, and a vumpus according to premise (4).\n\n6. **Conclusion**: We already know from the previous steps that Rex is a vumpus (premise (9)). Hence, Rex is a grimpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Rex is a grimpus are premises (9), (4), and (11). \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (9),(4),(11)->(12)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a jompus.
