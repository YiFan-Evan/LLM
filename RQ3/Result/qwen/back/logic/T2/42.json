However, there are no premises stating that Polly is fast or slow. So, being a sterpus doesn't directly help us in this context.\n   \n2. **Rompus**: From Premise 2, everything that is sweet, spicy, and a rompus is a lempus. We already know Polly is sweet (Premise 10) and spicy (Premise 8). If we can show Polly is a rompus, then Polly would be a lempus.\n\n3. **Lempus**: From Premise 7, everything that is floral, earthy, and a lempus is a lorpus. However, there are no premises stating that Polly is floral or earthy. So, being a lempus doesn't directly help us in this context.\n\n4. **Rompus (revisited)**: From Premise 5, everything that is brown, red, and a brimpus is a rompus. But there are no premises stating that Polly is brown or red. So, being a brimpus doesn't directly help us either.\n\n5. **Lempus (final check)**: From Premise 4, everything that is dull and bright and a lempus is a zumpus. However, there are no premises stating that Polly is a zumpus. So, being a lempus doesn't directly help us here either.\n\nGiven that Polly is sweet (Premise 10), spicy (Premise 8), and a rompus (Premise 15), we can conclude that Polly is a lempus from Premise 2. \n\nNow, we need to show that Polly is dull and bright to prove that Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus.\n\nFrom Premise 13, we know Polly is dull. From Premise 11, we know Polly is bright. Therefore, Polly satisfies all conditions to be dull, bright, and a lempus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(11),(15)->(16)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is a rompus.
