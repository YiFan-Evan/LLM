We need to show that Max is blue, orange, or a lempus (premise 12).\n\n2. **Use the relevant rules**: From premise (3), we know that everything that is aggressive, angry, or a gorpus is a lempus. Since Max is a gorpus, we can deduce that Max is a lempus.\n\n3. **Derive the desired conclusion**: From premise (2), we know that everything that is blue or orange or a lempus is a tumpus. Since Max is a lempus, he must be a tumpus. However, we don't need to go further than establishing that Max is a lempus because being a lempus satisfies the condition of being blue, orange, or a lempus.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the conclusion is:\n- Premise (3): Establishes that Max is a lempus.\n- Premise (2): While not strictly necessary for the direct deduction, it helps to understand the relationship but isn't required for the minimal set.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises is just premise (3).\n\nThe final answer is: (3)->(12)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a gorpus.
