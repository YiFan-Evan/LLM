However, we know from premise 12 that Sally is not a rompus.\n\nGiven this, let's identify the minimal set of premises needed to derive the conclusion that Sally is not a wumpus:\n\n- Premise 2 tells us about the properties of rompus.\n- Premise 7 and 9 tell us about the properties of lempus.\n- Premise 12 directly states that Sally is not a rompus.\n\nNow, let's determine the logical sequence:\n\n1. Sally is a vumpus (from premises 6 and 13).\n2. Sally is an impus (from premise 14).\n3. If Sally were a wumpus, she would be a rompus (by premise 2).\n4. But Sally is not a rompus (from premise 12).\n5. Therefore, Sally cannot be a wumpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises required to prove that Sally is not a wumpus is:\n\n- Premise 2 (defines properties of rompus).\n- Premise 12 (states Sally is not a rompus).\n- Premise 6 (states Sally is a vumpus).\n- Premise 14 (states Sally is an impus).\n\nHowever, since we only need the logical sequence leading to the conclusion, the minimal set simplifies to the ones directly related to the contradiction:\n\n- Premise 12 (Sally is not a rompus).\n\nSo, the minimal set of premises that leads to the conclusion is:\n\n- Premise 12.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(12)->(15)**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sally is an impus.

From Premise 12, Sally is a dumpus.\n2. Since every dumpus is a rompus (Premise 7), Sally is a rompus.\n3. However, Premise 3 explicitly states that Sally is not a rompus.\n4. This creates a contradiction unless Sally cannot satisfy the conditions that make her a rompus.\n\n### Conditions for Being a Rompus\n\nThe key condition for being a rompus is:\n- Everything that is a vumpus, a wumpus, and an impus is a rompus (Premise 13).\n\nSince Sally is a vumpus (Premise 2) and an impus (Premise 1), for Sally to be a rompus, she must also be a wumpus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nTo avoid the contradiction, Sally cannot be a wumpus because if she were, she would be a rompus, which contradicts Premise 3.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises that lead to the conclusion that Sally is not a wumpus is:\n\n- Premise 3 (Sally is not a rompus).\n- Premise 12 (Sally is a dumpus).\n\nThese premises together show that if Sally were a wumpus, she would be a rompus, contradicting Premise 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(3),(12)->(15)**."}]
