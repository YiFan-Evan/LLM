Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**: We need to focus on the premises that directly relate to Polly and the properties of tumpuses.\n\n2. **Determine Intermediate Steps**:\n    - First, we need to establish that Polly has some properties that help us connect her to the definition of a tumpus.\n    - We know Polly is a dumpus (Premise 10) and a yumpus (Premise 9).\n\n3. **Connect Polly to the Definition of Tumpus**:\n    - From Premise 4, we know that everything that is an impus or a dumpus or a yumpus is a numpus. Since Polly is a dumpus and a yumpus, she is also a numpus.\n    - From Premise 5, we know that everything that is a lempus, a grimpus, or a numpus is a shumpus. Since Polly is a numpus, she is also a shumpus.\n    - From Premise 6, we know that everything that is a rompus, a dumpus, or a lorpus is a lempus. Since Polly is a dumpus, she is also a lempus.\n    - Now, since Polly is a lempus, a grimpus (from Premise 7 because all zumpuses are grimpuses, and from Premise 1 we know zumpuses exist if something is a brimpus, lempus, or rompus, and from Premise 6 we know she is a lempus), and a numpus (as established earlier), she is a shumpus (from Premise 5).\n    - From Premise 2, we know that everything that is a rompus, a dumpus, or a lorpus is a jompus. Since Polly is a dumpus, she is also a jompus.\n    - From Premise 1, we know that everything that is a brimpus, a lempus, or a rompus is a zumpus and a tumpus and a vumpus. Since Polly is a lempus (from Premise 6), she is a zumpus and a tumpus and a vumpus.\n    - From Premise 8, we know that every vumpus is a yumpus. Since Polly is a vumpus (from Premise 1), she is indeed a yumpus, which we already knew.\n    - Finally, since Polly is a zumpus (from Premise 1), and zumpuses are tumpuses (from Premise 1), Polly is a tumpus.\n\n4. **Formulate the Final Answer**:\n    - The premises needed to prove Polly is a tumpus are (1), (6), (7), and (10).
