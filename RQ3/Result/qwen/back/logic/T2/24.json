Since every yumpus is a tumpus (from premise (2)), Max is a tumpus and thus a dumpus.\n   - From premise (8), every tumpus is a numpus, so Max is a numpus.\n   - From premise (9), every rompus is a sterpus. From premise (20), every rompus is a zumpus, so every zumpus is a sterpus.\n   - From premise (18), every sterpus is a brimpus, so every zumpus is a brimpus. Since every rompus is a zumpus, every rompus is a brimpus.\n   - From premise (4), every sterpus is an impus, so every rompus is an impus.\n   - From premise (1), each yumpus is nervous, so Max is nervous.\n   - From premise (2), every yumpus is a tumpus, so Max is a tumpus.\n   - From premise (3), numpuses are rompuses, so Max is a rompus.\n   - From premise (5), each rompus is not fast, so Max is not fast.\n   - From premise (6), each numpus is angry, so Max is angry.\n   - From premise (7), jompuses are hot, so Max is hot.\n   - From premise (8), every tumpus is a numpus, so Max is a numpus.\n   - From premise (11), every numpus is a grimpus, so Max is a grimpus.\n   - From premise (12), every brimpus is sweet, so Max is sweet.\n   - From premise (13), every grimpus is not dull, so Max is not dull.\n   - From premise (14), every vumpus is a gorpus, so Max is a gorpus.\n   - From premise (15), every tumpus is muffled, so Max is muffled.\n   - From premise (16), every zumpus is overcast, so Max is overcast.\n   - From premise (17), every vumpus is brown, so Max is brown.\n   - From premise (18), every sterpus is a brimpus, so Max is a brimpus.\n   - From premise (19), every sterpus is not large, so Max is not large.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we see that the premises (23) and (19) directly lead to the conclusion that Max is not large.

Hence, Max is a tumpus.\n   \n3. **Relate tumpuses to other categories**:\n   - From premise (3), every tumpus is a dumpus. Therefore, Max is a dumpus.\n   - From premise (17), every tumpus is a numpus. Therefore, Max is a numpus.\n   - From premise (10), every tumpus is muffled. Therefore, Max is muffled.\n   - From premise (15), dumpuses are not transparent. Therefore, Max is not transparent.\n   \n4. **Relate numpuses to other categories**:\n   - From premise (22), every numpus is a rompus. Therefore, Max is a rompus.\n   - From premise (24), each yumpus is nervous. Therefore, Max is nervous.\n   - From premise (19), each numpus is angry. Therefore, Max is angry.\n   - From premise (14), numpuses are grimpuses. Therefore, Max is a grimpus.\n   - From premise (12), every grimpus is not dull. Therefore, Max is not dull.\n   \n5. **Relate rompuses to other categories**:\n   - From premise (22), every numpus is a rompus. Therefore, Max is a rompus.\n   - From premise (20), each rompus is not fast. Therefore, Max is not fast.\n   \n6. **Relate brimpuses and sterpuses to other categories**:\n   - From premise (7), sterpuses are brimpuses. Therefore, every sterpus is a brimpus.\n   - From premise (16), every rompus is a sterpus. Therefore, every rompus is a brimpus.\n   - From premise (6), every sterpus is not large. Therefore, every rompus is not large. Hence, Max is not large.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe premises (2), (23), and (6) are sufficient to derive that Max is not large. Specifically, premise (2) establishes that Max is a yumpus, premise (23) establishes that every yumpus is a tumpus, and premise (6) establishes that every sterpus (and hence every rompus, and thus Max) is not large.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(23),(6)->(25)."}]
