Let's see what happens if we assume Sam is a tumpus:\n  \n  - If Sam is a tumpus, then according to Premise 7, since Sam is also a yumpus and a rompus, Sam must be a wumpus. This is consistent with Premise 14.\n  \n  - According to Premise 6, since Sam is a tumpus, yumpus, and rompus, Sam must be a shumpus. But this contradicts Premise 4, which states that Sam is not a shumpus.\n  \nThus, the only way to avoid the contradiction is if Sam is not a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(8)->(15)."}]
