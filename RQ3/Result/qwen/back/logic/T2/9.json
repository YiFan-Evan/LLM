Let's break down the problem step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the key relationships involving Fae**: We know from premises (19) and (20) that Fae is both an impus and a numpus.\n2. **Examine the implications of being an impus**: Premises (1), (9), and (18) establish that being an impus implies being a gorpus, an impus, and a brimpus respectively. However, none of these directly relate to happiness.\n3. **Examine the implications of being a numpus**: Premises (6) and (15) state that numpuses are not large and every numpus is a rompus. But again, there's no direct link to happiness.\n4. **Look for indirect links to happiness**: The only premises that mention happiness are (10) and (17). Premise (10) states that every shumpus is happy, but we don't have any information linking Fae directly to being a shumpus.\n5. **Check if Fae can be a shumpus indirectly**: Premises (5) and (16) link shumpuses to jompuses and brimpuses. Specifically, (16) states that each brimpus is a shumpus. From (18), we know Fae is a brimpus (since Fae is an impus and all impuses are brimpuses). Therefore, Fae is a shumpus.\n6. **Conclude based on the above steps**: Since Fae is a shumpus (from steps 5) and every shumpus is happy (from premise (10)), we can conclude that Fae is happy.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to derive that Fae is happy are:\n- (18): Each impus is a brimpus.\n- (16): Each brimpus is a shumpus.\n- (10): Each shumpus is happy.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises leading to the proof obligation is (18), (16), (10).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (18),(16),(10)->(21)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is a numpus.
