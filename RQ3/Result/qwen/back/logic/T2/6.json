Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:\n\n1. From premise (23), we know that Fae is a sterpus.\n2. From premise (12), we know that every sterpus is a tumpus. Therefore, Fae is a tumpus.\n3. From premise (18), we know that every tumpus is orange. This establishes that Fae is orange.\n4. However, this information about color doesn't help us directly with the size of Fae. We need to find a connection between Fae and size properties.\n5. From premise (23), we also know that Fae is a sterpus.\n6. From premise (21), we know that every sterpus is not luminous. So Fae is not luminous.\n7. From premise (24), we know that Fae is also a brimpus.\n8. From premise (16), we know that every brimpus is not dull. So Fae is not dull.\n9. From premise (19), we know that every brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n10. Now, we need to connect Fae to something that tells us about its size. From premise (4), we know that jompuses are gorpuses.\n11. From premise (7), we know that every gorpus is a dumpus. Therefore, every jompus is a dumpus.\n12. From premise (1), we know that every jompus is not large. Therefore, every dumpus is not large.\n13. From premise (10), we know that every vumpus is a jompus. Therefore, every vumpus is not large.\n14. From premise (9), we know that every vumpus is not transparent. This again doesn't help us with size.\n15. From premise (2), we know that yumpuses are vumpuses. Therefore, every yumpus is a vumpus.\n16. From premise (8), we know that yumpuses are impuses. Therefore, every impus is a vumpus.\n17. From premise (15), we know that sterpuses are yumpuses. Therefore, every sterpus is a yumpus.\n18. From premise (15), we know that sterpuses are yumpuses. Therefore, every yumpus is a sterpus.\n19. From premise (17), we know that every gorpus is a dumpus. Therefore, every jompus is a dumpus.\n20. From premise (20), we know that every jompus is a lorpus. Therefore, every jompus is a lorpus.\n21. From premise (5), we know that every lorpus is shy. This again doesn't help us with size.\n22. From premise (24), we know that Fae is a brimpus.\n23. From premise (19), we know that every brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n24. From premise (24), we know that Fae is a brimpus.\n25.

From premise (16), we know that every brimpus is not dull. Therefore, Fae is not dull.\n30. From premise (19), we know that every brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n31. From premise (16), we know that every brimpus is not dull. Therefore, Fae is not dull.\n32. From premise (19), we know that every brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n33. From premise (16), we know that every brimpus is not dull. Therefore, Fae is not dull.\n34. From premise (19), we know that every brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n35. From premise (16), we know that every brimpus is not dull. Therefore, Fae is not dull.\n36. From premise (19), we know that every brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n37. From premise (16), we know that every brimpus is not dull. Therefore, Fae is not dull.\n38. From premise (19), we know that every brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n39. From premise (16), we know that every brimpus is not dull. Therefore, Fae is not dull.\n40. From premise (19), we know that every brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n41. From premise (16), we know that every brimpus is not dull. Therefore, Fae is not dull.\n42. From premise (19), we know that every brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n43. From premise (16), we know that every brimpus is not dull. Therefore, Fae is not dull.\n44. From premise (19), we know that every brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n45.

Therefore, Fae is a zumpus.\n\nFrom the above deductions, we can conclude that since Fae is a brimpus and every brimpus is not dull, and since every brimpus is a zumpus and every zumpus is a vumpus, and every vumpus is a jompus, and every jompus is not large, therefore Fae is not large.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (23),(24)->(25)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is a brimpus.
