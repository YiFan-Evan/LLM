However, Premise 12 includes numpuses as one of the possibilities, and Premise 5 says all yumpuses are grimpuses. Since yumpuses are included in both lists, and yumpuses are definitely grimpuses, we can infer that numpuses are also likely to be grimpuses through some implicit logical connection.\n\n- If Stella is a yumpus (Premise 11 and Premise 12), then by Premise 5, yumpuses are grimpuses. Therefore, Stella would be a grimpus.\n\n- If Stella is a rompus (Premise 11 and Premise 12), then by Premise 9, rompuses are grimpuses. Therefore, Stella would be a grimpus.\n\n- If Stella is a sterpus (Premise 12), then by Premise 1, sterpuses are grimpuses. Therefore, Stella would be a grimpus.\n\nSince Stella must be one of these possibilities and each possibility leads to her being a grimpus, we conclude that Stella is a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Stella is a grimpus is:\n\nPremises (5), (8), (9), and (11) are sufficient to cover all possibilities for Stella.
