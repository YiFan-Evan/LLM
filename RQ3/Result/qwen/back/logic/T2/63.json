Let's break it down:\n\n1. From Premise (12), we know Polly is fast.\n2. From Premise (14), we know Polly is moderate.\n3. From Premise (10), we know Polly is a tumpus. We need to find out if a tumpus can be a wumpus under any condition. However, there is no direct premise linking tumpus directly to wumpus. Instead, we need to check other conditions.\n\nFrom Premise (5):\n- Everything that is muffled, melodic, and a tumpus is a wumpus.\n  - Since Polly is muffled (Premise 11) and melodic (Premise 13) and a tumpus (Premise 10), Polly is a wumpus.\n\nThus, Polly is moderate, fast, and a wumpus. Therefore, we can conclude:\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove Polly is moderate, fast, and a wumpus is Premises (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), and (5).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(11),(12),(13),(14),(5)->(18)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is a sterpus.
