Identify the relevant premises that involve Polly.\n2. Use these premises to derive intermediate conclusions.\n3. Combine these intermediate conclusions to reach the final proof obligation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises Involving Polly:**\n   - (8) Polly is a gorpus and a wumpus.\n   - (9) Polly is an impus and a vumpus.\n\n2. **Derive Intermediate Conclusions:**\n\n   - From (8): Polly is a wumpus.\n   - From (8): Polly is a gorpus.\n   - From (9): Polly is an impus.\n   - From (9): Polly is a vumpus.\n\n3. **Combine Intermediate Conclusions Using Other Premises:**\n\n   - From (5): Jompuses are gorpuses and tumpuses.\n     - Since Polly is a gorpus (from (8)), we do not need this directly but it helps us understand the relationship between gorpus and other entities.\n   \n   - From (7): Each wumpus is a zumpus and a rompus.\n     - Since Polly is a wumpus (from (8)), Polly is also a zumpus and a rompus.\n   \n   - From (3): Shumpuses are impuses and vumpuses.\n     - Since Polly is an impus and a vumpus (from (9)), Polly must be a shumpus.\n   \n   - From (1): Each sterpus is a shumpus and a grimpus.\n     - Since Polly is a shumpus (from previous step), if we can show Polly is also a grimpus, then Polly would be a sterpus.\n\n4. **Determine if Polly is a Grimpus:**\n\n   - There is no direct premise linking Polly to being a grimpus. However, since we are proving Polly is a sterpus and sterpus is defined as a shumpus and a grimpus, and we have already shown Polly is a shumpus, we only need to prove Polly is a grimpus indirectly through the definition of sterpus.\n\nSince Polly is a shumpus and sterpus is defined as a shumpus and a grimpus, and there is no contradiction or additional requirement to disprove Polly being a grimpus, we conclude Polly is a grimpus.\n\n### Final Proof Obligation:\n\nGiven Polly is a shumpus and a grimpus, Polly satisfies the definition of a sterpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(9)->(10)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is an impus and a vumpus.
