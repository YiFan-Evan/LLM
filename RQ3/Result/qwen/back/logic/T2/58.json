We don't have any information about Fae being fast, moderate, a lorpus, or a gorpus directly.\n   - However, sterpus is defined in terms of impus (premise (2)), so we need to verify if Fae is an impus.\n   - From premise (10): Fae is an impus. This means Fae satisfies one condition for being a sterpus.\n   - From premise (8): Every sterpus is a lorpus and a gorpus. But we don't have direct information that Fae is a lorpus or a gorpus.\n   - Since we do not have sufficient information to conclude that Fae is a sterpus based on the given premises, we cannot derive that Fae is a sterpus from the given premises alone.\n\nGiven the above analysis, we see that there isn't enough information provided to prove that Fae is a sterpus.
