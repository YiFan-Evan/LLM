Each tumpus is a sterpus.\n2. Rompuses are shumpuses.\n3. Every lempus is a dumpus.\n4. Tumpuses are rompuses.\n5. Wumpuses are sterpuses.\n6. Everything that is an impus, a dumpus, or a numpus is a sterpus.\n7. Tumpuses are numpuses.\n8. Each rompus is a lempus and an impus and a tumpus.\n9. Yumpuses are numpuses.\n10. Stella is a sterpus, a vumpus, and a gorpus.\n11. Stella is a tumpus and a yumpus and a wumpus.\n\nWe need to prove that Stella is a rompus, an impus, or a grimpus. Let's break down the relevant premises:\n\n- From premise 11, we know that Stella is a tumpus, a yumpus, and a wumpus.\n- From premise 4, since Stella is a tumpus, she is also a rompus.\n- From premise 9, since Stella is a yumpus and yumpuses are numpuses, Stella is a numpus.\n- From premise 7, since Stella is a tumpus, she is also a numpus.\n- From premise 6, since Stella is a numpus, she is also a sterpus (which we already knew from other premises).\n\nNow, let's focus on the specific claims about impus and grimpus:\n- From premise 8, every rompus is an impus. Since Stella is a rompus (from premise 4), she is also an impus.\n- There is no information provided about grimpus directly, so we cannot infer anything about Stella being a grimpus based on the given premises.\n\nGiven the above analysis, we can conclude that Stella is either a rompus or an impus. Therefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Stella is a rompus, an impus, or a grimpus would be premises 4, 8, and the fact that Stella is a tumpus (premise 11).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed is premise 4 (Stella is a rompus because she is a tumpus) and premise 8 (every rompus is an impus).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (4),(8)->(12)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Stella is a tumpus and a yumpus and a wumpus.
