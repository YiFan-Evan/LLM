However, neither of these directly helps us prove the final statement. Instead, we need to look at other premises involving grimpus or discordant properties.\n   - Premise (5): Everything that is discordant or a grimpus is a gorpus. This does not directly help either, but it shows a relationship between discordant and grimpus.\n   - Premise (3): Everything that is happy or a grimpus is a brimpus. This also does not directly help, but it confirms that being a grimpus can lead to being a brimpus.\n   - Premise (5) is critical here: If Alex is discordant or a grimpus, then Alex is a gorpus. But we need to prove Alex is discordant or a grimpus.\n\n4. **Final Derivation**:\n   - Since we know Alex is a jompus (from Premise 6), and Premise 1 states that everything that is a jompus is a grimpus, we can conclude that Alex is a grimpus.\n   - Therefore, if Alex is a grimpus, then according to Premise (5), Alex is either discordant or a grimpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation is Premises (1), (6), and (7).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(6),(7)->(8)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is a vumpus.
