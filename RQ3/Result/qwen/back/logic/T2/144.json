We know from premise (19) that Rex is both an impus and a jompus. Our goal is to prove that Rex is not large, so we need to find a way to connect Rex's status as an impus or jompus to the property of being large.\n\nLet's break down the relevant premises:\n\n- Premise (6): Each gorpus is not large.\n- Premise (18): Every tumpus is a gorpus.\n- Premise (10): Every tumpus is a numpus.\n- Premise (17): Each numpus is windy.\n- Premise (4): Impuses are tumpuses.\n- Premise (11): Impuses are lempuses.\n- Premise (5): Each lempus is sweet.\n- Premise (9): Every jompus is a vumpus.\n- Premise (20): Rex is a jompus.\n- Premise (21): Rex is an impus.\n\nFrom premise (18), we know that every tumpus is a gorpus. From premise (10), every tumpus is also a numpus. From premise (17), each numpus is windy. However, these properties don't directly help us with the property of being large.\n\nThe key premises are:\n- Premise (4): Impuses are tumpuses.\n- Premise (18): Every tumpus is a gorpus.\n- Premise (6): Each gorpus is not large.\n\nSince Rex is an impus (premise 19), we can use premise (4) to say that Rex is a tumpus. Then, using premise (18), we can say that Rex is a gorpus. Finally, using premise (6), we conclude that Rex is not large.\n\n### Answer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (19),(4),(18),(6)->(21)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a jompus.
