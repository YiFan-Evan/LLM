Since Premise (7) states that every entity that is a dumpus, lorpus, and jompus is a shumpus, we know Alex is a shumpus.\n\n2. **Alex is a zumpus:** From Premise (11), Alex is a zumpus.\n\n3. **Zumpus is a lorpus:** From Premise (3), each zumpus is a lorpus. Therefore, since Alex is a zumpus, Alex is also a lorpus.\n\n4. **Alex is a sterpus:** From Premise (11), Alex is a sterpus.\n\n5. **Sterpus is a wumpus:** From Premise (4), every sterpus is a wumpus. Therefore, Alex is a wumpus.\n\n6. **Alex is a shumpus:** From Premise (7), Alex is a shumpus because Alex is a dumpus, lorpus, and jompus.\n\n7. **Alex is a sterpus, gorpus, or rompus:** From Premise (11), Alex is a sterpus. Therefore, from Premise (6), Alex is a tumpus.\n\n8. **Alex is not a gorpus:** From Premise (14), Alex is not a brimpus, but Alex is a zumpus. From Premise (10), every gorpus is a brimpus. Therefore, since Alex is not a brimpus, Alex cannot be a gorpus.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we see that the premises needed to prove Alex is a lorpus, a tumpus, and not a gorpus are:\n\n- Premise (8): Alex is a dumpus.\n- Premise (9): Alex is a jompus.\n- Premise (3): Each zumpus is a lorpus.\n- Premise (11): Alex is a brimpus, zumpus, and sterpus.\n- Premise (6): Everything that is a sterpus, gorpus, or rompus is a tumpus.\n- Premise (14): Alex is an impus and Alex is not a brimpus and Alex is a zumpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises required is (8), (9), (3), (11), (6), and (14).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(8),(9),(3),(11),(6),(14)->(15)**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is an impus and Alex is not a brimpus and Alex is a zumpus.
