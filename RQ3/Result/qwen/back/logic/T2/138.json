Since Sam is a lempus, Sam must be a brimpus.\n3. **Use the definition of brimpus**: Premise (3) states that everything that is moderate or a brimpus is a gorpus. However, this doesn't directly help us with the snowy condition.\n4. **Use the definition of lorpus**: Premise (2) tells us that everything that is spicy or a lorpus is a dumpus. Since Sam is a lorpus, Sam must be a dumpus.\n5. **Derive the snowy condition**: Premise (4) states that everything that is snowy or a brimpus is a numpus.
