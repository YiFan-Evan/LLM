Here's the step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the relevant premises:** We know Sally is a brimpus (Premise 10) and a wumpus (Premise 11).\n2. **Use Premise 2 to establish a connection between wumpus and dumpus:** Since Sally is a wumpus, by Premise 2, Sally is also a dumpus.\n3. **Use Premise 11 to find a relationship involving brimpus:** From Premise 10, we already have Sally as a brimpus.\n4. **Use Premise 3 to find a relationship involving brimpus:** Since Sally is a brimpus, and Premise 3 states that everything that is dull or a lorpus is a brimpus, we need to see if we can deduce something about Sally being dull or a lorpus.\n5. **Use Premise 7 to relate lorpus to gorpus:** Premise 7 states that everything that is slow or a gorpus is a lorpus. However, there is no direct information about Sally being slow or a gorpus, so this doesn't directly help us yet.\n6. **Use Premise 5 to find a relationship involving brimpus:** Premise 5 states that everything that is rainy or a brimpus is a vumpus. Since Sally is a brimpus, we need to see if we can deduce that Sally is rainy or directly conclude that Sally is a vumpus.\n7. **Directly conclude that Sally is a vumpus:** From Premise 5 and the fact that Sally is a brimpus, we can infer that Sally is either rainy or a vumpus. But since we need to prove Sally is brown or a vumpus, we need to check if we can use Premise 6.\n8. **Use Premise 6 to find a relationship involving vumpus:** Premise 6 states that everything that is brown or a vumpus is a shumpus. Since we want to prove Sally is brown or a vumpus, and we already have Sally as a vumpus from Premise 5, we can conclude that Sally is brown or a vumpus.\n\nBy combining these deductions, we can conclude that Sally is brown or a vumpus.\n\n**Final Answer:** Therefore, the final answer is: (10),(11)->(12)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sally is a wumpus.
