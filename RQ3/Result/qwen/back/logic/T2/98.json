We need to check if Sam meets all the necessary criteria to be classified as a jompus.\n\nAccording to the premises:\n- A jompus must be transparent and opaque and also slow, fast, and moderate.\n- Sam must be slow, fast, and moderate to be a jompus. \n\nFrom the premises, we know:\n- Sam is slow (Premise 8).\n- Sam is fast (Premise 14).\n- Sam is moderate (Premise 15).\n\nHowever, there is no information provided about Sam being transparent and opaque, which are required conditions for being a jompus. Therefore, we cannot definitively conclude that Sam is a jompus based on the given information.\n\nNonetheless, we need to determine if Sam is slow, fast, moderate, and a jompus. Since the transparency and opacity condition is not met, we cannot classify Sam as a jompus. However, we can still verify if Sam is slow, fast, and moderate.\n\nGiven the premises, we can derive the following:\n- From Premise 8, we know Sam is slow.\n- From Premise 14, we know Sam is fast.\n- From Premise 15, we know Sam is moderate.\n\nThus, Sam is slow, fast, and moderate. However, since there is no information about Sam being transparent and opaque, we cannot conclude that Sam is a jompus. Therefore, we do not have enough information to prove that Sam is slow, fast, moderate, and a jompus.\n\n### Answer\nSince we cannot establish that Sam is a jompus due to the lack of information regarding transparency and opacity, we cannot prove that Sam is slow, fast, moderate, and a jompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: None of the premises lead to proving (17).
