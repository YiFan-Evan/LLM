Everything that is discordant, muffled, melodic, loud, and a jompus is a numpus.\n2. Everything that is happy, nervous, shy, feisty, and a gorpus is a brimpus.\n3. Everything that is transparent, opaque, and a rompus is a vumpus.\n4. Everything that is wooden, metallic, liquid, luminous, and a gorpus is a shumpus.\n5. Everything that is spicy, sour, bitter, sweet, and a rompus is a gorpus.\n\nWe need to find out which definition Wren matches. Let's check each one:\n\n- Numpus: Wren does not have the properties \"discordant\", \"muffled\", \"melodic\", or \"loud\".\n- Vumpus: Wren does not have the property \"rompus\" but instead has the property \"jompus\".\n- Shumpus: Wren does not have the properties \"wooden\", \"metallic\", \"liquid\", or \"luminous\".\n- Gorpus: Wren has the properties \"spicy\", \"sour\", \"bitter\", \"sweet\", and \"rompus\". Therefore, Wren is a gorpus.\n\nSince Wren is a gorpus, we can now use Premise 2 to check if Wren also fits the definition of a brimpus:\n- Brimpus: Wren has the properties \"happy\", \"nervous\", \"shy\", \"feisty\", and \"gorpus\".\n\nThus, Wren satisfies all the conditions to be a brimpus. Therefore, the proof obligation (18) Wren is happy and nervous and shy and feisty and a gorpus is true.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(8),(10),(12),(14),(15),(16),(17)->(18). \n\nHowever, upon re-evaluation, we realize that (16) and (15) are not needed because they do not contribute to proving the brimpus condition.

Wren does not meet these criteria (17).\n   - **Vumpus**: Requires transparent, opaque, and rompus. Wren meets these criteria (15), but this doesn't help us directly since we need to prove Wren is a gorpus.\n   - **Shumpus**: Requires wooden, metallic, liquid, luminous, and gorpus. Wren does not meet these criteria (14).\n   - **Gorpus**: Requires spicy, sour, bitter, sweet, and rompus. Wren meets these criteria (13).\n   - **Brimpus**: Requires happy, nervous, shy, feisty, and gorpus. We need to prove this (16).\n\n3. **Determine if Wren is a Gorpus**:\n   - From (13): \"Everything that is spicy and sour and bitter and sweet and a rompus is a gorpus.\"\n   - Wren is spicy (7), sour (1), bitter (5), sweet (9), and a rompus (11).\n   - Therefore, Wren is a gorpus.\n\n4. **Determine if Wren is a Brimpus**:\n   - From (16): \"Everything that is happy and nervous and shy and feisty and a gorpus is a brimpus.\"\n   - Wren is happy (6), nervous (12), shy (4), feisty (10), and a gorpus (as proven above).\n   - Therefore, Wren is a brimpus.\n\n### Conclusion\nWren satisfies all the conditions to be a brimpus. Thus, the proof obligation (18) Wren is happy and nervous and shy and feisty and a gorpus is true.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(12),(4),(10),(11)->(18)."}]
