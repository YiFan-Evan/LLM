To do so, we need to check if Sam satisfies the conditions for being a gorpus (i.e., being large, a dumpus, and a sterpus).\n\nFrom the premises:\n- Sam is a wumpus and a yumpus.\n- From premise (4): Wumpuses are shy and gorpuses and yumpuses.\n- Therefore, since Sam is a wumpus, Sam is a gorpus (from the fact that wumpuses are gorpuses).\n- Also, from premise (5): Yumpuses are dull and zumpuses and brimpuses.\n- Since Sam is a yumpus, Sam is dull and a zumpus and a brimpus.\n- Additionally, from premise (9): Sam is sour, a jompus, and a tumpus.\n- And from premise (7): Each dumpus is sour, a tumpus, and a jompus.\n- Therefore, Sam is a dumpus.\n- Now, we need to check if Sam is large and a sterpus.\n- Since Sam is a gorpus and gorpuses are large and dumpuses, and since Sam is already established as a dumpus, Sam is large.\n- However, there is no direct premise stating that Sam is a sterpus. There is no information linking Sam to sterpus directly or indirectly through other properties.\n\nSince we cannot definitively conclude that Sam is a sterpus based on the given premises, we cannot classify Sam as a gorpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: None of the premises directly or indirectly establish that Sam is a sterpus.
