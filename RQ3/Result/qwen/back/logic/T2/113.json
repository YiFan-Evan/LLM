Since every jompus is a rompus (from (1)), Max is a rompus.\n- From (12), Max is an impus. Since every impus is a shumpus (from (4)), Max is a shumpus.\n- From (11), Max is a yumpus and a lempus and a shumpus.\n- From (10), since every tumpus is a rompus (from (10)), and from (12) and (9), Max is a dumpus (which is a rompus).\n- From (7), each tumpus is a numpus, sterpus, and wumpus. Therefore, if Max were a tumpus, Max would have to be a numpus, sterpus, and wumpus.\n- However, from (2), dumpuses are not numpuses. Since Max is a dumpus (from (12)), Max cannot be a numpus.\n- From (7), tumpuses are numpuses.
