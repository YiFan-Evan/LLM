(This tells us what lorpuses are, but does not directly help us with yumpuses.)\n- (2) Numpuses are kind and yumpuses and zumpuses. (This tells us that numpuses are yumpuses and zumpuses, so if Stella is a numpus, she could also be a yumpus.)\n- (3) Dumpuses are sunny and numpuses. (This tells us that numpuses are dumpuses, but again does not directly help with yumpuses.)\n- (4) Each wumpus is bright and a brimpus and a vumpus. (This tells us about wumpuses, but they are not directly related to yumpuses.)\n- (5) Yumpuses are shy, wumpuses, and tumpuses. (This tells us what yumpuses are, but does not directly help us conclude that Stella is one unless we have additional information.)\n- (6) Shumpuses are opaque, transparent, and impuses. (This tells us about shumpuses, but they are not directly related to yumpuses.)\n- (7) Each tumpus is metallic and a rompus and a lorpus.
