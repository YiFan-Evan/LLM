Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. Identify the relevant premises about Stella.\n   - Premise (24): Stella is a brimpus.\n   \n2. Use the premises about brimpuses to find more information about Stella.\n   - Premise (2): Every brimpus is a vumpus.\n   - Premise (3): Every brimpus is snowy.\n   - Premise (19): Vumpuses are tumpuses.\n   - Premise (1): Each tumpus is not spicy.\n   - Premise (14): Every vumpus is wooden.\n   - Premise (7): Each brimpus is a numpus.\n   - Premise (12): Each numpus is cold.\n   - Premise (21): Vumpuses are grimpuses.\n   - Premise (13): Each grimpus is not blue.\n   - Premise (18): Grimpuses are impuses.\n   - Premise (8): Impuses are not muffled.\n   \n3.

Therefore, Stella is a vumpus.\n- From Premise (19): Vumpuses are tumpuses. Therefore, Stella is a tumpus.\n- From Premise (1): Each tumpus is not spicy. This does not help us directly.\n- From Premise (14): Every vumpus is wooden. Therefore, Stella is wooden.\n- From Premise (7): Each brimpus is a numpus. Therefore, Stella is a numpus.\n- From Premise (12): Each numpus is cold. This does not help us directly.\n- From Premise (21): Vumpuses are grimpuses. Therefore, Stella is a grimpus.\n- From Premise (13): Each grimpus is not blue. This does not help us directly.\n- From Premise (18): Grimpuses are impuses.

Therefore, Stella is a grimpus.\n- From Premise (18): Grimpuses are impuses. Therefore, Stella is an impus.\n- From Premise (20): Every dumpus is a rompus.\n- From Premise (15): Every rompus is a dumpus.\n- From Premise (23): Stella is a jompus. This does not help us directly.\n\nSince there is no direct link between Stella being a brimpus and being a rompus, we need to look at other possibilities. However, if we consider the possibility that there is a missing link or a different path, we can see that the only way to prove transparency is through being a rompus, and the only way to get to rompus is through being a dumpus, but there is no direct evidence that Stella is a dumpus.\n\nGiven the current premises, the most logical conclusion is that there is insufficient information to prove Stella is transparent. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: None of the premises directly lead to proving that Stella is transparent.
