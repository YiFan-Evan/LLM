Identify that Wren is a wumpus and a shumpus.\n2. Use the information about shumpuses to connect them to other puses.\n3. Derive the property of being small using the given premises.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Wren is a wumpus**: From Premise (19), Wren is a wumpus.\n2. **Wren is a shumpus**: From Premise (19), Wren is also a shumpus.\n3. **Shumpuses are grimpuses**: From Premise (4), every shumpus is a grimpus. Therefore, Wren is a grimpus.\n4. **Grimpuses are vumpuses**: From Premise (5), every grimpus is a vumpus. Therefore, Wren is a vumpus.\n5. **Vumpuses are jompuses**: From Premise (11), each vumpus is a jompus. Therefore, Wren is a jompus.\n6. **Jompuses are impuses**: From Premise (1), each jompus is an impus. Therefore, Wren is an impus.\n7. **Jompuses are dumpuses**: From Premise (12), each jompus is a dumpus. Therefore, Wren is a dumpus.\n8. **Dumpuses are bright**: From Premise (8), every dumpus is bright. However, this is not needed for our final conclusion.\n9. **Grimpuses are yumpuses**: From Premise (6), grimpuses are yumpuses. Therefore, Wren is a yumpus.\n10. **Yumpuses are not red**: From Premise (14), each yumpus is not red. However, this is not needed for our final conclusion.\n11. **Vumpuses are floral**: From Premise (10), each vumpus is floral. However, this is not needed for our final conclusion.\n12. **Vumpuses are rompuses**: From Premise (15), each vumpus is a rompus. However, this is not needed for our final conclusion.\n13. **Jompuses are small**: From Premise (3), jompuses are small. Therefore, since Wren is a jompus, Wren is small.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe minimal set of premises required to prove that Wren is small is:\n\n(19),(19),(4),(5),(11),(12)->(21)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (19),(19),(4),(5),(11),(12)->(21)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Wren is a shumpus.

So, Wren is a tumpus.\n4. **Tumpuses are loud**: From Premise (5). However, this is not directly relevant to proving Wren is small.\n\nNext, consider Wren as a wumpus:\n\n5. **Every wumpus is a sterpus**: From Premise (4). So, Wren is a sterpus.\n6. **Each wumpus is nervous**: From Premise (12). So, Wren is nervous.\n\nNow, consider Wren as a shumpus:\n\n7. **Every shumpus is a grimpus**: From Premise (17). So, Wren is a grimpus.\n8. **Each grimpus is a vumpus**: From Premise (16). So, Wren is a vumpus.\n9. **Each vumpus is floral**: From Premise (11).

So, Wren is small.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have established that Wren is a jompus and that each jompus is small.
