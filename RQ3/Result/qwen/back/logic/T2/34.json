If an entity belongs to a category that is a subset of wumpuses, then it is a wumpus.\n2. We need to check the categories Sam belongs to and see if any of them imply that Sam is a wumpus.\n\nLet's break down the premises and see how they relate to Sam:\n\n- From premise (1), we know Sterpuses are wumpuses, but this does not help us with Sam.\n- Premise (2) tells us that every lorpus is a wumpus.\n- Premise (3) tells us that Lempuses are wumpuses, but this does not help us with Sam.\n- Premise (4) tells us that Lorpuses are vumpuses, but again, this does not help us with Sam directly.\n- Premise (5) tells us that every jompus is a vumpus, but this does not help us with Sam directly.\n- Premise (6) tells us that Impuses are vumpuses, but this does not help us with Sam directly.\n- Premise (7) tells us that Impuses are wumpuses.\n- Premise (8) tells us that Tumpuses are vumpuses, but this does not help us with Sam directly.\n- Premise (9) tells us that each tumpus is a wumpus.\n- Premise (10) tells us that each yumpus is a wumpus, but this does not help us with Sam.\n- Premise (11) states that Sam is a jompus or a tumpus or an impus.\n- Premise (12) states that Sam is a tumpus, an impus, or a lorpus.\n\nNow let's analyze these premises to see if Sam is a wumpus:\n\nFrom premise (11), Sam could be a jompus, a tumpus, or an impus. \n- If Sam is a jompus, it doesn't directly tell us if Sam is a wumpus because being a vumpus does not necessarily mean being a wumpus.\n- If Sam is a tumpus, then from premise (9), Sam is a wumpus.\n- If Sam is an impus, then from premise (7), Sam is a wumpus.\n\nFrom premise (12), Sam could be a tumpus, an impus, or a lorpus.\n- If Sam is a tumpus, then from premise (9), Sam is a wumpus.\n- If Sam is an impus, then from premise (7), Sam is a wumpus.\n- If Sam is a lorpus, then from premise (2), Sam is a wumpus.\n\nSo, regardless of whether Sam is a jompus, a tumpus, an impus, or a lorpus, Sam is always a wumpus. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam is a wumpus based on premises (7), (9), and (2).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Sam is a wumpus is (7), (9), and (2).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(7),(9)->(13)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sam is a tumpus, an impus, or a lorpus.

Hence, Sam is a wumpus.\n\n2. **If Sam is an impus:**\n   - From Premise 6, impuses are wumpuses.

Hence, Sam is a wumpus.\n\n4. **If Sam is a jompus:**\n   - From Premise 8, every jompus is a vumpus. However, this alone does not guarantee Sam is a wumpus. But since Premise 2 already includes the possibility of Sam being a tumpus or an impus (both of which are wumpuses), we do not need to rely solely on jompuses here.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince the premises cover all cases where Sam could be a tumpus, impus, or lorpus, and these categories directly imply Sam is a wumpus, we can conclude that Sam is a wumpus.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\n- Premise 4 (Each tumpus is a wumpus)\n- Premise 6 (Impuses are wumpuses)\n- Premise 11 (Every lorpus is a wumpus)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (4),(6),(11)->(13)."}]
