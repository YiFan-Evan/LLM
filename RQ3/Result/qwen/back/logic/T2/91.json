From premise (3), since everything that is a grimpus is also either orange, blue, or a rompus, and since we don't have specific information about whether Fae is orange or blue, we can conclude that Fae is a rompus.\n3. From premise (2), since everything that is a rompus is also either dull, bright, or a lempus, we can infer that Fae is either dull, bright, or a lempus. However, this doesn't directly help us with the proof obligation.\n4. From premise (4), since everything that is a grimpus is also either kind, angry, or a yumpus, and since we already know Fae is a grimpus, we can conclude that Fae is either kind, angry, or a yumpus.\n5. From premise (6), since everything that is a yumpus is also either luminous, metallic, or a vumpus, and since we have established that Fae is a yumpus (from step 4), we can conclude that Fae is either luminous, metallic, or a vumpus.\n6.

From premise (9), since everything that is a grimpus is either transparent, opaque, or a zumpus, and since we don't have specific information about whether Fae is transparent or opaque, we conclude that Fae is a zumpus.
