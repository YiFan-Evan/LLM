Therefore, since Sally is a shumpus, she is also an impus.\n- From premise (17), all impuses are rompuses. Therefore, since Sally is an impus, she is also a rompus.\n- From premise (21), all rompuses are transparent. Therefore, since Sally is a rompus, she is transparent.\n- From premise (6), each shumpus is a wumpus. Therefore, since Sally is a shumpus, she is also a wumpus.\n- From premise (8), each wumpus is not loud. Therefore, since Sally is a wumpus, she is not loud.\n- From premise (10), each shumpus is not dull.

Therefore, from premise (4), lempuses are not sweet, and thus, since shumpuses are tumpuses, shumpuses are not sweet, and since Sally is a shumpus, she is not sweet.\n- From premise (5), each shumpus is a wumpus, and from premise (8), each wumpus is not loud. Therefore, since Sally is a shumpus, she is not loud.\n- From premise (14), each jompus is a lorpus, and from premise (9), each lorpus is kind. Therefore, from premise (3), each jompus is a tumpus, and from premise (15), each tumpus is a lempus, and from premise (17), each impus is a rompus, and from premise (6), each shumpus is a zumpus, and from premise (7), each zumpus is a dumpus, and from premise (20), each dumpus is brown, and from premise (13), each tumpus is not nervous, and from premise (11), each tumpus is not nervous, and from premise (12), each tumpus is a grimpus, and from premise (14), each jompus is a lorpus, and from premise (9), each lorpus is kind, and from premise (18), each jompus is not small.
