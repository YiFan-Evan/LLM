So, Polly, being a vumpus, is also a sterpus.\n   - Since Polly is a wumpus (from (9)), and from (4), every wumpus is an impus and a shumpus, Polly is an impus and a shumpus.\n   \n3. **Further Derivation**:\n   - From (8), sterpuses are jompuses and gorpuses. Since Polly is a sterpus (as established above), Polly must be a jompus and a gorpus.\n   - We already have that Polly is a lorpus and a rompus (from (10)).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, Polly is a gorpus.\n\nThe logical sequence leading to the conclusion that Polly is a gorpus involves using the properties of vumpuses and wumpuses, and the relationships between different types of pus entities. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(2),(8),(9),(10)->(11)**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is a lorpus and a rompus.
