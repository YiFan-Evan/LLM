Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify Rex's Categories**: From the premises, Rex belongs to several categories:\n   - Rex is a lorpus (Premise 1).\n   - Rex is a sterpus (Premise 12).\n   - Rex is a vumpus (Premise 15 and Premise 18).\n   - Rex is a numpus (Premise 19).\n   - Rex is a yumpus (Premise 20).\n   - Rex is a dumpus (Premise 10 and Premise 17).\n\n2. **Combine Categories to Determine if Rex is a Lorpus**:\n   - From Premise 8, everything that is a lorpus and a vumpus and a dumpus is a tumpus.\n   - Rex is a lorpus (Premise 1), a vumpus (Premise 15 and Premise 18), and a dumpus (Premise 10 and Premise 17).\n   - Therefore, Rex is a tumpus (from Premise 8).\n\n3. **Check Rex\u2019s Relationship with Tumpuses and Other Categories**:\n   - From Premise 5, wumpuses are tumpuses.\n   - From Premise 11, lempuses are wumpuses.\n   - From Premise 2, every wumpus is a lempus, a gorpus, and an impus.\n   - From Premise 3, each gorpus is a rompus.\n   - From Premise 7, each lempus is a rompus.\n\n4. **Derive the Conclusion about Rex being a Lempus**:\n   - If Rex were a lempus, he would also be a wumpus (from Premise 11).\n   - If Rex were a wumpus, he would be an impus (from Premise 2).\n   - From Premise 13, shumpuses are not impuses.\n   - From Premise 6, everything that is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus is a shumpus.\n   - Rex is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus (Premise 15, Premise 19, Premise 20).\n   - Therefore, Rex is a shumpus (from Premise 6).\n   - Since shumpuses are not impuses (Premise 13), Rex cannot be an impus.\n   - But if Rex were a lempus, he would be an impus (from Premise 2).\n   - Therefore, Rex cannot be a lempus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to derive this conclusion involves understanding Rex's relationship with shumpuses and impuses. Specifically, Premises 6, 13, and 2 are crucial.\n\nThus, the final answer is: (6),(13),(2)->(21)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a yumpus. (2) Rex is a numpus.

Let's break down the logical steps involved:\n\n1. **Identify Rex's Categories**:\n   - Rex is a yumpus (Premise 1).\n   - Rex is a numpus (Premise 2).\n   - Rex is a vumpus (Premise 3 and Premise 6).\n   - Rex is a dumpus (Premise 4, Premise 11, and Premise 20).\n   - Rex is a sterpus (Premise 9).\n   - Rex is a lorpus (Premise 20).\n\n2. **Determine if Rex is a shumpus**:\n   - From Premise 15, everything that is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus is a shumpus.\n   - Rex satisfies all these conditions (vumpus, numpus, yumpus).\n   - Therefore, Rex is a shumpus.\n\n3. **Analyze the Implications of Rex being a shumpus**:\n   - From Premise 8, shumpuses are not impuses.\n   - If Rex were a lempus, he would be an impus (from Premise 19 because every wumpus is an impus).\n   - Therefore, Rex cannot be a lempus since he is a shumpus and shumpuses are not impuses.\n\n4. **Verify Rex's Category as a tumpus**:\n   - From Premise 12, everything that is a lorpus and a vumpus and a dumpus is a tumpus.\n   - Rex is a lorpus, a vumpus, and a dumpus.\n   - Therefore, Rex is a tumpus.\n\n5. **Connect tumpuses with wumpuses**:\n   - From Premise 16, wumpuses are tumpuses.\n   - From Premise 10, lempuses are wumpuses.\n   - Thus, if Rex were a lempus, he would be a wumpus and consequently a tumpus.\n\nSince Rex is already established as a tumpus through other premises, there is no contradiction here. However, the key contradiction comes from Rex being a shumpus and not an impus, which rules out him being a lempus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to derive that Rex is not a lempus involves understanding Rex's relationship with shumpuses and impuses, specifically Premises 8, 15, and 19.\n\nThus, the final answer is: (8),(15),(19)->(21)."}]
