Since she is a rompus, she is also a tumpus and a numpus (from premise 7).\n    \n12. **Sally is a yumpus and Sally is a brimpus and Sally is not a numpus.**\n    - This tells us that Sally is a yumpus and a brimpus, but she is not a numpus. However, we already know from premise 11 that she is a numpus, so there seems to be a contradiction here. Nonetheless, let's proceed with the assumption that premise 12 overrides premise 11 regarding the numpus status.\n    \nGiven that Sally is a yumpus (premise 12), and yumpuses are vumpuses (premise 8), Sally is a vumpus. Also, since each brimpus is a lorpus (premise 4), and lorpus or shumpus or grimpus is a vumpus (premise 6), Sally being a brimpus means she is a lorpus, which makes her a vumpus.\n\nNow, we need to determine if Sally can be an impus. If Sally were an impus, she would be a shumpus (premise 5), and hence a vumpus (premise 6). But if she were an impus, she would also be a gorpus (premise 10).\n\nHowever, since Sally is not a numpus (premise 12), and everything that is a sterpus, zumpus, or impus is a gorpus (premise 10), and every dumpus, shumpus, or wumpus is a numpus (premise 9), and since Sally is a vumpus (premise 8), she cannot be an impus because it would make her a gorpus and not a numpus, which contradicts premise 12.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (3),(4),(12)->(13)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sally is a yumpus and Sally is a brimpus and Sally is not a numpus.

Therefore, since Sally is a rompus, she is a numpus.\n- However, from premise 1, we know Sally is not a numpus. This creates a contradiction if we assume Sally is an impus.\n- If Sally were an impus, then from premise 8, she would be a shumpus. From premise 7, since she is a lorpus (from premise 9), she would be a vumpus. Since she is already a vumpus (from premise 2), this does not create a contradiction yet.\n- However, from premise 12, if Sally is an impus, she is a tumpus. But from premise 1, since she is not a numpus, she cannot be an impus without creating a contradiction.\n- Therefore, Sally cannot be an impus.\n\nThus, the final answer is: (1),(2),(10)->(13)"}]
