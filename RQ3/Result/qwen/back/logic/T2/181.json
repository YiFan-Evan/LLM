We need to check if Rex can be any of these.\n\nLet's go through the logical steps:\n\n- From premise (12), Rex is a tumpus.\n- From premise (9), every wumpus is a tumpus. This means Rex being a wumpus would imply Rex is a tumpus, but not vice versa.\n- From premise (6), every jompus is a wumpus, so if Rex is a jompus, then Rex must be a wumpus.\n- From premise (9), if Rex is a wumpus, Rex must be a tumpus, which is already known from premise (12).\n- From premise (6), every jompus is a numpus. So if Rex is a jompus, Rex must be a numpus.\n- From premise (10), every numpus is a lorpus. So if Rex is a jompus, Rex must be a lorpus.\n- From premise (11), every vumpus is a lorpus. So if Rex is a jompus, Rex must be a lorpus.\n- From premise (13), Rex is a vumpus. Therefore, if Rex is a jompus, Rex must be a lorpus, which is consistent.\n- From premise (6), every jompus is a dumpus. So if Rex is a jompus, Rex must be a dumpus.\n- From premise (2), every dumpus is a zumpus. So if Rex is a jompus, Rex must be a zumpus.\n- From premise (1), Rex is a zumpus. This is consistent.\n- From premise (4), every zumpus is a gorpus. So if Rex is a jompus, Rex must be a gorpus.\n- But from premise (13), Rex is not a gorpus.
