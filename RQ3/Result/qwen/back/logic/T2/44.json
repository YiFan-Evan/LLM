Specifically, we need to determine if Alex can be classified as a brimpus based on the given information.\n\nHere are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Brimpus Classification**: A brimpus is defined as a jompus, numpus, and zumpus.\n2. **Alex's Classification**:\n   - Alex is a tumpus.\n   - Alex is a wumpus.\n   - Alex is an impus.\n   - Alex is a shumpus.\n   - Alex is a lempus.\n   - Alex is a gorpus.\n   - Alex is not a numpus.\n\nFrom the premises, we know:\n- Every tumpus is a numpus (Premise 4).\n- Alex is a tumpus (Premise 7).\n- Therefore, Alex is a numpus.\n- But Premise 10 states that Alex is not a numpus.\n\nThis creates a contradiction because Alex cannot simultaneously be a tumpus (and therefore a numpus) and not a numpus. However, let's focus on the classification of brimpus:\n- Every brimpus is a shumpus (Premise 6).\n- Every brimpus is a jompus (by definition, Premise 5).\n- Every brimpus is a numpus (by definition, Premise 5).\n\nSince Alex is not a numpus (Premise 10), Alex cannot be a brimpus because being a brimpus requires being a numpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is a lempus and Alex is not a numpus and Alex is a gorpus.
