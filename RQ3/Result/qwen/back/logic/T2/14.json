Specifically, we need to establish that Stella, who is defined in terms of certain categories, is necessarily a wumpus based on the premises provided.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the categories of Stella**: According to premise (11) and (12), Stella is either a brimpus, jompus, or numpus, or alternatively, she could be a tumpus, brimpus, or jompus.\n2. **Check if these categories imply being a wumpus**:\n   - From premise (1), each brimpus is a wumpus.\n   - From premise (2), every jompus is a wumpus.\n   - From premise (7), numpuses are wumpuses.\n   - From premise (10), every numpus is a rompus.\n   - From premise (8), tumpuses are rompuses.\n   - From premise (6), each brimpus is a rompus.\n   - From premise (9), jompuses are rompuses.\n3. **Derive the relationship between rompus and wumpus**: Since brimpuses, jompuses, and numpuses are all rompuses and each rompus is a wumpus, it follows that any of these categories implies being a wumpus.\n4. **Conclusion**: Given that Stella falls into one of the categories (brimpus, jompus, numpus, tumpus) that are all ultimately wumpuses, we can conclude that Stella is a wumpus.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Stella is a wumpus involves premises (1), (2), (7), (8), (9), (10), and (11) or (12).\n\nHowever, since the specific combination of categories in premises (11) and (12) ensures that Stella is covered by at least one category that is a wumpus, we can simplify the solution by focusing on the core relationships established by premises (1), (2), (7), (8), (9), and (10).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises that directly leads to the conclusion that Stella is a wumpus is (1), (2), (7), (8), (9), and (10).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(7),(8),(9),(10)->(13)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Stella is a tumpus, a brimpus, or a jompus.
