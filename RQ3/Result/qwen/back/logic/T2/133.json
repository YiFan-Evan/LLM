Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the key relationships involving Polly**:\n   - Polly is a zumpus (from Premise 5).\n   - Polly is a lempus (from Premise 10).\n   - Polly is a lorpus (from Premise 10).\n   - Polly is a tumpus (from Premise 10).\n   - Polly is a wumpus (from Premise 10).\n\n2. **Use the properties of zumpus and rompus**:\n   - From Premise 7, every zumpus is a rompus. Since Polly is a zumpus, Polly is also a rompus.\n   - From Premise 8, lorpuses are not rompuses. Since Polly is a lorpus, Polly cannot be a rompus.\n\n3. **Derive a contradiction if Polly were a vumpus**:\n   - If Polly were a vumpus, then based on Premise 1, Polly would be a rompus because everything that is a vumpus is a rompus.\n   - However, we already know from Premise 8 that Polly cannot be a rompus because Polly is a lorpus.\n\nSince assuming Polly is a vumpus leads to a contradiction (Polly being both a rompus and not a rompus), Polly cannot be a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (5),(7),(8),(10)->(12)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is a tumpus, a lorpus, and a wumpus.
