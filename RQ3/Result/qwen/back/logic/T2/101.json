Here\u2019s a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Identify the Properties of Wren**: From the premises, we know:\n   - Wren is opaque and a lempus and a grimpus (Premise 9).\n   - Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus (Premise 10).\n\n2. **Analyze the Definitions of Other Umpuses**:\n   - Lempuses are spicy and brimpuses and grimpuses (Premise 4).\n   - Grimpuses are feisty and shumpuses and rompuses (Premise 2).\n   - Brimpuses are blue, yumpuses, and jompuses (Premise 3).\n   - Yumpuses are bright and zumpuses and numpuses (Premise 5).\n   - Jompuses are temperate, wumpuses, and tumpuses (Premise 6).\n   - Wumpuses are sunny, sterpuses, and impuses (Premise 7).\n   - Dumpuses are small and large and gorpus (Premise 8).\n\n3. **Derive the Conclusion**:\n   - Since Wren is a lempus (Premise 9) and lempuses are brimpuses and grimpuses (Premise 4), we know Wren is a brimpus or a grimpus.\n   - Since Wren is also a grimpus (Premise 9), and since being a grimpus does not exclude being a brimpus, we need to check if Wren can be a brimpus.\n   - We know from Premise 10 that Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus. This matches the definition of a wumpus (Premise 7), which is a subset of a jompus, which is a subset of a brimpus (from Premise 3).\n\nThus, combining these observations:\n- Wren is a lempus (Premise 9).\n- Lempuses are brimpuses (Premise 4).\n- Therefore, Wren is a brimpus.\n\nThe minimal set of premises needed to derive the conclusion is:\n- Premise 9 (Wren is opaque and a lempus and a grimpus)\n- Premise 4 (Lempuses are spicy and brimpuses and grimpuses)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (9),(4)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus.

Here\u2019s a step-by-step analysis:\n\n1. **Properties of Wren**:\n   - Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus (Premise 1).\n   - Wren is opaque and a lempus and a grimpus (Premise 2).\n\n2. **Definitions of Other Types**:\n   - Wumpuses are sunny, sterpuses, and impuses (Premise 4).\n   - Jompuses are temperate, wumpuses, and tumpuses (Premise 5).\n   - Yumpuses are bright, zumpuses, and numpuses (Premise 6).\n   - Lempuses are spicy and brimpuses and grimpuses (Premise 7).\n   - Brimpuses are blue, yumpuses, and jompuses (Premise 8).\n   - Grimpuses are feisty, shumpuses, and rompuses (Premise 9).\n   - Vumpuses are opaque and lempuses (Premise 10).\n\n3. **Connecting the Properties**:\n   - Since Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus (Premise 1), it matches the definition of a wumpus (Premise 4).\n   - Since Wren is a lempus (Premise 2), and lempuses are brimpuses and grimpuses (Premise 7), Wren must be either a brimpus or a grimpus.\n   - Given Wren is already identified as a wumpus (by matching Premise 1), and knowing that every wumpus is a jompus (Premise 5), we can infer more about Wren's properties.\n   - Since brimpuses are defined as blue, yumpuses, and jompuses (Premise 8), and jompuses are temperate, wumpuses, and tumpuses (Premise 5), and wumpuses match the properties of Wren (sunny, sterpus, and impus), Wren could potentially fit into the brimpus category.\n\nTo derive the conclusion that Wren is a brimpus, we need to use the premises that directly link Wren to the properties of brimpuses. Specifically:\n\n- Wren is a lempus (Premise 2).\n- Lempuses are brimpuses and grimpuses (Premise 7).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Wren is a brimpus is:\n- Premise 2 (Wren is opaque and a lempus and a grimpus)\n- Premise 7 (Lempuses are spicy and brimpuses and grimpuses)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(7)->(11)."}]
