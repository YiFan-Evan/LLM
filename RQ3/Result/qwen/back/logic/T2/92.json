This does not apply to Max because Max is a shumpus, not an impus.\n   - From (17): Everything that is bright and dull and an impus is a grimpus. However, Max is a shumpus, not an impus.\n   - From (18): Everything that is loud, discordant, and a grimpus is a numpus. To use this, we need to establish that Max is a grimpus first.\n   - From (11): Everything that is snowy and sunny and a shumpus is a lorpus.

To satisfy this, we need to show that Max is a grimpus first.\n\n4. **Establishing Max as a grimpus**:\n   - Since Max is a shumpus, we need to check if any premises about shumpuses lead to grimpuses or other relevant categories.\n   - There is no direct path from shumpus to grimpus via the given premises.\n\nGiven the current premises, there is no clear way to directly conclude that Max is a grimpus. However, we can try to use the indirect approach:\n\n- From (18): If we assume Max is a grimpus, then he would be a numpus.\n- But there is no direct path to proving Max is a grimpus.\n\nSince the premises do not provide a clear path to establishing Max as a grimpus, the proof cannot be completed based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: None of the premises directly lead to proving Max is a grimpus.
