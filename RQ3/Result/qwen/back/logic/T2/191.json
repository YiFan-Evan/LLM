Since Alex is a wumpus (from Premise (11)), Alex is also a sterpus (already known from Premise (10)).\n   - From Premise (11), Alex is a vumpus.\n   - From Premise (4), every vumpus is a tumpus. Therefore, since Alex is a vumpus, Alex is a tumpus (already known from Premise (10)).\n   - From Premise (6), vumpuses are zumpuses, grimpuses, and lempuses. Therefore, Alex is a zumpus, a grimpus, and a lempus.\n   - From Premise (5), zumpuses are numpuses. Therefore, Alex is a zumpus and hence a numpus.\n   - From Premise (7), lempuses are brimpuses.
