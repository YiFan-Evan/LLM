However, this doesn't directly help us with proving Max is sour or a tumpus.\n5. Using premise (6) again, since Max is a Grimpus, we can apply premise (5): Shy \u2228 Grimpus \u2192 Tumpus. This means Max is a Tumpus because he is a Grimpus.\n6. Now we have established that Max is a Tumpus. According to premise (4), Sour \u2228 Tumpus \u2192 Gorpus, if Max is a Tumpus, then the condition \"Sour \u2228 Tumpus\" is satisfied, making the consequent Gorpus true.
