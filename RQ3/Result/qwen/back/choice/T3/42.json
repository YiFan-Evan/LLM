Write sentences on paper - This action uses the pen but does not prevent it from drying out.\nB. Ink in - While pens do use ink, this option doesn't specify how the ink is applied or maintained, and it\u2019s not an item that can be placed on the pen.\nC. Ink cartridges - These are components that supply ink to the pen but are not something you would put on a pen to prevent it from drying out.\nD. Caps - Pen caps are commonly used to cover the writing end of the pen, which helps prevent the ink from drying out by reducing evaporation.\nE.

Pens need a consistent supply of ink to write effectively, and they must be stored properly to prevent the ink from drying out. Among the options provided, we need to identify which one directly addresses the prevention of ink drying.\n\nLet's analyze each option again:\n\nA. Write sentences on paper \u2013 This action uses the pen but does not prevent it from drying out.\nB. Ink in \u2013 While pens do use ink, this option doesn't specify how the ink is applied or maintained, and it\u2019s not an item that can be placed on the pen.\nC. Ink cartridges \u2013 These are components that supply ink to the pen. Although the model has identified that \"ink cartridges\" are associated with writing actions, they are not something you put on the pen to prevent it from drying out; rather, they are a part of the pen itself.\nD. Caps \u2013 Pen caps are commonly used to cover the writing end of the pen, which helps prevent the ink from drying out by reducing evaporation.\nE. Cling film \u2013 While cling film could potentially cover the pen, it is not a practical or common method for preventing a pen from drying out.\n\nGiven the analysis, the correct choice for preventing a pen from drying out is the cap, as it covers the nib and reduces evaporation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}]
