An \"area of elevation\" refers to a geographical feature such as a mountain or plateau that rises above the surrounding land.

Reduction - This can refer to a decrease in size but does not specifically relate to geographic features.\nC. Depression - In geography, a \"depression\" is a low area of land, often surrounded by higher ground. This matches well with the concept of an area of elevation's opposite.\nD. Demotion - This typically refers to a reduction in rank or position and is not relevant here.\nE. Diminishment - Similar to reduction, this is a general term for decrease and does not specifically relate to geographic features.\n\nGiven these explanations, the best fit is option C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the opposite of an area of elevation?
