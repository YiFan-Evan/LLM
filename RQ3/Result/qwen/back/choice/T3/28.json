In Christianity, being \"born again\" is a concept derived from the Bible, specifically from the Gospel of John, where Jesus tells Nicodemus that one must be \"born again\" to see the kingdom of God. This process typically involves repentance, faith, and baptism, leading to a spiritual transformation.\n\nGiven these principles, we can evaluate the options:\n\nA. Unable to work - This is not a condition for going to heaven.\nB. Born again - This aligns with Christian teachings about salvation.\nC. Change of color - This has no theological significance in Christianity.\nD. Dead - Being dead does not equate to salvation or going to heaven.\nE. No longer exist - This also has no theological basis in Christianity regarding salvation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Christians believe you will go to heaven if you're what?
