The key point here is the lack of a personal vehicle, which implies that James is relying on some form of public or shared transportation to move around. A duffel bag is commonly used for carrying personal items when traveling or commuting.\n\nNow let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **A. library**: Libraries are places for reading and studying, and do not involve travel.\n- **B. transit**: Transit refers to the act of moving from one place to another, often using public transportation like buses or trains.\n- **C. bus station**: A bus station is a place where people board and disembark from buses, but it's specific to buses only.\n- **D. army barracks**: Army barracks are living quarters for soldiers, unrelated to James\u2019s need for transportation.\n- **E. locker room**: Locker rooms are facilities where people change clothes or store belongings, typically associated with sports or fitness centers, and not related to travel.\n\nGiven the context, the most appropriate choice would be an option that involves some form of public or shared transportation.
