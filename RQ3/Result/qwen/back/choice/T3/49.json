To understand the man's feelings, we must consider the contrast between his physical surroundings (large crowds) and his emotional experience (depressed).\n\n- \"Small group\" does not align with the presence of \"large crowds.\"\n- \"Alone\" and \"solitary\" both suggest a feeling of isolation, which can be experienced even in a crowd if someone feels disconnected from others.\n- \"Solitude\" typically implies being alone or isolated, but it can also refer to a state of being alone without necessarily feeling lonely.\n- \"Panic\" suggests an intense feeling of fear or anxiety, which doesn't fit the description of depression.\n\nGiven that the man is described as depressed, it's more likely that he feels disconnected from the crowd despite being surrounded by people.

The key point here is understanding the emotional state of a depressed individual. Depression often involves feelings of isolation or disconnection from others, even when physically among many people. \n\nAmong the options provided:\n- A. \"small group\" does not fit because the man is actually in a large crowd.\n- B. \"alone\" aligns well with the idea of feeling isolated despite being surrounded by people.\n- C. \"solitary\" also conveys a sense of being alone, but it is slightly less common in everyday language compared to \"alone.\"\n- D. \"solitude\" implies a state of being alone, but it is more about the condition of being alone rather than the feeling of being alone.\n- E. \"panic\" does not match the depressive mood described.\n\nGiven that \"alone\" best captures the feeling of isolation that a depressed person might experience in a crowd, it is the most appropriate choice.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. alone"}]
