Immortality refers to the ability to live forever without dying. Therefore, the opposite of an immortal being would be someone who can die, i.e., a person with a finite lifespan.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- **A. mortal**: This term accurately describes a person who is subject to death and does not possess immortality.\n- **B. dying**: This word generally describes the process of approaching death but doesn\u2019t fully describe a person\u2019s state.\n- **C. death**: This is a noun referring to the end of life, not a description of a person.\n- **D. dead**: This describes the state of having ceased to be alive, rather than the ongoing condition of being able to die.\n- **E. mortal**: This is repeated and matches option A.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is a person called who doesn't have immortality?

Immortality means living forever, so a person who does not have immortality must be subject to death at some point.
