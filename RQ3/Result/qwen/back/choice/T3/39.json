Generally, tickets for seats are purchased for events or venues where there is a designated seating arrangement. This implies that the venue or event must have a specific layout or plan for seating.\n\n- **A. Park**: Parks typically do not require tickets for entry, let alone tickets for specific seats.\n- **B. Show**: Shows, such as theater performances, concerts, or other live entertainment events, often require tickets for specific seats.\n- **C. Auditorium**: While an auditorium does have seats, it's not typically associated with purchasing tickets unless it's for a specific event like a concert or lecture.\n- **D. Movies**: Movie theaters do sell tickets for specific seats, though some may offer reserved seating while others are general admission.\n- **E. Rest Area**: Rest areas are typically free and do not require tickets for use.\n\nConsidering these points, both \"show\" and \"movies\" can be valid answers. However, since \"show\" more broadly encompasses various types of seated events, it is a more inclusive answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What event might one buy tickets for seats?
