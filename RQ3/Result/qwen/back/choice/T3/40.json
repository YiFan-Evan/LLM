Movie:** This is pre-recorded entertainment played on a screen, not live.\n- **B. Show:** This can include live performances like plays, comedy acts, or variety shows.\n- **C. Concert Venue:** While concerts are live, the term \"concert venue\" refers more to the place rather than the entertainment itself.\n- **D. Casino:** Entertainment here can be live (like stand-up comedy), but it's not specifically known for live performances.\n- **E.

Additionally, the presence of the word \"touristic_area\" suggests that the model may be taking into account the popularity of theatres in areas that attract tourists. The word \"single_ticket\" may indicate the preference for attending shows individually or with a smaller group, rather than in a large crowd, as is often the case with concerts or casinos.
