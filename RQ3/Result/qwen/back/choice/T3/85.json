In such conditions, especially during harsh weather, the noise from the boat's motor could be quite loud, potentially drowning out Joe\u2019s cries for help.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- **A. Surface of earth**: Irrelevant to the scenario.\n- **B. Teardrops**: Unlikely to create significant noise.\n- **C. Snowflake**: Falling snowflakes do not produce much sound.\n- **D. Typhoon**: While possible, the question specifies it's winter, and typhoons typically occur in warmer climates.\n- **E.
