(Since the top reason-word \"acquiring_friends\" is closely related to the question's context of \"making friends\", it could be concluded that the person in the question finds good feeling in acquiring friends.

An outgoing person typically enjoys social interactions and finds making friends a positive and rewarding experience. Therefore, we can infer that making friends is not associated with anything negative like being \"scary,\" \"conflict,\" or even the abstract concept of \"friendship.\" \n\nAmong the options provided:\n- A. \"scary\" implies fear or discomfort, which does not align with the outgoing personality's traits.\n- B. \"having friends\" is not a suitable choice because it is not something that can be considered a personal trait or experience.\n- C. \"good feeling\" implies a positive experience, which fits well with an outgoing person's attitude towards making friends.\n- D. \"conflict\" suggests disagreement or trouble, which would contradict the idea of an outgoing person enjoying social interactions.\n- E. \"friendship\" is a noun and does not fit the grammatical structure of the sentence.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most fitting option is \"C. good feeling.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}]
