Chest tightness can be a symptom of various health conditions, some of which may require immediate medical attention. However, since Jodie does not want to go to the hospital, we need to identify a place where she could potentially seek help or at least feel more comfortable.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Istanbul - This is a city and not a place where one would typically seek medical help.\nB. Concert - While this might be a place to relax, it is not appropriate for someone experiencing chest tightness.\nC. Bedroom - Although staying in a comfortable environment might help, it does not address the potential health issue.\nD. Antique shop - This is unrelated to seeking medical assistance.\nE. Human being - This is vague, but if interpreted as seeking help from another person, it could imply contacting someone who can offer assistance or advice.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate choice for seeking help without going to the hospital would be contacting another person who can provide guidance or support.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Jodie felt a tightness in her chest.
