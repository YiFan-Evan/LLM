Cats are known for several physical features and behaviors, but some are more distinctive and commonly recognized than others.\n\n- **Whiskers (A)**: While whiskers are a notable feature of cats, they are not unique to cats and are shared with other animals.\n- **Sharp Teeth (B)**: Cats do have sharp teeth, which they use for hunting and eating. However, this characteristic is not as defining as some others.\n- **Purr (C)**: Purring is a well-known behavior of cats, but it's not exclusive to them and can be less broadly representative of cats compared to other features.\n- **Four Legs (D)**: All cats do indeed have four legs, but like whiskers, this characteristic is common to many mammals and is not particularly distinctive of cats.\n- **Sharp Claws (E)**: Sharp claws are a defining characteristic of cats, used for hunting, climbing, and self-defense. This feature is highly associated with the typical image and behavior of a cat.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What are cats often known for?
