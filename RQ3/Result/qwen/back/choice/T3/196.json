Turkey spans two continents, Europe and Asia. The larger part of the country is situated in Asia, known as Anatolia or Asia Minor. However, a smaller portion of Turkey extends into southeastern Europe, particularly the Balkan Peninsula.\n\nHere\u2019s a closer look at each option:\n\n- **A. Middle East**: While Turkey is culturally and historically considered part of the Middle East, its geographical position does not place a significant portion of its landmass within the Middle East.\n- **B. Oven**: This option is nonsensical in the context of geography.\n- **C. Balkan Peninsula**: This is correct because the northern part of Turkey is indeed in the Balkan Peninsula.\n- **D. Provide Meat**: This option is irrelevant to the geographical context.\n- **E. Asia Minor**: This term refers to the Asian part of Turkey, not the European part.\n\nBased on this analysis, the small northern part of Turkey is located in the Balkan Peninsula.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. Balkan Peninsula."}]
