The keyboard of an organ can be considered as having divisions depending on how the organ is designed and played.\n\nGiven these explanations, the correct answer is related to an instrument that has a keyboard controlling pipe divisions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: WHat type of keyboard is made up of one or more pipe divisions?
