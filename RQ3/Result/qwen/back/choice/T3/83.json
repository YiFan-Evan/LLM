Self-assurance is generally associated with confidence and a positive self-image. When someone is self-assured, they tend to have faith in their own abilities and decisions, which leads them to exhibit certain behaviors.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n- **A. acknowledgment**: This means recognizing or accepting something. While a self-assured person might acknowledge their strengths, this isn't the defining trait.\n- **B. focused**: Being focused is a general trait that can apply to many people, not just self-assured ones.\n- **C. know what time**: This doesn't make sense in the context of self-assurance.\n- **D. feel important**: Feeling important could be a result of being self-assured, but it's more about perception than a core characteristic.\n- **E. trust himself**: Trusting oneself is a fundamental aspect of being self-assured. It involves believing in one\u2019s own judgment and capabilities.\n\nGiven these explanations, the most appropriate answer is the one that directly aligns with the core characteristic of self-assurance.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What does a self assured person often do?
