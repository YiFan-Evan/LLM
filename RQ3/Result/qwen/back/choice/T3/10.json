In this context, the fundamental principle involves understanding the inverse relationship between shrinking and growing.

However, they used the shrink ray incorrectly, which would have the opposite effect. Given the context, \"gain weight\" does not align perfectly with the intended action of reducing size; instead, the incorrect use of the shrink ray would likely result in the person becoming larger, either in size or possibly in weight if we interpret \"shrink ray\" as something that affects both size and mass inversely.\n\nHowever, considering the reasoning provided that emphasizes the concept of \"lightness\" and \"degrowth,\" the most fitting option that aligns with the idea of an inverse effect on weight (or perceived lightness) would be gaining weight.
