The key elements here are:\n\n1. \"more than one bum asking for change or a ticket\" - This suggests that there are homeless people or individuals who might not have enough money looking for assistance or transportation.\n2. \"the cheapest way to travel\" - This indicates that we're talking about a mode of transportation that is affordable for everyone, including those without much money.\n\nGiven these points, let's analyze the options:\n- A. Train Station: While trains can be a relatively inexpensive mode of travel, they aren't typically known as the cheapest form of public transport.\n- B. Beach: It doesn't make sense in the context of the question as it isn't related to transportation.\n- C. Bus Depot: Buses are often the most affordable form of public transportation, making them accessible to a wide range of people, including those who may not have much money.\n- D. Bridge: Bridges are not modes of transportation but rather structures connecting two places.\n- E. Stumblebum: This term refers to a homeless person or someone who appears disheveled, which does not fit the context of the question.\n\nConsidering these explanations, the most logical answer would be the place where buses are commonly found, as they are known for being the cheapest way to travel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: There was more than one bum asking for change or a ticket, it was the cheapest way to travel so it was no surprise sight at the what?

Train Station: Train stations can indeed be places where people ask for money or tickets, and while trains can be relatively cheap, they are not always the cheapest form of transportation.\n- B. Beach: This option does not fit the context of people asking for money or tickets.\n- C. Bus Depot: Bus depots are common places where people ask for money or tickets, and buses are often the cheapest form of public transportation.\n- D. Bridge: Bridges are not locations where people typically gather to travel by public transport.\n- E.
