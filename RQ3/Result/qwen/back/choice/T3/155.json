The question highlights that Joan, being a baby, had many limitations, which caused problems for her parents. One of the key limitations mentioned is the inability to walk.\n\nLet's break down each option:\n\n- **A. Arrive early**: While premature birth can certainly cause complications, the question focuses on the typical developmental stages of a baby.\n- **B. Learn to walk**: This is a developmental milestone, and before reaching this stage, babies are not mobile on their own. Parents must carry or assist them frequently, which can be physically demanding.\n- **C. Boy or girl**: This is a biological trait and not something that creates practical challenges in daily parenting.\n- **D. Bring joy**: While bringing joy is a positive aspect of having a baby, it is not a challenge.\n- **E. Talk nonsense**: Babies cannot speak coherently, which can be a communication challenge, but this is less directly about physical mobility compared to walking.\n\nGiven these considerations, the inability to walk means that parents must constantly lift and carry the baby, making this a significant practical challenge.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
