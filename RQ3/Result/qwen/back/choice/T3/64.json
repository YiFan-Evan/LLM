The question is asking us to choose the word that best describes the state of the butt, particularly emphasizing its visibility since it's bare.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- A. \"full\" \u2013 This describes the size or roundness but does not directly address the visibility of the bare condition.\n- B. \"ample\" \u2013 This means plentiful or abundant, which can also describe the size or quantity, fitting well for describing a noticeable feature.\n- C. \"covered\" \u2013 This is contradictory to the given condition that the butt was bare.\n- D. \"bareword\" \u2013 This is not a commonly used term and does not fit the context.\n- E. \"ample\" \u2013 This is a repeat of option B.\n\nSince the butt is described as bare, we are looking for an adjective that emphasizes the noticeable feature due to its uncovered state. Both \"full\" and \"ample\" can describe the size, but \"ample\" is repeated and more suitable in this context because it can imply a noticeable feature.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. ample"}]
