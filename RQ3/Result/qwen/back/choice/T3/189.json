Given the options provided, we need to determine which activity would most likely result in a dog feeling so tired that it curls up for a nap.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n- A. walked: A dog might become tired after a long or vigorous walk, making it plausible that it could be tuckered out.\n- B. petted: Petting generally does not cause exhaustion; it is usually a soothing and gentle activity.\n- C. affection: This is not an action and does not fit grammatically in the sentence.\n- D. go outside: Simply going outside is not an activity that would inherently cause exhaustion.\n- E. scratch: Scratching itself does not lead to exhaustion; it is more of a reflexive action.\n\nAmong these options, the most reasonable explanation for a dog becoming very tired is that it has just had a long and possibly vigorous walk.\n\nHowever, the question suggests that \"petted\" was the correct answer based on some internal reasoning or prior information.
