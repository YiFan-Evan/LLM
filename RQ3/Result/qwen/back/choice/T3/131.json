Chess is a mind sport that requires concentration and strategic thinking. The conditions under which the game is played, such as the temperature, can affect a player's performance.\n\n- **Enemies**: This option does not directly relate to the physical or mental impact of playing chess in a cold environment.\n- **Perform better**: It is unlikely that a cold environment would improve a player's performance since comfort and warmth generally enhance cognitive functions.\n- **Sweat**: Sweating typically occurs during physical exertion or in hot environments, which is not common during a chess game.\n- **Tension**: Playing chess can create mental tension due to the pressure of making the right moves. However, this option doesn't specifically relate to the cold environment.\n- **Frostbite**: Frostbite is a medical condition caused by exposure to cold temperatures. If a player's hands are exposed to very cold temperatures, they could potentially suffer from frostbite.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most relevant negative effect of playing chess in a cold environment is related to the cold itself rather than the nature of the game.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What negative effect can competing in a chess game on a cold day have?
