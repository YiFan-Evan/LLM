Horses are typically judged on their physical attributes, such as conformation, muscle tone, and overall health, in settings where breeders and judges can closely examine them. Such settings are more likely to be controlled environments rather than open fields or natural settings like a countryside.\n\n- **A. Race track**: This is primarily for racing performance, not appearance.\n- **B. Fair**: Fairs often host horse shows or competitions where horses are judged based on their appearance.\n- **C. Raised by humans**: This is a general statement about the environment in which horses might be raised and does not directly relate to judging.\n- **D.
