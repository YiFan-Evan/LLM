Clapping is a common social behavior used to express approval, enjoyment, or admiration for a performance or event.\n\n- **Cinema** and **movies** are typically consumed silently, although audiences might applaud at the end of a film screening, especially in special circumstances like film festivals or premieres. However, it's not a regular occurrence.\n- **Theatre** performances often involve applause from the audience, particularly at the end of a play or after a particularly good performance by an actor.\n- **Show** can encompass various forms of entertainment including theater, concerts, and other live performances where clapping is a typical reaction from the audience.\n- **Hockey game** is a sporting event where cheering and applause can occur, but it's not as directly tied to individual performances as in theater or shows.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most inclusive and direct answer would be related to performances where the audience is specifically there to enjoy a live act.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What do audiences clap for?
