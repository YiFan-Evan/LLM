They are generally easy to read because they serve daily, practical purposes.\n- **Sheet Music (B)**: Sheet music is designed to be readable by musicians, so while some may find it complex, it's not inherently difficult to read.\n- **Desk (C)**: Notes on a desk can vary widely in readability but are generally meant to be understandable by the person who wrote them or anyone nearby.\n- **Bed (D)**: Notes left on a bed might be personal or informal, but they're not particularly known for being hard to read.\n- **Medical Chart (E)**: Medical charts often contain technical jargon, abbreviations, and handwriting that can be challenging even for trained professionals to decipher. \n\nGiven these considerations, the hardest to read notes are most likely to be found in medical charts due to their complexity and the nature of the information recorded.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where is hard to read note likely to be?
