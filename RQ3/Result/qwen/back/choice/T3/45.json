Clerk**: A person who works at a counter, often in a store or office, but not a place where you would find a ticket booth or see a concert.\n- **B. Indoors**: This is a general term indicating an indoor location, but it\u2019s too vague and does not specify a particular type of place.\n- **C. Movie Theater**: While it has a ticket booth, it is not a typical place for concerts.\n- **D. Venue**: This is a general term for a place where events take place, including concerts, and often has a ticket booth.\n- **E.
