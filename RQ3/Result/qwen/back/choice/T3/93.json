Coins are often inserted into devices or containers that require payment for their services or have a collection purpose. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Stove - A stove is an appliance used for cooking and does not require coins to function.\nB. Water fountain - A water fountain is designed to dispense water when activated, and some public water fountains require coins to operate.\nC. Desk - A desk is a piece of furniture used for working or studying and does not typically involve coins.\nD. Purse - A purse is used to carry coins and other items but does not use coins to function.\nE. Jar - A jar is a container used to store items, including coins, but it does not require coins to function.\n\nGiven these explanations, the most logical choice is B.
