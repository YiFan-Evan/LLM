The key here is to identify which option represents something that can be purchased and used for storage purposes.\n\n- Option A (basement): This is typically a part of a building and not something you would purchase at a shop.\n- Option B (cardboard box): This is a common item found in shops that can be used for storing things.\n- Option C (ocean floor): This is not a purchasable item and is irrelevant to storing spare unused items.\n- Option D (high school): This is an educational institution and not something that can be bought for storage.\n- Option E (container): Similar to a cardboard box, containers are commonly sold in shops and can be used for storage.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: At a shop what can you buy to put your spare unused things?
