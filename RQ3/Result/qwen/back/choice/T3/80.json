The options provided suggest different activities, but not all of them necessarily contribute to personal growth or life change.\n\n- **A. Face problems**: While facing problems is a part of life and overcoming them can lead to growth, it doesn't directly imply an active effort towards self-improvement.\n- **B. Better themselves**: This implies actively working on personal development, learning new skills, improving habits, and making conscious efforts to enhance one\u2019s quality of life.\n- **C. Pay bills**: While important for maintaining stability, paying bills does not inherently involve changing one's life in a broader sense.\n- **D. Become disillusioned**: Becoming disillusioned often leads to feelings of disappointment and cynicism rather than positive change.\n- **E.
