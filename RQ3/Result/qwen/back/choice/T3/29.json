These are common school supplies that students typically use daily for their studies. Given that these items are not already available at home (or in a specific location like a classroom or cabinet), they would need to be acquired from a place where such items are sold.\n\n- Option A (classroom): While classrooms do contain these items, parents generally don't visit classrooms to get supplies.\n- Option B (parking garage): This is not a relevant place for purchasing school supplies.\n- Option C (store): Stores, especially stationary or office supply stores, sell these items.\n- Option D (backpack): The backpack is where the student might carry these items but isn't a place to acquire them.\n- Option E (cabinet): Similar to the backpack, a cabinet might store these items if already obtained but isn\u2019t a place to get them.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: If student got a list of supplies from class like paper and pencils, their parent would have to go where?
