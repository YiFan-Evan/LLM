The concept here involves understanding perspective and relative positioning.\n\n1. **Perspective and Relative Positioning**: When an object rises from your viewpoint, it means that the object appears to be moving upwards relative to your position. This implies that if you observe something rising, you must be positioned in such a way that the object ascends relative to you.\n\n2. **Interpreting the Options**:\n   - **A. sun set**: This is not a positional term but rather refers to a phenomenon.\n   - **B. near**: Being near an object does not necessarily mean you would see it rise unless it's moving upwards relative to you.\n   - **C. fall**: This is not a position but an action or state of descending.\n   - **D. below**: If you are below an object, the object would indeed appear to rise as you look upward.\n   - **E. lower**: Similar to \"below,\" being lower than an object would mean you are looking up at it.\n\nConsidering these points, the correct interpretation is that you must be positioned below or lower than the object for it to appear to rise.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: When you see something rise, you are where in relation to it?
