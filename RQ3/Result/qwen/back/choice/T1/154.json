Dishes are generally kept in areas that protect them from dust and make them easily accessible for use. Let's consider each option:\n\n- **A. Drawer**: While some kitchens do have drawers specifically designed for utensils or smaller items, they are not the most common place for storing dishes.\n- **B. Shelf**: Shelves can be used for storing dishes, but they might expose the dishes to dust and may not be as secure or protected as other storage solutions.\n- **C. Pantry**: A pantry is more commonly used for storing food items rather than dishes. It's usually a dedicated space for groceries and non-perishable food items.\n- **D.

Drawer**: While drawers can store utensils and small items, they are not ideal for larger dishware like plates and bowls due to space constraints and potential damage from stacking.\n- **B. Shelf**: Shelves can hold dishes but are less preferable because dishes might get dusty and are not as secure compared to enclosed spaces.\n- **C. Pantry**: A pantry is primarily used for food storage and may not have the necessary shelving or space optimized for dishware.\n- **D. Apartment**: An apartment is a living space and not a specific storage area for dishes.\n- **E. Cabinet**: Cabinets are specifically designed for storing dishware. They provide a clean, enclosed space that protects dishes from dust and damage while keeping them organized and easily accessible.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}]
