Babies are born with very limited capabilities and go through various developmental milestones, such as learning to walk and talk, over time. Until they reach these milestones, their inability to perform certain tasks can cause difficulties for caregivers.\n\nLet's analyze the options given:\n\nA. Arrive early - This refers to premature birth, which is a condition that occurs before the baby is fully developed and can indeed pose significant challenges for parents. However, the question seems to imply a general difficulty related to typical infant development rather than a medical complication.\n\nB. Learn to walk - While learning to walk is a milestone, the question asks about something that causes problems before the baby has reached that milestone. So, this option doesn't fit the context of the question.\n\nC. Boy or girl - The gender of the child does not directly impact the daily challenges of raising an infant.\n\nD. Bring joy - Bringing joy is a positive aspect of having a baby and does not cause problems.\n\nE. Talk nonsense - Infants cannot talk at all, let alone make sense, which means communication is severely limited. This limitation can lead to frustration for both the baby and the parents when trying to understand and meet the baby's needs.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Joan was a baby, so there were many things she couldn't do, which caused problems for her parents.

Arrive early: This refers to premature birth, which is a medical condition and while challenging, it is not a typical issue related to the baby's developmental stage.\n- B. Learn to walk: This is a milestone that babies achieve later, so it is not something that causes immediate problems.\n- C. Boy or girl: The gender of the child does not directly affect the daily challenges of raising an infant.\n- D. Bring joy: This is a positive outcome and does not present a challenge.\n- E.
