Here's a breakdown of each option:\n\n- **A. ask questions**: Asking a child to ask questions might be too open-ended and could lead to unpredictable responses, especially if they are young.\n- **B. count to ten**: While counting can be a good activity, it might not be the most natural or polite way to start an interaction.\n- **C. costume**: This option doesn't make sense in the context of meeting someone for the first time unless it's a specific event like Halloween.\n- **D. state name**: Asking a child to state their name is a common and polite way to initiate a conversation.\n- **E. dress herself**: This is a skill that children develop over time and isn't typically something you'd ask about during a first meeting.\n\nConsidering these points, the most appropriate action is to ask the child to state their name.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. state name"}]
