Maps are graphical representations of areas, which can be used for navigation or reference.

The key here is understanding that \"getting\" maps in this context means retrieving them from a storage place, not purchasing or obtaining them.\n\n- Option A (bookstore) and B (library) are places where you can acquire maps but not typically where you would retrieve ones you already own.\n- Option C (electrical circuit) is irrelevant to storing maps.\n- Option D (cabinet) is a logical place where you might store personal items, including maps.\n- Option E (important when traveling) refers to the utility of maps rather than their storage location.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}]
