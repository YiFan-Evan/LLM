These books are designed to engage readers through interactive, three-dimensional illustrations that \"pop up\" when the book is opened or specific pages are turned. The goal is to make the story more visually compelling and immersive.\n\nAmong the given options:\n- A. giggle: This is an action related to laughter, not interacting with the book.\n- B. visualize: This is a mental process, not a physical interaction with the book.\n- C. open book: This is a relevant action but not specific enough to the unique feature of pop-up books.\n- D. reading: This is a necessary part of experiencing the story but doesn't directly relate to the popping-up mechanism.\n- E. go to movies: This is unrelated to interacting with a pop-up book.\n\nThe specific action that activates the pop-up mechanism is opening or turning the pages of the book, which triggers the three-dimensional elements to appear.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. reading (since reading implies interacting with the book by turning pages, which would trigger the pop-up mechanism). \n\nHowever, considering the direct interaction required for the pop-ups to activate, the most accurate answer would be C. open book. But since the question seems to focus on the act of engaging with the content of the book, the best fit from the provided options is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. reading"}]
