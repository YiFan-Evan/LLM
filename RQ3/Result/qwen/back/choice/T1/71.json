Let's break down the key elements:\n\n1. **Human Survival Requirements**: Humans require certain environmental conditions to survive, including breathable air, liquid water, moderate temperatures, and adequate atmospheric pressure.\n2. **Mercury's Conditions**:\n   - **Atmosphere**: Mercury lacks a substantial atmosphere; it has almost no air.\n   - **Temperature**: Temperatures on Mercury vary widely, from extremely hot to extremely cold.\n   - **Water**: There is no liquid water on Mercury.\n   - **Pressure**: The atmospheric pressure is virtually non-existent.\n\nGiven these conditions, we can eliminate options that do not directly address the unsuitability for human life:\n\n- **E. Jupiter**: This is another planet and does not describe Mercury's condition.\n- **D. Poisonous**: While Mercury might have some poisonous substances, this does not fully capture the broad unsuitability for human life.\n- **C. Mercury Sulphide**: This is a specific chemical compound found on Mercury but does not describe its overall unsuitability for human life.\n- **A. Toxic**: Similar to \"poisonous,\" this does not fully encompass the range of unsuitable conditions.\n\nThus, the most appropriate term that describes the overall unsuitability of Mercury for human life is \"uninhabitable.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. uninhabitable"}]
