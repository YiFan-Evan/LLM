Cupboard**: A cupboard is a storage space commonly found in kitchens that is designed to keep items such as food dry and protected from dust and pests.\n- **C. Oven**: An oven is used for cooking food at high temperatures. While it can get very hot and dry inside during operation, it's not a place where food would be stored after being cooked.\n- **D. Stomach**: The stomach is part of the digestive system and contains acids, making it a very wet environment.\n- **E. Fridge**: A refrigerator keeps food cool but does not necessarily keep it dry.
