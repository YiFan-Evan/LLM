Here are the key points to consider:\n\n1. **Panic (A)**: If Zane suffers from panic attacks or severe anxiety, this could hinder his ability to answer questions due to overwhelming nervousness or fear.\n2. **Discussion (B)**: This option does not directly relate to the inability to answer questions. It pertains more to the act of engaging in conversation rather than providing answers.\n3. **Attention (C)**: Issues with attention might affect Zane's ability to focus on questions and formulate responses, but it is not the most fitting description for someone who simply dislikes answering questions.\n4. **Confusion (D)**: If Zane is confused, he may struggle to understand questions or formulate clear answers, which would directly impact his ability to answer questions effectively.\n5. **Satisfaction (E)**: Satisfaction typically implies contentment or happiness, which is not a plausible reason for someone struggling to answer questions.\n\nGiven these explanations, confusion appears to be the most appropriate reason for Zane's difficulty in answering questions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D.
