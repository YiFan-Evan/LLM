Gases like carbon monoxide or chlorine can cause severe health issues leading to death.\n- **Homicide (B)**: This refers to the act of killing another person. While not a substance or environmental factor, it directly results in death.\n- **Cinder (C)**: Cinder is a byproduct of burned material and typically does not directly cause death unless inhaled in large quantities over time, which is less common.\n- **Nuclear weapons (D)**: The detonation of a nuclear weapon causes immediate destruction and widespread radiation poisoning, leading to mass fatalities.\n- **Cyanide (E)**: Cyanide is highly toxic and can be lethal even in small doses. It interferes with the body's ability to use oxygen, leading to rapid death.\n\nConsidering these points, both **poisonous gas** and **cyanide** are highly lethal, but nuclear weapons and homicide have broader impacts. However, among the specific substances listed, cyanide and poisonous gas are notable for their lethality.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **E**.

Cyanide**: Cyanide is extremely toxic and can cause death within minutes if ingested or inhaled in sufficient quantities. It works by blocking the cellular uptake of oxygen, leading to rapid asphyxiation.\n  \n- **D. Nuclear weapons**: While highly destructive and capable of causing mass fatalities through immediate blast effects, thermal radiation, and long-term radiation exposure, this option is more about a catastrophic event rather than a direct cause of individual early deaths.\n\n- **C. Cinder**: Cinder is a residue from burning materials and generally does not pose a significant risk to human life unless inhaled in large quantities over a prolonged period, which is uncommon.\n\n- **B. Homicide**: This refers to the act of killing another person, which directly results in death but is an action rather than a substance or environmental factor.\n\n- **A. Poisonous gas**: Various types of poisonous gases can be lethal if inhaled, depending on the type and concentration. Examples include carbon monoxide, chlorine, and others that can cause severe respiratory distress and death.\n\nAmong these options, cyanide and poisonous gas are both highly lethal substances that can cause rapid death upon exposure. However, cyanide is known for its extreme toxicity and the speed at which it can cause death.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **E. Cyanide**."}]
