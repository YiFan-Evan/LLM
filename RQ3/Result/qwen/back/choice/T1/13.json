Let's break down the possible outcomes:\n\n- **A. Bad dreams**: This is not a direct or common outcome of intimacy.\n- **B. A good night's sleep**: Intimacy can often lead to a sense of relaxation and contentment, which might contribute to a good night's sleep.\n- **C.

Here are the potential implications of the options provided:\n\n- **A. Bad dreams**: While sexual activity can influence dreams, there's no direct causal link to bad dreams specifically because of sex.\n- **B. A good night's sleep**: Sexual activity can promote relaxation and satisfaction, potentially leading to better sleep quality.\n- **C. Rest**: Similar to a good night's sleep, sexual activity can contribute to overall restfulness.\n- **D. Sleepiness**: Sexual activity can be physically demanding and emotionally satisfying, leading to increased drowsiness.\n- **E. Get pregnant**: This is a specific outcome that can occur if the sexual activity results in unprotected intercourse during the woman's fertile period.\n\nSince the question asks for what \"going to bed with your spouse for sex\" leads to, and considering all the options, getting pregnant is a specific outcome that could happen but isn't guaranteed every time.
