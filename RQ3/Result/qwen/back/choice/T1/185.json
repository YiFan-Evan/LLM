The act of killing someone typically triggers various emotional reactions from both the perpetrator and society at large. \n\n- **Vengeance (A)**: This is a likely consequence for the victim's family or loved ones.\n- **Going to prison (B)**: This is a legal consequence rather than an emotion.\n- **Joy (C)**: Generally, causing death does not evoke joy in most individuals.\n- **Afraid (D)**: Fear could be an emotion felt by the perpetrator or those aware of the crime.\n- **Terrible (E)**: This describes a state of feeling very bad, which could be an emotional response.\n\nGiven these considerations, the emotion that killing someone should not cause is joy, as joy is not a typical or appropriate response to such a harmful act.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Killing people should not cause what emotion?\nOptions: E. terrible D. afraid C. joy B. going to prison A. vengeance"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To address this question, we must consider the emotional responses that killing someone might provoke.
