Punctured**: This could be true since a hole means the ball is punctured.\n   - **B.

Therefore, this statement can be true.\n- **B. popular in america**: The popularity of basketball in America is unrelated to the condition of the basketball itself. Thus, this statement can be true or false independently of the condition of the basketball.\n- **C. full of air**: A basketball with a hole would likely lose some air through the hole, so it is unlikely to be fully inflated. Therefore, this statement would not be true.\n- **D. gone**: The basketball is still present even though it has a hole, so it is not \"gone\". Therefore, this statement would not be true.\n- **E. round**: Even with a hole, the basketball can still retain its round shape as long as the hole isn't large enough to significantly alter its shape. Therefore, this statement can be true.\n\nFrom the analysis above, the statement that would not be true about the basketball is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. full of air"}]
