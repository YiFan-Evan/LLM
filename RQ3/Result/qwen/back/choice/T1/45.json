Clerk**: This term refers to a person who works at a counter, often handling sales or services but does not represent a location.\n- **B. Indoors**: While concerts can indeed be held indoors, this option is too vague and doesn't specifically identify a location where tickets are sold and concerts occur.\n- **C. Movie Theater**: This is a place for watching films, not for concerts.\n- **D. Venue**: A venue is a place where events such as concerts are held. It can also have ticket booths for selling entry tickets.\n- **E. Auditorium**: An auditorium is a large room or hall designed for gatherings and performances.

Movie Theater**: This is a place for watching films, not for concerts.\n- **D. Venue**: A venue is a place where events like concerts are held and often has facilities for selling tickets.\n- **E. Auditorium**: An auditorium is a large room or hall designed for gatherings and performances.
