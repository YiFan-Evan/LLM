The sentence suggests that something which appears fragile serves its intended purpose so well that it effectively counters its apparent fragility. Among the options provided, we're looking for a term that means strong or resistant to damage.\n\nLet's break down the options:\n\n- **A. indestructible**: This means impossible to destroy. It's a very strong term.\n- **B. durable**: This means able to withstand wear, pressure, or damage. It\u2019s also a strong term but not as absolute as indestructible.\n- **C. undestroyable**: This is not a standard English word. The correct form would be \"indestructible.\"\n- **D. indestructible**: Same as A.\n- **E. unbreakable**: This means impossible to break. Similar to indestructible but more specific to breaking.\n\nGiven these definitions, both \"indestructible\" and \"unbreakable\" are strong candidates. However, \"indestructible\" is more commonly used in contexts where the object's resistance to various types of damage is emphasized.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Though the thin film seemed fragile, for it's intended purpose it was actually nearly what?\nOptions: E. unbreakable D. indestructible C. undestroyable B. durable A. indestructible"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The sentence suggests that the thin film, despite appearing fragile, performs its intended purpose very effectively. We need to choose a word that indicates strength or resistance to damage or destruction, while also aligning with the nuance that it is nearly, rather than completely, immune to damage.\n\nLet's evaluate the options:\n- **A. indestructible**: This means incapable of being destroyed. It implies absolute resistance to any kind of damage, which is very strong.\n- **B. durable**: This means capable of withstanding wear, pressure, or damage. It suggests resilience but is not as strong as indestructible.\n- **C. undestroyable**: This is not a standard English word; the correct form would be \"indestructible.\"\n- **D. indestructible**: Same as A.\n- **E. unbreakable**: This means impossible to break. It is strong but more specific to breaking rather than general damage.\n\nSince the film is described as \"nearly\" something, \"durable\" fits better because it suggests that the film can withstand normal wear and tear without implying absolute invulnerability. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. durable"}]
