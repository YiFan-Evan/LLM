When someone listens intensely, it typically means they are giving their full attention to the speaker or the content being presented. This behavior is closely related to the act of paying close attention, which ensures better comprehension and retention of the material.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- **A. Gain confidence**: While listening can contribute to confidence, it's not the direct goal when intensely listening to a lecture.\n- **B. Concentrate**: This is a component of intense listening but does not fully capture the goal.\n- **C. Get attention**: The listener is usually receiving attention rather than trying to get it.\n- **D.
