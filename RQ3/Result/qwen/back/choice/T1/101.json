Parties are generally considered opportunities for individuals to interact with others, potentially forming new connections or strengthening existing ones. Options like getting drunk or doing drugs might occur at some parties but they do not represent the primary goal for most attendees. Similarly, while making \"new contacts\" or \"doing drugs\" could be potential outcomes, they don't encapsulate the broad and positive intent behind attending a social event. \"Set home\" does not make sense in the context.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. making new friends"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: If you're going to a party in a new town what are you hoping to make?\nOptions: E. set home D. doing drugs C. new contacts B. making new friends A. getting drunk"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fundamental principle involved here is understanding the social and psychological motivations behind attending a party, especially in a new town where one might not know many people.
