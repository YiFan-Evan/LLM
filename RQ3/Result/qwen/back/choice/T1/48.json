Strikes are typically initiated by workers' unions when there is a significant disagreement between the workers and the management regarding working conditions, wages, benefits, or other terms of employment. For a strike to end, the demands made by the unions generally need to be met by the management. However, for a strike to be considered legitimate and to have a chance of achieving its goals, the demands must be reasonable and justified.\n\nA reasonable demand is one that is fair and justifiable under the circumstances, taking into account industry standards, the financial health of the company, and the needs of the employees. Demands that are too extreme or unreasonable may prolong the strike without leading to a resolution. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What type of demands to the unions need to be making to go off strike?\nOptions: E. union D. return to work C. not go to work B. more money A. reasonable"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To resolve a strike, unions typically need to achieve a resolution that addresses their grievances and leads to an improvement in their working conditions or compensation. The key principle here is that the strike ends when the demands of the union are met to some extent, allowing the workers to return to their jobs under better conditions.\n\n- Option A (reasonable) refers to the nature of the demands but does not directly indicate action.\n- Option B (more money) is a specific type of demand, which could be part of the solution but is not universally applicable or necessarily the primary action needed.\n- Option C (not go to work) is counterproductive and would exacerbate the situation rather than resolve it.\n- Option D (return to work) implies an agreement has been reached and the workers are ready to resume their duties, indicating the end of the strike.\n- Option E (union) is not an action but an entity involved in the process.\n\nThe most direct action that signifies the end of a strike is the workers returning to work under new agreed-upon terms. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nD. return to work"}]
