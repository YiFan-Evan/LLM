The key aspects are:\n\n1. **Location**: The place must be \"far away from your house.\"\n2. **Activity**: You should be able to \"consume beer\" at this location.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option based on these criteria:\n\n- **A. Refrigerator**: This is typically located inside your own house, so it does not meet the criterion of being far away.\n- **B. Friend's house**: This is a plausible option because it can be far away from your house and it\u2019s a common place where people gather to consume beer.\n- **C. Keg**: A keg is an object rather than a location. While you might find a keg at a remote location, the keg itself does not fulfill the requirement of being a place to consume beer.\n- **D. Neighbor's house**: This is usually quite close to your house, so it doesn't satisfy the \"far away\" criterion.\n- **E. Kitchen**: Similar to the refrigerator, this is typically within your own house, so it does not qualify.\n\nGiven the analysis, the best option that satisfies both conditions is:\n\n**B.
