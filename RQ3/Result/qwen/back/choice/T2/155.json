Let's break down each option:\n\nA. Arrive early - While premature birth can indeed pose health risks and necessitate special care, the question implies something that is characteristic of all babies rather than a specific medical condition.\n\nB. Learn to walk - This is actually a developmental milestone that is achieved over time and signifies progress rather than difficulty. Parents generally look forward to this stage.\n\nC. Boy or girl - The gender of the baby does not inherently create difficulties in childcare; it's more about the physical and emotional needs of the child.\n\nD. Bring joy - Joy is a positive outcome from having a baby and doesn't present a challenge.\n\nE. Talk nonsense - Babies cannot speak coherently, which means they can't express their needs or communicate effectively. This inability to convey what they need or how they feel can be quite challenging for caregivers.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Joan was a baby, so there were many things she couldn't do, which caused problems for her parents.

Each option needs to be analyzed based on this criterion:\n\nA. Talk nonsense - Babies cannot speak coherently and thus cannot express their needs or emotions clearly, which can lead to frustration and difficulty in understanding what the baby requires.\n\nB. Bring joy - While bringing joy is a wonderful aspect of having a baby, it is not a challenge but rather a benefit.\n\nC. Boy or girl - The gender of the baby does not inherently create difficulties in childcare; it is more about the physical and emotional needs of the child.\n\nD. Learn to walk - Although learning to walk is a developmental phase that may involve some falls and learning curves, it is typically seen as a positive milestone and not a significant challenge.\n\nE. Arrive early - Premature birth can indeed cause significant health issues and require special care, but the question seems to focus on a universal aspect of infancy rather than a specific medical condition.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most fitting answer is related to the lack of communication skills.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A."}]
