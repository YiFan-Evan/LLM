However, this is not the primary benefit of exercise.\n2. **Weight Loss** (B) and **Losing Weight** (E): These are specific outcomes that can result from regular exercise, especially when combined with proper nutrition. However, they are not the main benefit for everyone who exercises.\n3. **Get in Shape** (C): Getting in shape implies improvements in physical fitness, which can include aspects like increased strength, endurance, and flexibility. While this is a significant outcome, it is still somewhat narrow in scope.\n4. **Healthy** (D): Being healthy encompasses a broad range of positive outcomes, including improved cardiovascular health, stronger muscles and bones, better mental health, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases.
