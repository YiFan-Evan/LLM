People who have a fear of illness typically avoid situations or individuals that could potentially expose them to pathogens or make them feel vulnerable to getting sick. \n\nLet's analyze each option:\n- A doctor's office (Option A): While doctors' offices are places where illnesses are treated and diagnosed, they are also places where healthy individuals go for check-ups and preventive care. Therefore, this is not the most direct trigger for someone fearing illness.\n- Graveyard (Option B): This location is more commonly associated with death rather than illness. \n- Elderly person (Option C): While older individuals might have more health issues due to age, being elderly alone is not a direct indicator of illness.\n- Hospital (Option D): Hospitals are places where many people are treated for various illnesses, making it a plausible trigger for someone fearing illness. However, hospitals are also places of healing.\n- Sick person (Option E): Direct exposure to someone who is sick is the most immediate and clear trigger for someone with a fear of illness.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most direct and logical choice is a sick person, as they are the most likely to pose a risk of illness.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}]
