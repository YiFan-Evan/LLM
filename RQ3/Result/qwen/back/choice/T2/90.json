Water Fountain - This is a place where people might drink directly from, but it is not a storage location for cups.\nC. Sand Box - This is an outdoor play area and not a place where cups would be stored or retrieved for drinking.\nD. Toilet - This is a bathroom fixture for sanitation purposes and not a place where cups are typically stored for drinking.\nE.
