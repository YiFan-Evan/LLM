To solve this, we need to focus on adjectives that describe the visibility or appearance of an uncovered rear.\n\n- Option A \"full\" can describe a body part but doesn't directly relate to being noticeable due to being uncovered.\n- Option B \"ample\" means generous in size or amount, which can be used to describe a well-shaped or sizable posterior that might catch attention.\n- Option C \"covered\" contradicts the scenario since the butt is described as bare.\n- Option D \"bareword\" is not a standard adjective and does not make sense in context.\n- Option E \"ample\" is repeated and carries the same meaning as B.\n\nGiven the context, the best choice that describes why Sam can't stop staring is the quality of the posterior being notably large or well-shaped.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The butt was bare, and Sam couldn't stop staring at it.
