They accumulate penalties and interest over time if not settled.\n2. **Types of Taxes**: Generally, taxes can be categorized into different types based on when they are due or how they are assessed. Common types include income tax, property tax, sales tax, etc. However, the question specifically refers to the timing of the taxes owed.\n\nGiven the context of \"back taxes,\" which are taxes from previous years that were not paid on time, the logical complementary term would refer to taxes that are currently due.\n\nAnalyzing the options:\n- **A. Anterior**: This term means before in time or order, which does not fit well with the concept of taxes.\n- **B. Front**: This term also does not make sense in the context of tax timing.\n- **C. Main**: This term does not relate directly to the timing of taxes.\n- **D. Front**: Same as option B, does not fit the context.\n- **E.

Back taxes refer to taxes that are overdue or unpaid from previous periods. The complementary concept here would be taxes that are due currently or are up-to-date.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\n- **A. current**: This term refers to taxes that are due now or are in the present period.
