Slaughter House**: Slaughterhouses process animals, leading to significant amounts of blood being present on the floor.\n- **C. Blood Bank**: Blood banks store blood for medical use but don't generally have blood spilled on the floor.\n- **D. Vein**: Veins are part of the circulatory system and do not result in blood being spilled on the floor.\n- **E.
