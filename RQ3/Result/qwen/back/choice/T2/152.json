The key elements are:\n\n1. Billy is trying to escape from a dog.\n2. He leaps up somewhere where the dog can't reach him.\n3. Once he leaps up, he gets stuck.\n\nGiven these points, we can deduce that the place Billy leaps to must be elevated and somewhat confined so that once he lands there, he cannot easily jump or climb down. Let's analyze each option:\n\nA. Kennel - This is typically a small enclosed space for dogs. It wouldn\u2019t be a place where Billy could leap to escape a dog; rather, it\u2019s where the dog might be.\n\nB. Table - A table is an elevated surface. If Billy leaps onto a table, the dog would not be able to reach him easily. Additionally, once on the table, Billy might find it difficult to get down if the table is tall enough or if he feels trapped.\n\nC. Porch - While a porch is also an elevated structure, it is usually more open and less likely to trap someone who has jumped onto it.\n\nD. Backyard - This is an open space and doesn\u2019t offer any elevation or confinement.\n\nE. Park - This is also an open space and does not provide the necessary elevation or confinement.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the most logical place where Billy could leap to and get stuck is a table.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Billy saw a dog running from him and did his best to get away from it.
