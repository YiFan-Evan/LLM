Revolving doors are designed to allow people to enter or exit a building in a controlled manner while minimizing the amount of air exchange between the inside and outside environments. This feature makes them particularly useful in locations where maintaining a consistent temperature and security level is important.\n\nSecurity measures are typically more stringent in places that handle large amounts of money or sensitive information.
