Farm land is land that is primarily used for agricultural purposes, such as growing crops or raising livestock. The question asks what farm land makes use of, implying that we need to identify the type of area where farming occurs.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n- A. Illinois: This is a specific state known for its farmland but does not describe the type of land itself.\n- B. Farming areas: This directly describes the type of area where farming occurs.\n- C. North Dakota: This is another specific state known for its agriculture but does not describe the type of land.\n- D. Michigan: This is a specific state and not a general description of farmland.\n- E. Countryside: While this can refer to rural areas where farming occurs, it is not as precise as \"farming areas.\"\n\nConsidering the need for a general description of the type of land used for farming, the best choice is \"farming areas.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
