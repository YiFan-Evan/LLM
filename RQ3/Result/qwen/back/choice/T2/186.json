These include proper nutrition, regular exercise, and adequate rest. Let's break down the options:\n\nA. Eat more - This can be beneficial if it involves eating more nutrient-dense foods, but simply consuming more calories without regard to their quality or balance can hinder fitness goals.\n\nB. Starve - This is counterproductive. Starvation deprives the body of necessary nutrients and can slow metabolism, making it harder to lose weight or build muscle.\n\nC. Give up - This is not a strategy for improvement or achieving fitness goals. It implies surrendering rather than pushing through challenges.\n\nD. Period of recovery - This is essential for muscle repair and growth, preventing overtraining, and maintaining overall health. Adequate rest ensures that the body can recover from the stress of workouts and adapt positively.\n\nE.
