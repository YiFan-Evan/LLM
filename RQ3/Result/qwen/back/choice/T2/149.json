He's not good at it...\". This suggests that there is some underlying issue that makes Zane struggle with answering questions.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Panic - If Zane suffers from panic, it could make him uncomfortable or unable to think clearly when asked a question.\nB. Discussion - This does not fit well because the problem is specifically about answering questions, not engaging in discussions.\nC. Attention - While difficulty paying attention could affect his ability to answer questions, it is not the most direct connection.\nD. Confusion - If Zane is confused, he would indeed have trouble answering questions because he wouldn't understand them properly.\nE. Satisfaction - This does not make sense in the context of answering questions.\n\nConsidering the context and the options, the most fitting reason for Zane's difficulty in answering questions is likely related to his mental state or comprehension, which leads us to choose between panic and confusion.\n\nHowever, \"panic\" implies a more sudden and emotional reaction, whereas \"confusion\" directly affects his understanding and ability to respond.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D.

The core issue here is likely related to his cognitive state or mental condition when faced with questions.\n\n- Option A (satisfaction) doesn't fit because feeling satisfied would not prevent someone from answering questions.\n- Option B (confusion) is plausible because confusion can impair one's ability to understand and formulate answers.\n- Option C (attention) could be a factor but doesn\u2019t directly address the act of answering questions.\n- Option D (discussion) isn't relevant since the problem is specifically about answering questions, not participating in discussions.\n- Option E (panic) might also be a factor, but panic is an intense emotional response, while the issue seems more cognitive than emotional.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most logical choice is confusion, as it directly impacts the ability to answer questions effectively.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. Confusion"}]
