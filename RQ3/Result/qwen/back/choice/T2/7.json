Orphan - An orphan is a child who has lost both parents. The family would not be abhorring an orphan; instead, they are considering adopting one.\nB. Biological child - This option doesn't fit well because the question is about the reason for adopting rather than having a biological child.\nC.

This implies that their decision is guided by ethical considerations that may also have an environmental or societal impact.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\nA. Abandon - This means to leave someone behind, often implying neglect or abandonment. If the family is motivated by ethical reasons, they would likely abhor the act of abandoning children.\nB. Foster child - This does not align with the ethical concern of adoption. Fostering is a different form of childcare and does not necessarily involve the same ethical dilemmas as adoption.\nC. Give away - While this could relate to ethical concerns, it is more about giving up a child rather than directly addressing the ethical reasons for adopting.\nD. Biological child - This option is unrelated to the ethical reasons for adopting and focuses instead on the genetic aspect of having a child.\nE. Orphan - This refers to a child who has lost both parents. While adopting an orphan could be part of the ethical reasoning, the question asks what they abhor, not what they are adopting.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most fitting option is the one that aligns with ethical concerns against abandonment.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. abandon"}]
