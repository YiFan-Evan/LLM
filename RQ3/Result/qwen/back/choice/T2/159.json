People often use their phones to quickly find answers to questions, look up facts, or learn about topics. Given this context, we need to evaluate each option:\n\n- A. Manual: Manuals are typically physical documents or digital documents that come with specific products or devices. They are not generally used for general information-seeking.\n- B. Google: Google is a widely-used search engine that allows users to find information from a vast array of sources across the internet. It is very popular on mobile devices due to its convenience and comprehensive coverage.\n- C. Online: This term is somewhat vague but generally refers to accessing the internet. While this is accurate, it doesn't specify a particular tool or method.\n- D. Book: Physical books are not typically accessed directly through phones, although e-books exist but are less frequently used for quick information searches.\n- E. Internet: Similar to \"online,\" this term is broad and encompasses various sources of information.\n\nGiven the widespread use of Google for searching and finding information quickly, and considering the other options are either too broad or not commonly used for quick searches on phones, the most appropriate answer is Google.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
