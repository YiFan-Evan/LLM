The sentence describes someone who is very outgoing, which means they are sociable and friendly. The sentence suggests that for this person, making friends is not a difficult or unpleasant experience.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. scary - This implies that making friends is not a scary experience for him.\nB. having friends - This does not fit grammatically or logically in the sentence.\nC. good feeling - This would imply that making friends is not a good feeling, which contradicts his outgoing nature.\nD. conflict - This implies that making friends is not a source of conflict for him.\nE. friendship - This does not fit grammatically or logically in the sentence.\n\nGiven the context, the most fitting word would be something that contrasts with his outgoing nature, suggesting that making friends is not a negative or difficult experience for him.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: He was very outgoing, for him making friends was no personal what?\nOptions: A. friendship B. conflict C. good feeling D. having friends E. scary"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The sentence describes someone who is very outgoing, meaning they are sociable and friendly.
