Cleaning house generally involves physical exertion such as sweeping, mopping, dusting, and moving furniture, which can lead to fatigue.

Cleaning a house for an extended period involves physical labor such as sweeping, mopping, scrubbing, and organizing items. This type of activity requires energy expenditure and can lead to several outcomes:\n\n- **Sneezing (A)**: This could occur if the cleaning process stirs up dust and allergens.\n- **Exhaustion (B)**: This refers to a state of extreme tiredness resulting from prolonged physical exertion.\n- **Order (C)**: This pertains to the arrangement of items and cleanliness of the space, not a personal state.\n- **Tiredness (D)**: Similar to exhaustion but typically less severe, indicating a feeling of weariness.\n- **Neatness (E)**: Like order, this describes the state of the house rather than the state of the person cleaning.\n\nGiven that the question asks about what \"could happen\" to the person performing the cleaning over a long period, the most comprehensive and fitting response would involve the physical state of the individual after such exertion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. exhaustion"}]
