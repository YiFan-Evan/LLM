However, the key point in the question is that John stopped when he reached the ocean and couldn't go any further.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Mountain - This is an elevated landform and wouldn't typically be described as a \"plain.\"\nB. Fancy - This term doesn't relate to a geographical feature or terrain.\nC. Sandplain - This is a flat area covered with sand, which could be considered a type of plain.\nD. Cliff - This is a steep rock face, not a flat area.\nE. Gorge - This is a narrow valley with steep sides, not a flat area.\n\nSince John rode on a plain and stopped at the ocean, the most fitting description would be a flat area that can lead to the ocean. Among the options provided, the closest match is \"sandplain,\" but since \"plain\" typically refers to a broad, flat area, and there isn't a perfect fit, we must choose the best available option.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther.
