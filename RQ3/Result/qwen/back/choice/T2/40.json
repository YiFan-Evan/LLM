This means that the performance cannot be pre-recorded or played back like a movie or a recorded concert.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Movie - Movies are pre-recorded visual entertainment shown in theaters. They do not involve live performances.\n\nB. Show - Shows can include various types of live entertainment such as theater plays, dance performances, and comedy acts.\n\nC. Concert venue - While concerts can be live, the term \"concert venue\" refers to the place where the concert occurs, not the event itself.\n\nD. Casino - Casinos offer games of chance and some forms of entertainment, but they are not primarily known for live performances.\n\nE. Theatre - Theaters host live performances such as plays, musicals, and other dramatic presentations.\n\nGiven these considerations, both \"show\" and \"theatre\" are strong candidates for live entertainment.
