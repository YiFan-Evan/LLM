Trust himself - Self-assurance is deeply rooted in trusting one's own instincts, decisions, and capabilities. This trust allows a person to act confidently in various situations.\n\nB. Feel important - Although feeling important can be a consequence of self-assurance, it is not the primary action or behavior associated with being self-assured. It is more about an emotional state rather than an active behavior.\n\nC. Know what time - This option is irrelevant to the concept of self-assurance. Knowing the time is a situational awareness that has no direct connection to confidence.\n\nD. Focused - Being focused can certainly help in achieving self-assurance by helping maintain concentration and clarity. However, focus is more of a tool or a state of mind rather than the primary behavior associated with self-assurance.\n\nE. Acknowledgment - Acknowledgment of others or circumstances can be a part of being self-assured, but it is not the defining action. Self-assurance is more about one's own confidence and actions.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the most fitting behavior for a self-assured person is trusting themselves.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A."}]
