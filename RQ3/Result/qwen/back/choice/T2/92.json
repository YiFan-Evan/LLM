A reception desk is typically found in places where it's important to greet visitors or guests upon their arrival.

A reception desk is generally placed at the front entrance of a place where visitors or guests are expected. It serves as the first point of contact for people entering the premises. \n\n- **Office Park**: An office park consists of multiple office buildings and does not typically have a single reception desk at its entrance.\n- **Lobby**: A lobby is the interior entrance space of a building and often contains a reception desk. However, the question asks about the location relative to the front entrance of a broader structure.\n- **Building**: This is a broad term and while buildings can have reception desks, it does not specify the exact area within the building.\n- **Hostel**: A hostel usually has a reception desk, but it is a specific type of accommodation.\n- **Motel**: Similar to a hostel, a motel has a reception desk but is also a specific type of accommodation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate and general term that includes a reception desk at the front entrance is a \"building,\" as it encompasses various types of structures that may include a reception area.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. building"}]
