Stop worrying**: While reducing worry can help someone relax, actively deciding to stop worrying is not an action but rather a state of mind. It is difficult to force oneself to stop worrying, and it doesn't necessarily lead to immediate relaxation.\n  \n- **B. Go to bed**: Going to bed is a routine activity that can be part of relaxation, but it is more about preparing for sleep rather than an active method of relaxation itself.\n\n- **C. Listen to music**: Listening to music is a well-known and effective method to relax. Music can calm the mind and create a soothing environment, making it easier to unwind after a long day.\n\n- **D. Check mail**: Checking mail is typically associated with tasks and responsibilities, which can increase stress rather than reduce it. This is not a good method for relaxation.\n\n- **E. Find time**: Finding time is a preparatory step and not an actual relaxation activity. It involves managing schedules but does not directly contribute to relaxation.\n\nGiven these considerations, the best option for immediate relaxation is listening to music.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C."}]
