Poisonous gas - Inhalation of poisonous gas can cause immediate or delayed death depending on the type and concentration of the gas.\nB. Homicide - Being a victim of homicide, which is the act of one person killing another, leads to an unnatural and premature death.\nC. Cinder - While cinders themselves are not typically lethal, inhaling hot cinders or being exposed to them in large quantities could cause severe injuries or complications that might lead to death.\nD. Nuclear weapons - The use of nuclear weapons can result in massive destruction, immediate deaths due to blast effects, radiation sickness, and long-term environmental damage leading to many more deaths.\nE. Cyanide - Cyanide is a highly toxic substance that can cause rapid death if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin in sufficient quantities.\n\nEach of these factors represents a significant threat to human life and can lead to an early death under the right (or wrong) circumstances."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: WHat leads to an early death?\nOptions: A. cyanide B. nuclear weapons C. cinder D. homicide E. poisonous gas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A."}]
