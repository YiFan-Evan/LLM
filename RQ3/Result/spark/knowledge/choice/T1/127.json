While humans can fly using airplanes or other vehicles, they cannot fly under their own power as birds do. Machines designed for flight can operate autonomously or with minimal human intervention, performing tasks such as aerial surveillance, transportation, and exploration that are beyond human physical capabilities."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What can machines do that humans cannot?\nOptions: E. fly D. see work C. answering questions B. perform work A. fail to work"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "B. perform work\n\nMachines can perform repetitive, strenuous, or highly precise tasks more efficiently and consistently than humans. They can operate 24/7 without fatigue, handle extreme environments, and execute complex calculations at lightning speed. While humans can also perform work, machines can do so with a level of precision, speed, and endurance that far exceeds human capabilities."}]
