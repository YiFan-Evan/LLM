Here's a corrected version of the selection sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        min_index = i\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted portion\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: The outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, where `n` is the length of the array. This loop iterates over each element in the array.\n2. **Finding the Minimum**: For each position `i`, we assume that the element at `i` is the minimum (`min_index = i`). We then use an inner loop to find the actual minimum element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array (from `i+1` to `n-1`).\n3. **Swapping**: Once the minimum element in the unsorted portion is found, we swap it with the element at position `i`.\n4. **Return**: After all iterations are complete, the array is sorted, and we return it.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\narr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\nsorted_arr = selection_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted correctly using the selection sort algorithm."}]
