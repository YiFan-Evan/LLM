This loop selects each element in turn as the starting point for finding the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array.\n2. **Finding the Minimum**: The inner loop starts from `i+1` (the next element after the current one) and goes up to `n-1`. It compares each element to the current minimum and updates the `min_index` if a smaller element is found.\n3. **Swapping**: After finding the minimum element in the unsorted portion, it swaps this element with the first element of the unsorted portion (`arr[i]`).\n4. **Return**: Finally, the sorted array is returned.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\narr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\nsorted_arr = selection_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm."}]
