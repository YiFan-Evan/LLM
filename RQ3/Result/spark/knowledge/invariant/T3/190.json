The variable `i` represents the current position where we want to place the smallest element found in the remaining unsorted portion of the array.\n2. **Assume the Minimum (`min_index = i`):** We initially assume that the element at index `i` is the smallest.\n3. **Inner Loop (`for j in range(i + 1, n)`):** This loop goes through the unsorted portion of the array (from `i+1` to `n-1`) to find the actual smallest element.\n4. **Finding the Minimum (`if arr[j] < arr[min_index]`):** If an element smaller than the current minimum is found, update `min_index`.\n5. **Swapping Elements (`arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]`):** After finding the smallest element in the unsorted portion, swap it with the element at index `i`.\n\nThis corrected version ensures that the array is sorted correctly by repeatedly placing the smallest unsorted element into its correct position."}]
