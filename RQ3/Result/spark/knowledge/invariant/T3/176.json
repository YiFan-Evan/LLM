Specifically, the variable `i` is not defined within the scope of the loop, and the inner loop should start from `q` instead of `i`.

The variable `i` represents the current index of the element being inserted into its correct position.\n\n2. **Key Assignment (`key = arr[i]`):** The `key` variable holds the value of the current element that needs to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array.\n\n3. **Inner Loop (`while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]`):** This loop shifts elements of the sorted portion of the array to the right until it finds the correct position for the `key`. The variable `j` is used to traverse the sorted portion of the array.\n\n4. **Shifting Elements (`arr[j + 1] = arr[j]`):** If the current element `arr[j]` is greater than the `key`, it is shifted one position to the right.\n\n5. **Insertion (`arr[j + 1] = key`):** Once the correct position is found, the `key` is inserted into the array at `arr[j + 1]`.\n\n6. **Return Statement (`return arr`):** Finally, the sorted array is returned.\n\nThis corrected version ensures that each element is compared and placed correctly within the sorted portion of the array, resulting in a sorted array by the end of the function."}]
