For example:\n\n#### Using Python's `min` Function\n```python\ndef find_min(arr):\n    return min(arr)\n```\n\n#### Using a Simpler Loop\n```python\ndef find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    for num in arr:\n        if num < min_value:\n            min_value = num\n    return min_value\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives are more readable and efficient for finding the minimum value in a list."}]
