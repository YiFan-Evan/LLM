The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If an element is greater than the `key`, it shifts that element one position to the right.\n4. **Insertion**: Once the correct position for the `key` is found, it is inserted into the array.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order by repeatedly placing each element in its correct position relative to the already sorted portion of the array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = len(arr)\n    while e > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        e -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code for the insertion sort algorithm contains a few errors and inefficiencies.
