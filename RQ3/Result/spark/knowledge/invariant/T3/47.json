This variable will keep track of the number of times `target` appears in `arr`.\n   - `h` is initialized to 0. This variable serves as the index for iterating through the array.\n\n2. **Loop**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `h` is less than the length of `arr`.\n   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[h]` is equal to `target`.\n   - If they are equal, it increments `count_value` by 1.\n   - After checking the current element, it increments `h` by 1 to move to the next element in the array.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - Once the loop completes (i.e., when `h` reaches the length of `arr`), the function returns `count_value`, which now holds the total count of `target` in `arr`.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr):\n        if arr[h] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        h += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```python\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5]\ntarget = 2\nprint(give_count(arr, target))  # Output: 3\n```\n\nIn this example, the function will return `3` because the number `2` appears three times in the array `arr`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    h = len(arr)\n    while h > 0:\n        h -= 1\n        if arr[h] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n    return count_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The function `give_count` you provided is designed to count the occurrences of a specific target value in an array.
