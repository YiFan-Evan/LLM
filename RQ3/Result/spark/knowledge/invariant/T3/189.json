The goal is to place the smallest unsorted element into its correct position at each iteration.\n2. **Assume the Minimum (`min_index = i`):** At the beginning of each iteration, assume the current element is the smallest.\n3. **Inner Loop (`for j in range(i + 1, n)`):** This loop checks all subsequent elements to find the actual smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array.\n4. **Update Minimum Index (`if arr[j] < arr[min_index]`):** If a smaller element is found, update `min_index` to the index of this new smallest element.\n5. **Swap Elements (`arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]`):** After finding the smallest element in the unsorted portion, swap it with the element at the current position `i`.\n\nThis corrected implementation ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order by repeatedly placing the smallest unsorted element at the beginning of the unsorted portion of the array."}]
