Specifically, the variable `i` is not defined, and the initial value of `j` should be set to 1 instead of -1 to start from the second element in the array. Here's the corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    # Start from the second element (index 1)\n    for j in range(1, len(arr)):\n        z = j\n        # Move elements of arr[0..j-1], that are greater than arr[j],\n        # to one position ahead of their current position\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis function sorts an array in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm. Here's how it works:\n\n1. The outer loop starts from the second element (index 1) and goes through each element of the array.\n2. For each element at index `j`, the inner loop compares it with the elements before it (from index `j-1` down to index 0).\n3. If an element is found that is greater than the current element (`arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`), they are swapped.\n4. This process continues until the current element is placed in its correct position relative to the sorted portion of the array.\n5. The array is returned once all elements have been processed."}]
