Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the insertion sort works:\n\n1. The outer loop (`while i < len(arr)`) iterates over each element in the array starting from the second element (index 1).\n2. For each element, the inner loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`) checks if the current element (`arr[z]`) is smaller than the previous element (`arr[z - 1]`).\n3. If the current element is smaller, it swaps the two elements and continues to compare with the previous elements until it finds its correct position in the sorted portion of the array.\n4. This process repeats for each element in the array until the entire array is sorted.\n\nLet's break down the code with comments to make it clearer:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 1  # Start from the second element since the first element is trivially sorted\n    while i < len(arr):\n        z = i\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key, to one position ahead of their current position\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            # Swap arr[z] and arr[z - 1]\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Example Walkthrough\nConsider the array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`.\n\n1. **Initial State**: `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`\n2. **First Pass (i = 1)**:\n   - Compare `2` with `5`. Since `2 < 5`, swap them.\n   - Array becomes `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`.\n3. **Second Pass (i = 2)**:\n   - Compare `9` with `5`. No swap needed.\n   - Array remains `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`.\n4. **Third Pass (i = 3)**:\n   - Compare `1` with `9`. Since `1 < 9`, swap them.\n   - Compare `1` with `5`. Since `1 < 5`, swap them.\n   - Compare `1` with `2`. Since `1 < 2`, swap them.\n   - Array becomes `[1, 2, 5, 9, 5, 6]`.\n5. **Fourth Pass (i = 4)**:\n   - Compare `5` with `9`. No swap needed.\n   - Array remains `[1, 2, 5, 9, 5, 6]`.\n6. **Fifth Pass (i = 5)**:\n   - Compare `6` with `5`. Since `6 > 5`, no swap needed.\n   - Array remains `[1, 2, 5, 9, 5, 6]`.\n\nFinally, the array is sorted: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`.\n\n### Time Complexity\n- **Best Case**: O(n) when the array is already sorted.\n- **Average and Worst Case**: O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This occurs because each element might need to be compared with many others before it is placed in its correct position."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        i += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code is an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. Insertion sort works by iterating through the array and inserting each element into its correct position relative to the already sorted portion of the array.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The variable `i` is initialized to -1. This will be used to keep track of the current index being processed in the array.\n2. **Outer Loop**: The outer `while` loop runs as long as `i` is less than the length of the array minus one (`len(arr) - 1`). This ensures that all elements are processed.\n3. **Increment Index**: Inside the outer loop, `i` is incremented by 1 at the beginning of each iteration.\n4. **Inner Loop**: The inner `while` loop checks if the current element (`arr[z]`) is smaller than the previous element (`arr[z - 1]`). If so, it swaps them.\n5. **Swapping**: The elements are swapped using a temporary variable `temp`.\n6. **Decrement Index**: After swapping, `z` is decremented by 1 to continue comparing and swapping with the previous elements until the correct position for the current element is found.\n7. **Return**: Once the entire array is processed, the sorted array is returned.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        i += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case (when the array is sorted in reverse order), but O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).\n- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since it sorts the array in place without requiring additional storage.\n- **Stability**: The algorithm is stable; equal elements retain their relative order."}]
