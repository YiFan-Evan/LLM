If a smaller element is found, update `min_index`.\n3. **Swapping**: After finding the minimum element in the subarray, swap it with the element at position `i`.\n4. **Increment**: Move to the next position (`i += 1`) and repeat until the entire array is sorted.\n\nThis corrected version ensures that the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array is moved to its correct position in each iteration, thus sorting the array in ascending order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        i += 1\n        z = i + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code is an attempt to implement the selection sort algorithm, but it contains a logical error.
