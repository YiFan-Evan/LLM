Let's break down how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `sum_value` is initialized to 0. This variable will hold the cumulative sum of the elements in the array.\n   - `p` is initialized to -1. This variable serves as the index for iterating through the array.\n\n2. **Loop**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `p` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. This condition ensures that `p` will eventually reach the last valid index of the array (i.e., `len(arr) - 1`).\n   - Inside the loop, `p` is incremented by 1 (`p += 1`), moving to the next element in the array.\n   - The element at the current index `p` (i.e., `arr[p]`) is added to `sum_value`.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - Once the loop completes (i.e., when `p` equals `len(arr) - 1`), the function returns `sum_value`, which now contains the total sum of all elements in the array.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = -1\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        p += 1\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example array\nexample_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Calling the function with the example array\nresult = give_sum(example_array)\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(result)  # Output: 15\n```\n\nIn this example, the function calculates the sum of the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is `15`, and returns that value.\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nAlthough your approach works correctly, it can be simplified using a more conventional `for` loop or Python's built-in `sum` function:\n\n#### Using a `for` loop:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        sum_value += num\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n#### Using Python's built-in `sum` function:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    return sum(arr)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives are more idiomatic and easier to read."}]
