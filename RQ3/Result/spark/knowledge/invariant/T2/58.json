Let's break down how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `count_value` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of times the target value appears in the array.\n   - `s` is initialized to -1. This variable serves as the index for iterating through the array.\n\n2. **Loop**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `s` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. This ensures that `s` will eventually reach the last valid index of the array.\n   - Inside the loop, `s` is incremented by 1 (`s += 1`).\n   - The current element `arr[s]` is compared to the target value. If they are equal, `count_value` is incremented by 1.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - Once the loop completes, the function returns `count_value`, which now holds the total count of the target value in the array.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    s = -1\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\n        s += 1\n        if arr[s] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```python\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5]\ntarget = 2\nprint(give_count(arr, target))  # Output: 3\n```\n\nIn this example, the function will return `3` because the number `2` appears three times in the array `arr`.\n\n### Alternative Approach:\n\nYou can achieve the same functionality using a more Pythonic approach with a `for` loop:\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    for element in arr:\n        if element == target:\n            count_value += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\nThis version uses a `for` loop to iterate over each element in the array directly, making the code simpler and easier to read. Both versions will produce the same result."}]
