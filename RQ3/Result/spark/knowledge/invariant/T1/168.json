Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the insertion sort works:\n\n1. The outer loop (`while i < len(arr)`) iterates over each element in the array starting from the second element (index 1).\n2. For each element, the inner loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`) compares the current element with its predecessor. If the current element is smaller, they are swapped.\n3. This process continues until the current element is no longer smaller than its predecessor, meaning it has been placed in its correct position relative to all previously sorted elements.\n4. The outer loop then moves to the next element and repeats the process until the entire array is sorted.\n\nLet's break down the code with comments for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            # Swap the elements if the current element is smaller than the previous one\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Example Walkthrough\nConsider the array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`. Here's how the algorithm sorts it:\n\n1. Start with `i = 0`, which means we consider the first element `[5]` as already sorted.\n2. Increment `i` to `1`. Now we have `[5, 2]`. Since `2 < 5`, we swap them to get `[2, 5]`.\n3. Increment `i` to `2`. Now we have `[2, 5, 9]`. No swap needed since `9 > 5`.\n4. Increment `i` to `3`. Now we have `[2, 5, 9, 1]`. We need to move `1` to the front:\n   - Swap `1` and `9` -> `[2, 5, 1, 9]`\n   - Swap `1` and `5` -> `[2, 1, 5, 9]`\n   - Swap `1` and `2` -> `[1, 2, 5, 9]`\n5. Increment `i` to `4`. Now we have `[1, 2, 5, 9, 5]`. Move the second `5` to its correct position:\n   - Swap `5` and `9` -> `[1, 2, 5, 5, 9]`\n6. Increment `i` to `5`. Now we have `[1, 2, 5, 5, 9, 6]`. Move the second `5` to its correct position:\n   - Swap `5` and `9` -> `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n   - Swap `5` and `6` -> `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n\nFinally, the array is sorted: `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`.\n\n### Loop Invariant\nFor the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[:i+1]` is sorted. This means that all elements before index `i` are in their final positions relative to each other.\n\nIn summary, the insertion sort algorithm repeatedly places each element in its correct position within the sorted portion of the array by comparing and swapping elements until the entire array is sorted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your implementation of the insertion sort algorithm is correct. The function `insertion_sort` sorts an array in ascending order using the insertion sort technique.

If the current element is smaller than the previous element, swap them. Continue this process until the current element is in its correct position relative to the sorted portion.\n4. **Return**: After all elements have been processed, return the sorted array.\n\nHere's your code with some comments for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:  # Outer loop to iterate over each element in the array\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:  # Inner loop to place the current element in its correct position\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\nThis will correctly sort the input array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]` into `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`."}]
