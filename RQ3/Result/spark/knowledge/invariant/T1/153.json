[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

For instance, using a `for` loop or the built-in `sum` function:\n\n#### Using a `for` loop:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        sum_value += num\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n#### Using the built-in `sum` function:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    return sum(arr)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives are more concise and leverage Python's built-in functionalities for better readability and performance."}]
