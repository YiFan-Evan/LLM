The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This variable serves as the index for iterating through the array.\n\n2. **While Loop**:\n   - The loop runs as long as `a` is less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`.

For instance, using a `for` loop or the built-in `sum()` function:\n\n#### Using a `for` loop:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        sum_value += num\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n#### Using the built-in `sum()` function:\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    return sum(arr)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives are more concise and idiomatic in Python."}]
