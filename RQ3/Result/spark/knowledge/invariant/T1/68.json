If `target` is not found, it returns -1.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. Initialize `id_value` to -1. This will be used to store the index of the last occurrence of `target`.\n2. Initialize `i` to 0. This will be used as the loop counter.\n3. Use a `while` loop to iterate through the array `arr`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`.\n4. Inside the loop, check if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to `target`.\n   - If it is, update `id_value` to the current index `i`.\n5.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `id_value` is initialized to `-1`, which will be used to store the index of the last occurrence of the target value. If the target value is not found, this value will remain `-1`.\n   - `i` is initialized to `0`, which will be used as the loop counter.\n\n2. **Loop through the array**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `i` is less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`. This ensures that all elements of the array are checked.\n   - Inside the loop, there is a conditional statement that checks if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the target value.\n     - If it is, `id_value` is updated to the current index `i`. This means that `id_value` will eventually hold the index of the last occurrence of the target value.\n   - The counter `i` is incremented by 1 after each iteration to move to the next element in the array.\n\n3. **Return the result**:\n   - After the loop finishes, the function returns `id_value`. If the target value was found in the array, `id_value` will be the index of its last occurrence. Otherwise, it will be `-1`.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            id_value = i\n        i += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\narr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5]\ntarget = 2\nprint(give_id(arr, target))  # Output: 4\n```\n\nIn this example, the function returns `4` because the last occurrence of `2` in the array is at index `4`."}]
