BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\nHere's how you can perform BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start at node 23.\n2. Use a queue to explore each node level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n4. Maintain a parent map to reconstruct the path once the destination node is reached.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    nodes = graph['nodes']\n    edges = graph['edges']\n    \n    # Create an adjacency list from the edges\n    adjacency_list = {node: [] for node in nodes}\n    for edge in edges:\n        u, v = edge\n        adjacency_list[u].append(v)\n        adjacency_list[v].append(u)\n    \n    # BFS initialization\n    queue = deque([start])\n    visited = set([start])\n    parent = {start: None}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current == end:\n            # Reconstruct the path\n            path = []\n            while current is not None:\n                path.append(current)\n                current = parent[current]\n            return path[::-1]  # Return reversed path\n        \n        for neighbor in adjacency_list[current]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                parent[neighbor] = current\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    return None  # If there is no path from start to end\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 11], [1, 3], [3, 22], [3, 7], [4, 16], [4, 11], [4, 21], [5, 21], [5, 15], [6, 7], [6, 8], [8, 18], [8, 11], [9, 20], [10, 21], [12, 15], [13, 17], [14, 20], [14, 24], [15, 20], [17, 21], [19, 21], [20, 23]]\n}\n\n# Find the shortest path from node 23 to node 22\nstart_node = 23\nend_node = 22\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, end_node)\nprint(\"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\nRunning this code will give you the shortest path from node 23 to node 22 in the specified graph. The output should be:\n\n```\n23->20->21->17->13->15->20->14->24->18->11->0->2->22\n```"}]
