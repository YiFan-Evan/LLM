Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - A queue to keep track of nodes to explore next.\n   - A dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parent nodes for path reconstruction.\n\n2. **Start BFS**:\n   - Enqueue the start node (8) with its parent set to None.\n   - Mark node 8 as visited.\n\n3. **Process the queue**:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node that hasn't been visited yet:\n     - Mark it as visited.\n     - Record its parent.\n     - Enqueue it with its parent information.\n     - If the neighbor is the destination node (20), stop and reconstruct the path.\n\n4. **Reconstruct the path**:\n   - Start from the destination node (20).\n   - Follow the parent pointers back to the start node (8).\n\nHere's the implementation of this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node and its parent (None)\n    queue = deque([(start, None)])\n    # Dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parents\n    visited = {start: None}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, parent = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the end node\n        if current_node == end:\n            # Reconstruct the path from end to start using the parent dictionary\n            path = []\n            while current_node is not None:\n                path.append(current_node)\n                current_node = visited[current_node]\n            return path[::-1]  # Return the reversed path\n        \n        # Get all neighbors of the current node\n        neighbors = [edge[1] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[0] == current_node] + \\\n                    [edge[0] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[1] == current_node]\n        \n        for neighbor in neighbors:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                # Mark the neighbor as visited and record its parent\n                visited[neighbor] = current_node\n                queue.append((neighbor, current_node))\n    \n    # If there is no path from start to end\n    return None\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 14], [0, 16], [1, 8], [2, 23], [2, 20], [3, 14], [4, 23], [5, 24], [6, 8], [6, 21], [7, 19], [9, 15], [10, 11], [11, 21], [12, 21], [13, 19], [14, 15], [15, 21], [16, 18], [16, 24], [17, 19], [19, 22], [19, 20], [19, 21]]\n}\n\n# Find the shortest path from node 8 to node 20\nstart_node = 8\nend_node = 20\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, end_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path from node {} to node {}: {}\".format(start_node, end_node, shortest_path))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the shortest path from node 8 to node 20 using BFS.
