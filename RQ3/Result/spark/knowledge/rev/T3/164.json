For each node dequeued, its neighbors are checked. If a neighbor has not been visited, it is marked as visited, its parent is recorded, and it is enqueued.\n- **Path Reconstruction**: Once the goal node is reached, the path is reconstructed by tracing back from the goal node to the start node using the parent records stored in the `visited` dictionary.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the shortest path from node 2 to node 20 in the specified format."}]
