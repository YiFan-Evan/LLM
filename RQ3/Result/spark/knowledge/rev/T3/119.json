The start node is marked as visited with a predecessor of `None`.\n\n2. **Start BFS**:\n   - We enter a loop that continues until the queue is empty.\n   - In each iteration, we dequeue a node and its path from the queue.\n\n3. **Explore Nodes**:\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node (checked by iterating over the edges), we determine the neighboring node.\n   - If this neighbor hasn't been visited yet, we mark it as visited and record its predecessor.\n   - We then enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path.\n   - If the neighbor is the destination node, we return the path.\n\n4. **Construct Path**:\n   - Once the destination node is reached, we reconstruct the path by backtracking from the destination node using the predecessors recorded in the `visited` dictionary.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the shortest path from node 5 to node 3 in the specified format."}]
