The queue stores tuples of the current node and the path taken to reach that node.\n   - A dictionary `visited` keeps track of visited nodes and their predecessors to reconstruct the path later.\n\n2. **Start BFS**:\n   - Enqueue the start node (4) with an initial path containing only the start node.\n   - Mark the start node as visited by adding it to the `visited` dictionary with a value of `None`.\n\n3. **Explore Nodes**:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - For each edge in the graph, check if the current node is part of the edge. If so, determine the neighboring node.\n   - If the neighboring node hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited, record its predecessor, and enqueue it with the updated path.\n   - If the neighboring node is the destination node (7), reconstruct the path using the `visited` dictionary and return it.\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the shortest path from node 4 to node 7 in the specified format."}]
