Let's break down the key parts of the code:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a queue with the start node, a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node, and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n2. **BFS Loop**: We use a loop to process each node in the queue. For each node, we check its neighbors and update the shortest path accordingly.\n3. **Path Construction**: When we reach the destination node, we construct and return the path by joining the nodes in the shortest path list.\n4. **Edge Handling**: We handle edges by checking if the current node is part of an edge and then determining the next node to visit.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible paths level by level, guaranteeing that we find the shortest path when one exists."}]
