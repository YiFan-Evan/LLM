Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Indefinite Integral\nWe start by integrating each term separately.\n\n#### Integration of $ \\sin(\\cos(x)) $\nAs previously mentioned, the integral of $ \\sin(\\cos(x)) $ does not have an elementary antiderivative. However, we can express it in terms of a special function or leave it as an integral.\n\n#### Integration of $ x $\nThe integral of $ x $ is straightforward:\n$$ \\int x \\, dx = \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C_1 $$\n\nCombining these, the indefinite integral of $ \\sin(\\cos(x)) + x $ is:\n$$ \\int (\\sin(\\cos(x)) + x) \\, dx = \\int \\sin(\\cos(x)) \\, dx + \\int x \\, dx $$\n$$ = \\text{Special Function} + \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C $$\n\n### Step 2: Substitute $ x = 4 $\nNow, substitute $ x = 4 $ into the expression:\n$$ \\left[ \\text{Special Function} + \\frac{1}{2} x^2 + C \\right]_{x=4} $$\n$$ = \\left[ \\text{Special Function}(4) + \\frac{1}{2} (4)^2 + C \\right] $$\n$$ = \\text{Special Function}(4) + 8 + C $$\n\n### Step 3: Round Down to the Nearest Integer\nSince the \"Special Function\" part does not simplify to an elementary function, we cannot evaluate it exactly. However, for the purpose of rounding down, we consider the integer part of the expression:\n$$ \\text{Integer Part}(\\text{Special Function}(4) + 8 + C) $$\n\nAssuming the \"Special Function\" contributes a non-negative value (as sine is non-negative in the range of cosine), the smallest integer value would be influenced by the constant $ C $. Without specific values for the constant and the special function at $ x = 4 $, we cannot provide a precise integer. However, if we assume $ C = 0 $ and the special function contribution is also zero (which is a simplification), then:\n$$ \\text{Integer Part}(8) = 8 $$\n\nThus, the final result, rounded down to the nearest integer, is:\n$$ \\boxed{8} $$"}]
