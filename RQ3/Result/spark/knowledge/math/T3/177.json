Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Find the Indefinite Integral\n\nWe start by finding the indefinite integral of each term separately.\n\n#### Integral of $ \\frac{x^2}{\\ln(x)} $\nAs discussed previously, this integral is complex and does not have a simple elementary form. We will use the same approach as before, using integration by parts and special functions where necessary.\n\n#### Integral of $ x $\nThe integral of $ x $ is straightforward:\n$$ \\int x \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C $$\n\nCombining these, the indefinite integral of $ f(x) = \\frac{x^2}{\\ln(x)} + x $ is:\n$$ I(x) = \\int \\frac{x^2}{\\ln(x)} \\, dx + \\int x \\, dx = \\text{[complex expression involving } \\operatorname{li}(x) \\text{]} + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C $$\n\n### Step 2: Evaluate at $ x = 4 $\n\nSince the first part involving $ \\frac{x^2}{\\ln(x)} $ does not have a simple closed form, we will approximate its value at $ x = 4 $ using numerical methods. Let's denote this part as $ A(4) $.\n\nFor the second part, $ \\frac{x^2}{2} $, we evaluate directly:\n$$ \\frac{4^2}{2} = \\frac{16}{2} = 8 $$\n\nThus, the total integral evaluated at $ x = 4 $ is approximately:\n$$ I(4) \\approx A(4) + 8 $$\n\n### Step 3: Round Down to the Nearest Integer\n\nAssuming $ A(4) $ is approximately 22.2877 (from previous calculation), the total is:\n$$ I(4) \\approx 22.2877 + 8 = 30.2877 $$\n\nRounding down to the nearest integer:\n$$ \\lfloor I(4) \\rfloor = 30 $$\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe final result, rounded down to the nearest integer, is:\n$$ \\boxed{30} $$"}]
