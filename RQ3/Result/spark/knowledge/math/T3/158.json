Finally, we will round down the result to get a single integer value.\n\n### Step 1: Find the Indefinite Integral\n\nWe start by finding the indefinite integral of $ \\sin(e^x) + x $. We can split this into two parts and integrate each separately.\n\n#### Part 1: Integrate $ \\sin(e^x) $\nUsing the substitution method, let $ u = e^x $. Then, $ du = e^x \\, dx $ or $ dx = \\frac{du}{e^x} = \\frac{du}{u} $. Substituting these into the integral, we get:\n$$\n\\int \\sin(e^x) \\, dx = \\int \\sin(u) \\frac{du}{u}\n$$\nThis integral does not have a simple elementary antiderivative in terms of standard functions. However, it is expressed in terms of the Sine Integral function, $ \\text{Si}(u) $, where:\n$$\n\\int \\sin(e^x) \\, dx = \\text{Si}(e^x) + C_1\n$$\nwhere $ C_1 $ is the constant of integration.\n\n#### Part 2: Integrate $ x $\nThe integral of $ x $ is straightforward:\n$$\n\\int x \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C_2\n$$\nwhere $ C_2 $ is another constant of integration.\n\n### Step 2: Combine the Results\nCombining the results from both parts, we get:\n$$\n\\int (\\sin(e^x) + x) \\, dx = \\text{Si}(e^x) + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\n$$\nwhere $ C = C_1 + C_2 $ is the overall constant of integration.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate at $ x = 4 $\nNow, substitute $ x = 4 $ into the expression:\n$$\n\\left. \\int (\\sin(e^x) + x) \\, dx \\right|_{x=4} = \\text{Si}(e^4) + \\frac{4^2}{2} + C\n$$\n$$\n= \\text{Si}(e^4) + 8 + C\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Round Down to the Nearest Integer\nSince $ \\text{Si}(e^4) $ is a transcendental number and its exact value is not specified, we cannot calculate its precise value. However, for the purpose of rounding down, we consider that $ \\text{Si}(e^4) $ is a positive number less than $ \\pi $ (as $ e^4 $ is approximately 54.59, and the Sine Integral function grows but remains bounded). Thus, adding $ \\text{Si}(e^4) $ to 8 will not change the integer part of the sum significantly. Therefore, rounding down the result:\n$$\n\\left\\lfloor \\text{Si}(e^4) + 8 + C \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 8 + C \\right\\rfloor\n$$\nSince $ C $ is a constant, it does not affect the integer part when added to 8. Therefore, the final rounded down integer result is:\n$$\n\\boxed{8}\n$$"}]
