However, we can express it as an indefinite integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\frac{\\sin(x)}{xe^x} \\, dx = F(x) + C_2\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(F(x)\\) represents the antiderivative of \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{xe^x}\\), and \\(C_2\\) is the constant of integration for this part.\n\nCombining both parts, the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\int \\left(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{xe^x} + x\\right) \\, dx = F(x) + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(C = C_1 + C_2\\) is the overall constant of integration.\n\nNow, substituting \\(x = 4\\) into the result of the indefinite integral, we get:\n\n\\[\nF(4) + \\frac{4^2}{2} + C\n\\]\n\nSince we are only interested in the integer part of the expression when rounded down, we can ignore the constant \\(C\\) and focus on the evaluable part:\n\n\\[\nF(4) + \\frac{16}{2} = F(4) + 8\n\\]\n\nAssuming \\(F(4)\\) is some real number, the final expression when rounded down to the nearest integer will depend on the value of \\(F(4)\\). However, since we do not have a specific value for \\(F(4)\\), we cannot provide a precise integer result without additional information or numerical evaluation of \\(F(4)\\).\n\nIf we assume that \\(F(4)\\) is a non-negative real number less than 1 (which is a common assumption when dealing with rounding down), then the integer part of the expression would be:\n\n\\[\n\\left\\lfloor F(4) + 8 \\right\\rfloor = 8\n\\]\n\nTherefore, under the assumption that \\(F(4)\\) does not contribute to the integer part when rounded down, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]"}]
