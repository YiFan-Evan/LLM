To find the indefinite integral, we use substitution. Let:\n\\[ u = e^x \\]\nThen, the differential \\( du \\) is:\n\\[ du = e^x dx \\]\nor equivalently:\n\\[ dx = \\frac{du}{e^x} = \\frac{du}{u} \\]\n\nNow, rewrite the integral in terms of \\( u \\):\n\\[ \\int e^{e^x} dx = \\int e^u \\cdot \\frac{du}{u} \\]\n\nThis integral does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions.

For practical purposes, we can say that the value of the integral at \\( x = 4 \\) is significantly larger than any typical numerical value we might consider.\n\nThus, when we round down this very large number to the nearest integer, the result will still be a very large integer.
