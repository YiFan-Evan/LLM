However, for the sake of solving the problem, let's assume we can express it in terms of known special functions or numerical methods if necessary. For practical purposes, we will use numerical integration techniques to approximate the value.\n\nUsing numerical integration (such as Simpson's rule or numerical software), we can approximate the definite integral from some arbitrary constant \\(a\\) to \\(x = 4\\).

Using Python with libraries such as SciPy, we can perform this numerical integration.
