The indefinite integral of \\( (1 + x) \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\int (1 + x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nWe can split this into two separate integrals:\n\n\\[\n\\int 1 \\, dx + \\int x \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThe integral of 1 with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( x \\), and the integral of \\( x \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( \\frac{x^2}{2} \\). Therefore, the indefinite integral is:\n\n\\[\nx + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\n\\]\n\nSince we are asked to exclude the constant \\( C \\), we have:\n\n\\[\nx + \\frac{x^2}{2}\n\\]\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( x = 4 \\) into this expression:\n\n\\[\n4 + \\frac{4^2}{2} = 4 + \\frac{16}{2} = 4 + 8 = 12\n\\]\n\nFinally, rounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8981\u6c42$(1+x)$\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5c55\u5f00\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n\n$1+x$ \u5f97:$x=-1$\n\n\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f$1+x$."}]
