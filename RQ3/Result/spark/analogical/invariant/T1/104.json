[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution. Finally, provide the answer to the original problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        if e == id:\n            member_value = arr[e]\n        e += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The function `give_member` is designed to return the value at a specific index (`id`) in an array (`arr`).
