However, there are a few inefficiencies and potential issues with the current implementation. Let's break down the problems and then provide a corrected version.\n\n### Problems with the Current Implementation:\n1. **Initialization of `last_value`**: The initial value of `last_value` is set to `arr[0]`, which is fine if the array is non-empty. However, if the array is empty, this will raise an `IndexError`.\n2. **Loop Efficiency**: The loop iterates through the entire array, updating `last_value` each time. This is not necessary since we only need the last element.\n3. **Variable Naming**: The variable `n` is used as an index, but Python provides more readable ways to access the last element directly.\n\n### Corrected Version:\nTo make the function more efficient and handle edge cases (like an empty array), you can use Python's negative indexing feature.
