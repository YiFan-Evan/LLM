Let's identify and correct them step by step:\n\n1. The variable `i` is not defined in the outer loop. It should be initialized to `r`.\n2. The inner loop condition should use `z` instead of `i`.\n3. The swapping logic can be simplified using Python's tuple unpacking.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = 0\n    while r < len(arr):\n        z = r\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            # Swap elements\n            arr[z], arr[z - 1] = arr[z - 1], arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        r += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Outer Loop (`while r < len(arr)`):** This loop iterates over each element in the array starting from the first element.\n- **Inner Loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`):** This loop shifts elements that are greater than the current element (`arr[z]`) one position to the right until the correct position for `arr[z]` is found.\n- **Swapping Elements:** The line `arr[z], arr[z - 1] = arr[z - 1], arr[z]` swaps the elements at positions `z` and `z - 1`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\nThis implementation will correctly sort the input array using the insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = 0\n    while r <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        r += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code snippet for the insertion sort algorithm contains a few errors.
