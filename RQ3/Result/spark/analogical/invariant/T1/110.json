[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Initialize `k` to 0.\n3. Use a `while` loop to iterate through the array.\n4. Check if the current index `k` is equal to `id`.\n5. If true, set `member_value` to the value at `arr[k]`.\n6.
