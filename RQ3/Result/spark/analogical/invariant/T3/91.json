[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

However, there are a few issues with the current implementation that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The initial value of `last_value` is set to `arr[0]`, which is correct for non-empty arrays but will cause an error if the array is empty.\n2. The loop iterates through the entire array, updating `last_value` at each step, which is inefficient since we only need the last element.\n3. The variable `l` is used to keep track of the index, but this can be simplified by directly using Python's negative indexing.\n\nHere's a more efficient and robust version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef give_last(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        raise ValueError(\"Array is empty\")\n    return arr[-1]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Check for Empty Array**: Before attempting to access any elements, the function checks if the array is empty. If it is, it raises a `ValueError`.\n2. **Return Last Element**: By using `arr[-1]`, the function directly accesses the last element of the array, which is both simple and efficient.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nprint(give_last([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 4\nprint(give_last(['a', 'b', 'c']))  # Output: 'c'\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that the function works correctly for both non-empty and empty arrays."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_first(arr):\n    first_value = arr[-1]\n    l = len(arr)\n    while l > 0:\n        l -= 1\n        first_value = arr[l]\n    return first_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The function `give_first` is intended to return the first element of an array.
