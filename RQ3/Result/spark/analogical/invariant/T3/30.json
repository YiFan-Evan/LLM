Here\u2019s an alternative implementation for comparison:\n\n```python\ndef find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    for num in arr:\n        if num < min_value:\n            min_value = num\n    return min_value\n```\n\nBoth implementations will yield the same result, but the second one is generally easier to understand and follow."}]
