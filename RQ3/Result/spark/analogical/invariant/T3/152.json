This variable serves as a counter for iterating through the array in reverse order.\n\n2. **While Loop**:\n   - The loop runs as long as `m` is greater than 0.\n   - In each iteration, `m` is decremented by 1 (`m -= 1`), moving backward through the array.\n   - The element at index `m` of the array (`arr[m]`) is added to `sum_value`.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - Once the loop completes (i.e., when `m` equals 0), the function returns `sum_value`, which now contains the total sum of all elements in the array.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    m = len(arr)\n    while m > 0:\n        m -= 1\n        sum_value += arr[m]\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```python\n# Example array\nexample_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Calling the function with the example array\nresult = give_sum(example_array)\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(result)  # Output: 15\n```\n\nIn this example, the function calculates the sum of the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is `15`.\n\n### Explanation of the Loop Invariant:\n\nFor the i-th iteration of the loop (where `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(arr) - 1`):\n- `sum_value` holds the sum of the first `i` elements of the array.\n- `m` is the index of the next element to be added to `sum_value`.\n\nThis ensures that after each iteration, the correct portion of the array has been summed up correctly."}]
