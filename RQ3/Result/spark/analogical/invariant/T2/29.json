Let's break down how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `min_value` is initialized to the first element of the array, `arr[0]`.\n   - `j` is initialized to `-1`.\n\n2. **Loop through the array**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `j` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, which means it will iterate over all elements of the array.\n   - In each iteration, `j` is incremented by 1.\n   - The current element `arr[j]` is compared with `min_value`.
