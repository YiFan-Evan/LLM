Let's go through the issues and correct them step by step:\n\n1. The variable `i` is not defined before its use in the inner loop.\n2. The outer loop should start from index 1 instead of 0 because the first element is already considered sorted.\n3. The inner loop should use a different variable (e.g., `j`) to avoid confusion with the outer loop variable `n`.\n4. The swapping logic can be simplified using Python's tuple unpacking.\n\nHere is the corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Outer Loop**: Starts from index 1 (`for i in range(1, len(arr))`), as the first element is considered already sorted.\n- **Key**: Stores the current element to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array (`key = arr[i]`).\n- **Inner Loop**: Moves elements that are greater than the `key` one position to the right (`while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key`).\n- **Insertion**: Places the `key` in its correct position within the sorted portion of the array (`arr[j + 1] = key`).\n\nThis implementation ensures that each element is compared and placed correctly within the sorted portion of the array, resulting in a sorted list."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It looks like there are a few issues with the provided code for the insertion sort algorithm.
