However, there are a few inefficiencies and potential issues with the current implementation. Let's break down the problems and then provide a corrected version.\n\n### Problems with the Current Implementation:\n1. **Initialization of `last_value`**: The initial value of `last_value` is set to `arr[0]`, which is fine if the array is non-empty. However, if the array is empty, this will raise an `IndexError`.\n2. **Loop Efficiency**: The loop iterates through each element of the array, updating `last_value` each time. This is not necessary since we only need the last element.\n3. **Variable Naming**: The variable name `h` is not very descriptive. A more meaningful name would improve readability.\n\n### Corrected Version:\nTo make the function more efficient and handle edge cases (like an empty array), we can directly access the last element using negative indexing.
