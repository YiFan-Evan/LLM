Let's break down how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `sum_value` is initialized to 0. This variable will hold the cumulative sum of the elements in the array.\n   - `h` is initialized to -1. This variable serves as the index for iterating through the array.\n\n2. **Loop**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `h` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. This condition ensures that `h` will eventually reach the last valid index of the array (i.e., `len(arr) - 1`).\n   - In each iteration, `h` is incremented by 1.\n   - The element at index `h` of the array (`arr[h]`) is added to `sum_value`.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - Once the loop completes (i.e., when `h` equals `len(arr) - 1`), the function returns `sum_value`, which now contains the total sum of all elements in the array.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        sum_value += arr[h]\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\n# Example array\nexample_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\n# Calling the function with the example array\nresult = give_sum(example_array)\n\n# Printing the result\nprint(result)  # Output: 15\n```\n\nIn this example, the function calculates the sum of the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is `15`.\n\n### Alternative Approach\n\nAlthough your approach works correctly, it can be simplified using a more idiomatic Python construct like a `for` loop or the built-in `sum()` function. Here are two alternative ways to achieve the same result:\n\n#### Using a `for` loop:\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        sum_value += num\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n#### Using the built-in `sum()` function:\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    return sum(arr)\n```\n\nBoth of these alternatives are more concise and easier to read."}]
