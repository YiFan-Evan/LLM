From premises (1), (15), (19), and (20), we know that Rex is a lorpus, a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus.\n2. Using premise (8), since Rex is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus, it follows that Rex is a lorpus. This is consistent with premise (1).\n3. Since Rex is a sterpus (premise 12) and every sterpus is an impus (premise 4), it follows that Rex is an impus.\n4. Rex being a lorpus, a vumpus, and a dumpus (from premises 1, 10, and 15), according to premise (9), implies that Rex is a tumpus.\n5. Rex being a tumpus and a dumpus (from premises 10 and 17), and knowing that every wumpus is a tumpus (premise 5), if Rex were a wumpus, then Rex would be a tumpus, which is true. However, this doesn't necessarily mean Rex is a wumpus because being a tumpus doesn't imply being a wumpus directly.\n6. If Rex were a lempus, then by premise (11), Rex would be a wumpus. But being a wumpus implies being a tumpus (premise 5), which we already established in step 4. Thus, if Rex were a lempus, it would be both a tumpus and a wumpus, which is consistent with the information given.\n7. However, from premise (13), shumpuses are not impuses. Since Rex is an impus (step 3), Rex cannot be a shumpus.\n8. If Rex were a lempus, then by premise (7), Rex would be a rompus. But being a rompus does not conflict with any of the established facts about Rex so far.\n9. The critical point comes from premise (6): everything that is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus is a shumpus.
