Each rompus is a grimpus. (Premise 1)\n2. Every yumpus is a dumpus. (Premise 2)\n3. Rompuses are large. (Premise 3)\n4. Each numpus is not transparent. (Premise 5)\n5. Yumpuses are dull.

(Premise 24)\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n1. From premise 24, we know that Polly is a rompus.\n2. From premise 1, we know that each rompus is a grimpus. Therefore, Polly is a grimpus.\n3. From premise 19, we know that every zumpus is a rompus. Since Polly is a rompus, we don't need this directly, but it connects zumpuses with rompuses.\n4. From premise 10, we know that vumpuses are zumpuses. This means if something is a vumpus, it's also a zumpus.\n5. From premise 7, we know that gorpuses are numpuses. This connects gorpuses with numpuses.\n6. From premise 8, we know that each rompus is a gorpus. Since Polly is a rompus, Polly is also a gorpus.\n7. From premise 17, we know that each gorpus is shy. Since Polly is a gorpus, Polly is shy.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(8),(9),(17)->(25)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
