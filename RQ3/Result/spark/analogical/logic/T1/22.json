Given the premises, we can break it down as follows:\n\n1. From premise (14), Max is either a numpus, a dumpus, a zumpus, or a rompus.\n2. From premise (15), Max is also either a lempus, a numpus, a dumpus, or a zumpus.\n3. Since Max is a numpus, dumpus, zumpus, or rompus (from premise (14)) and each of these categories is established as being a shumpus (from premises (1), (5), (6), and (9), (10) respectively), we can conclude that Max is a shumpus.\n4. Alternatively, since Max is a lempus (from premise (15)) and every lempus is a sterpus (from premise (13)), but this does not directly link to being a shumpus, we rely on the other direct links from premise (14).\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that \"Max is a shumpus\" includes:\n- Premise (14): Max is a numpus or a dumpus or a zumpus or a rompus.\n- Premise (1): Every rompus is a shumpus.\n- Premise (5): Each dumpus is a shumpus.\n- Premise (6): Each numpus is a shumpus.\n- Premise (9): Each grimpus is a shumpus.\n- Premise (10): Each zumpus is a shumpus.\n\nThese premises collectively ensure that any entity that is a numpus, dumpus, zumpus, or rompus is a shumpus, covering all possibilities for Max from premise (14).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $(1), (5), (6), (9), (10), (14) \\rightarrow (16)$"}]
