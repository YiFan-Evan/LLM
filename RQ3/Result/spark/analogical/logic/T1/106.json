Sam is not an impus.\n\n**Solution Approach:**\n- From premises (1), (10), and (17), we need to show that Sam cannot be an impus.\n- Premise (10) states that each impus is a grimpus, a gorpus, and a jompus.\n- We know from premise (7) that every gorpus is a tumpus. Since Sam is a tumpus (premise 3), if Sam were an impus, he would also be a gorpus, hence a tumpus, which he already is.\n- Premise (9) states that each zumpus is a jompus. Since Sam is a zumpus (premise 11), he is also a jompus.\n- Premise (4) states that everything that is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus is not a jompus. However, since Sam is a yumpus, rompus, and lempus (premises 5, 15, 16), he should not be a jompus according to this rule.\n- But Sam is indeed a jompus (from being a zumpus as per premise 9). This creates a contradiction with premise (4), indicating that the conditions for Sam being a yumpus, rompus, and lempus simultaneously cannot hold true if he were an impus.\n- Therefore, Sam cannot be an impus because it would lead to him being both a jompus and not a jompus simultaneously, which is impossible.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(3),(5),(6),(9),(10),(11),(12)->(17)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
