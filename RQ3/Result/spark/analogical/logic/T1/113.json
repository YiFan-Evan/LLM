Therefore, if Max is a tumpus, then Max is a numpus, a sterpus, and a wumpus.\n\n2. **Use premise (8):**\n   - Max is a brimpus.\n\n3. **Use premise (5):**\n   - Brimpuses are numpuses. Since Max is a brimpus, Max is also a numpus.\n\n4. **Combine steps 1 and 3:**\n   - We have established that Max is a numpus both from being a brimpus and from being a tumpus.\n\n5. **Use premise (2):**\n   - Dumpuses are not numpuses. This means if Max were a dumpus, Max could not be a numpus.\n\n6. **Use premise (9):**\n   - Dumpuses are rompuses. If Max were a dumpus, Max would be a rompus.\n\n7. **Use premise (10):**\n   - Each tumpus is a rompus. If Max were a tumpus, Max would be a rompus.\n\n8. **Use premise (12):**\n   - Max is an impus, a dumpus, and a jompus. Since Max is a dumpus, Max is a rompus (from premise 9).\n\n9. **Combine steps 7 and 8:**\n   - Max is a rompus both from being a tumpus and from being a dumpus.\n\n10. **Use premise (1):**\n    - Every jompus is a rompus. Since Max is a jompus (from premise 12), Max is a rompus.\n\n11. **Combine steps 9 and 10:**\n    - Max is a rompus both from being a jompus and from being a dumpus/tumpus.\n\n12. **Check for contradictions:**\n    - There is no direct contradiction found so far. However, we need to ensure all conditions are satisfied without contradiction when assuming Max is a tumpus.\n\n13. **Revisit premise (2):**\n    - Dumpuses are not numpuses. Since Max is a dumpus, Max cannot be a numpus. This contradicts our earlier conclusion that Max is a numpus from being a brimpus and a tumpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSince we reached a contradiction (Max cannot be both a numpus and not a numpus), our initial assumption that Max is a tumpus must be false.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $(8),(5),(2)->(13)$"}]
