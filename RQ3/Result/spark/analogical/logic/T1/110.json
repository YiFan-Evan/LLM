This means Sam could potentially be a brimpus. However, being a brimpus does not directly help us prove that Sam is a numpus.\n   - Since Sam is an impus, from premise (7), each impus is a zumpus and a lorpus. This gives us more information about Sam's characteristics but does not directly link to being a numpus.\n\n3. **Finding a Path to Shumpus:**\n   - From premise (4), rompuses are impuses and shumpuses. Since Sam is a rompus, Sam is also an impus (which we already knew) and a shumpus.\n\n4. **Using the Shumpus Information:**\n   - From premise (1), every shumpus is a gorpus and a numpus. Since Sam is a shumpus, Sam must also be a gorpus and a numpus.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - By establishing that Sam is a shumpus and applying the properties of shumpuses, we can conclude that Sam is indeed a numpus.\n\nTherefore, by the chain of logic starting from Sam being an impus and a rompus, leading to Sam being identified as a shumpus through the definition of rompuses, and finally applying the properties of shumpuses, we can conclude that Sam is a numpus.\n\nThus, the final answer is: (9),(4),(1)->(11)."}]
