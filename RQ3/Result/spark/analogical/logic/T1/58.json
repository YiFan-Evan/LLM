Let's break down the premises and see how they can be combined:\n\n1. **Premise (8)** states that every sterpus is fast, moderate, a lorpus, and a gorpus. This means that if something is a sterpus, it must have these characteristics.\n\n2. **Premise (6)** tells us that Gorpuses are red, brown, wumpuses, and zumpuses. This implies that any entity that is a gorpus must also be red, brown, a wumpus, or a zumpus.\n\n3. **Premise (9)** provides information about Fae, stating that Fae is red, brown, a wumpus, and a zumpus. This matches the characteristics of a gorpus as described in premise (6).\n\n4. **Premise (10)** describes Fae as kind, mean, a jompus, and an impus.
