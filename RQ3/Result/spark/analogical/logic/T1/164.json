Let's analyze the given premises and see if we can derive the desired conclusion.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**:\n   - We need to show that Fae is overcast and a sterpus.\n   - From the given premises, we know:\n     - Fae is overcast. (10)\n     - Fae is a zumpus. (11)\n     - Fae is nervous. (12)\n     - Fae is cold. (13)\n     - Fae is fruity. (14)\n     - Fae is a grimpus. (15)\n     - Fae is a brimpus.
