Let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. We start with Stella's properties from the premises:\n   - Stella is red (premise 12).\n   - Stella is a rompus (premise 13).\n   - Stella is sweet (premise 14).\n   - Stella is a tumpus (premise 15).\n   - Stella is large (premise 16).\n   - Stella is blue (premise 17).\n   - Stella is small (premise 18).\n   - Stella is sour (premise 19).\n\n2. Now, let's look at the definitions provided in the premises to see if any combination leads directly to the conclusion that Stella is \"blue and red and a jompus\":\n   - Premise 11 states: Everything that is blue and red and a jompus is a gorpus.\n     - This means if Stella is blue, red, and a jompus, then she is a gorpus.\n\n3. Next, we need to determine if Stella can be considered a \"jompus\" based on her other attributes:\n   - Premise 9 states: Everything that is small and large and a tumpus is a lorpus.\n     - Since Stella is both small (18) and large (16), and a tumpus (15), she qualifies as a lorpus but not necessarily as a jompus.\n   - However, there is no direct relationship given between being a lorpus and being a jompus in the premises.\n\n4. Let's check if being sweet and sour and a tumpus leads to being a jompus:\n   - Premise 6 states: Everything that is sweet and sour and a tumpus is a jompus.\n     - Since Stella is sweet (14), sour (19), and a tumpus (15), she meets the criteria to be a jompus.\n\n5. Now that we have established Stella is a jompus, we can combine this with her being blue and red to conclude she is a gorpus:\n   - From premise 11, since Stella is blue (17), red (12), and a jompus, she must be a gorpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation that Stella is blue and red and a jompus are: (12), (14), (15), (17), (19) -> (20).\n\nThe final answer is: (12), (14), (15), (17), (19) -> (20)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
