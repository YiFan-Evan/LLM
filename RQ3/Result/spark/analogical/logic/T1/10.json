To do this, we can use Premise (4) and Premise (2).\n\nFrom Premise (4), we know that Polly is not a yumpus. According to Premise (2), everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a yumpus. Therefore, if Polly were a brimpus or a wumpus, she would have to be a yumpus, which contradicts Premise (4).\n\nThus, by contradiction, we can conclude that Polly cannot be a brimpus or a wumpus because if she were, she would violate the condition set forth in Premise (4).\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises required to derive the proof obligation is (2) and (4).\n\nThe answer is: \"(2),(4)->(6)\"."}]
