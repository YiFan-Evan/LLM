We'll start by analyzing the relevant premises and their relationships.\n\n### Problem Analysis\n\n#### Premises:\n1. Everything that is a sterpus or an impus or a jompus is a dumpus.\n2. Every numpus is a lempus.\n3. Each vumpus is a rompus.\n4. Everything that is a sterpus or an impus or a jompus is a shumpus.\n5. Brimpuses are sterpuses.\n6.

Alex is a dumpus.\n11. Alex is a brimpus.\n\n#### Goal:\nProve: Alex is a tumpus.\n\n### Solution Steps\n\n**Step 1: Establish Alex's Status as a Dumpus**\n- **Premise 11** states that Alex is a brimpus.\n- **Premise 5** states that brimpuses are sterpuses. Therefore, Alex is a sterpus.\n- **Premise 1** states that everything that is a sterpus or an impus or a jompus is a dumpus. Since Alex is a sterpus, it follows that Alex is a dumpus.\n\n**Step 2: Determine the Nature of Shumpuses**\n- **Premise 7** states that shumpuses are tumpuses and numpuses and vumpuses. This means that being a shumpus implies being a tumpus.\n\n**Step 3: Connect Alex to Being a Shumpus**\n- **Premise 4** states that everything that is a sterpus or an impus or a jompus is a shumpus. Since Alex is a sterpus (from Step 1), it follows that Alex is a shumpus.\n\n**Step 4: Conclude That Alex Is a Tumpus**\n- From Step 3, we know that Alex is a shumpus.\n- **Premise 7** states that shumpuses are tumpuses. Therefore, since Alex is a shumpus, Alex must be a tumpus.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\\[ (1),(5),(11),(4),(7) \\rightarrow (12) \\]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

Since Alex is a sterpus, this reaffirms that Alex is a dumpus (which we already knew from Premise 10).\n- **Premise 4** states that everything that is a sterpus or an impus or a jompus is a shumpus.
