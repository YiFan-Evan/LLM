Here are three related but not identical problems along with their solutions:\n\nProblem 1:\nPremises:\n- (1) All cats are mammals.\n- (2) All mammals are animals.\n- (3) All dogs are mammals.\n- (4) Fido is a cat.\nProve: (5) Fido is an animal.\n\nSolution:\nFrom (4), Fido is a cat. From (1), all cats are mammals, so Fido is a mammal. From (2), all mammals are animals, so Fido is an animal. Therefore, (1),(4)->(5).\n\nProblem 2:\nPremises:\n- (1) All birds can fly.\n- (2) Sparrows are birds.\n- (3) Sparrows are small.\nProve: (4) Small birds can fly.\n\nSolution:\nFrom (2) and (3), sparrows are both birds and small. From (1), all birds can fly. Therefore, small birds (like sparrows) can fly. Hence, (1),(2),(3)->(4).\n\nProblem 3:\nPremises:\n- (1) If it rains, the ground gets wet.\n- (2) It is raining.\n- (3) Wet ground means muddy shoes.\nProve: (4) My shoes are muddy.\n\nSolution:\nFrom (2), it is raining. From (1), when it rains, the ground gets wet. From (3), wet ground means muddy shoes. Therefore, my shoes are muddy. Thus, (1),(2),(3)->(4).\n\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\n\nPremises:\n- (1) Stella is a zumpus.\n- (2) Each tumpus is a wumpus.\n- (3) Each sterpus is a wumpus.\n- (4) Jompuses are zumpuses.\n- (5) Impuses are wumpuses.\n- (6) Gorpuses are dumpuses.\n- (7) Each impus is a lorpus and a tumpus and a grimpus.\n- (8) Grimpuses are rompuses.\n- (9) Zumpuses are lorpuses.\n- (10) Every gorpus is an impus.\n- (11) Stella is a rompus, a zumpus, and a numpus.\n- (12) Stella is a sterpus, Stella is not a lorpus, and Stella is a jompus.\nProve: (13) Stella is not a gorpus.\n\nSolution:\nFrom (1), Stella is a zumpus. From (9), zumpuses are lorpuses, but from (12), Stella is not a lorpus. This creates a contradiction unless we find another way to resolve it. From (4), jompuses are zumpuses, and from (12), Stella is a jompus, which confirms she is a zumpus. From (7), each impus is a lorpus, a tumpus, and a grimpus, and from (10), every gorpus is an impus. Since Stella is not a lorpus (from (12)), she cannot be an impus (from (7)). Since she cannot be an impus, she cannot be a gorpus (from (10)).
