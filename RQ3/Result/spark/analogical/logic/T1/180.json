Every mother has a son.\n2. Everything that is a vumpus or an impus or a rompus is a tumpus.\n3. Everything that is a dumpus, a shumpus, or a wumpus is a tumpus.\n4. Each brimpus is a lorpus.\n5.

Sally is a yumpus and Sally is a brimpus and Sally is not a numpus.\n\n### Relevant Premises:\n- **Premise 11**: Sally is a rompus.\n- **Premise 12**: Sally is not a numpus.\n- **Premise 7**: Every rompus is a numpus.\n- **Premise 2**: Everything that is a dumpus, a shumpus, or a wumpus is a tumpus.\n- **Premise 6**: Everything that is a lorpus or a shumpus or a grimpus is a vumpus.\n- **Premise 5**: Everything that is a sterpus, a zumpus, or an impus is a shumpus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n1. From **Premise 11**: Sally is a rompus.\n2. From **Premise 7**: Every rompus is a numpus. Therefore, Sally is a numpus.\n3. From **Premise 12**: Sally is not a numpus. This contradicts the conclusion in step 2.\n4. To resolve this contradiction, we must assume that Sally cannot be both a rompus and not a numpus unless she is not covered by the conditions that make her a rompus lead to being a numpus.\n5. From **Premise 5**: If Sally were an impus, she would be a shumpus.\n6. From **Premise 6**: If Sally were a shumpus, she would be a vumpus.\n7. From **Premise 2**: If Sally were a vumpus, she would be a tumpus.\n8. Since Sally is not a numpus (from **Premise 12**), she cannot fulfill the condition in **Premise 7** that every rompus is a numpus if she were also an impus (leading to being a shumpus and then a vumpus).\n\nTherefore, to avoid contradiction, Sally must not be an impus.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe minimal set of premises required to prove that Sally is not an impus are:\n(5), (6), (7), (11), (12) -> (13)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(5), (6), (7), (11), (12) -> (13)"}]
