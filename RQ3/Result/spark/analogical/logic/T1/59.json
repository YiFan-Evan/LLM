Let's break down the necessary steps:\n\n1. **Prove that Alex is a grimpus**: From premise (15), we know that Alex is a shumpus. However, to prove that Alex is a grimpus, we need additional characteristics of Alex that align with the definition of a grimpus in premise (1).\n\n2. **Characteristics of Alex**:\n   - From premise (13) and (14), Alex is aggressive and angry.\n   - From premise (15), Alex is a shumpus.\n\n3. **Combining these characteristics**: Using premise (1), if something is angry, aggressive, and a shumpus, then it is a grimpus. Since Alex is angry, aggressive, and a shumpus (from premises 13, 14, and 15), we can conclude that Alex is a grimpus.\n\n4. **Proving that Alex is orange and red**:\n   - From premise (8), Alex is orange.\n   - From premise (9), Alex is red.\n\n5. **Combining all the characteristics**: Alex is orange, red, and a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(13),(14),(15),(8),(9)->(16)."}]
