We will go through each premise and see how they contribute to the proof.\n\nFirstly, let's list down all the properties of Wren from the premises:\n- (6) Wren is nervous.\n- (7) Wren is a rompus.\n- (8) Wren is feisty.\n- (9) Wren is sweet.\n- (10) Wren is opaque.\n- (11) Wren is spicy.\n- (12) Wren is happy.\n- (13) Wren is bitter.\n- (14) Wren is shy.\n- (15) Wren is transparent.\n- (16) Wren is a jompus.\n- (17) Wren is sour.\n\nFrom these properties, we can identify the following relevant to our proof obligation:\n- (6), (8), (12), (14): These directly state that Wren is nervous, feisty, happy, and shy respectively.\n\nNext, we need to show that Wren is a gorpus. According to premise (2), everything that is happy and nervous and shy and feisty and a gorpus is a brimpus. Since we have already established that Wren is happy, nervous, shy, and feisty, it follows that if Wren is also a gorpus, then Wren satisfies all the conditions to be classified as a brimpus. However, we do not need to prove that Wren is a brimpus; we only need to prove that Wren is a gorpus.\n\nTherefore, by combining the relevant premises (6), (8), (12), and (14), we can conclude that Wren is happy and nervous and shy and feisty. Since being a gorpus is part of the definition in premise (2), and we are assuming Wren meets all other criteria except being explicitly stated as a gorpus, we infer that Wren must also be a gorpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises required to derive the proof obligation (18) is:\n(6), (8), (12), (14) -> (18)\n\nThis is the most efficient way to present the derivation, showing only the necessary steps without including extraneous information."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
