You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

(2) Felix is a cat. Prove: Felix is an animal.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (1), we know that all cats belong to the category of animals.\n- From premise (2), we know that Felix is a cat.\n- Therefore, by applying the rule of universal instantiation to premise (1) with Felix as the instance, we can conclude that Felix is an animal.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises is $(1),(2) \\rightarrow (3)$.\n\n#### Problem 2\n**Description:** Given the premises (1) All mammals are warm-blooded. (2) All whales are mammals. Prove: All whales are warm-blooded.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (1), we know that the property of being warm-blooded applies to all members of the set of mammals.\n- From premise (2), we know that whales are included in the set of mammals.\n- By applying the transitive property of set inclusion, we can conclude that all whales are warm-blooded.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises is $(1),(2) \\rightarrow (3)$.\n\n#### Problem 3\n**Description:** Given the premises (1) If it rains, the ground gets wet. (2) It is raining. Prove: The ground is wet.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (1), we have a conditional statement that links rain to a wet ground.\n- From premise (2), we know that the antecedent of the conditional statement (it raining) is true.\n- By applying modus ponens to these two premises, we can conclude that the consequent (the ground getting wet) must also be true.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises is $(1),(2) \\rightarrow (3)$.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nGiven the original problem's premises and proof obligation, we need to derive that Fae is a zumpus.
