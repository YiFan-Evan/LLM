Therefore, Max is not a yumpus.\n\n3. **Combine Relevant Information:**\n   - From (9), jompuses are yumpuses. Since Max is a jompus (from (2)), then Max should be a yumpus. However, from step 2, we know Max is not a yumpus, which creates a contradiction unless we can resolve it with other premises.\n   - From (12), everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a yumpus.
