Let's analyze the given premises step by step:\n\n1. **Premise (3):** Everything that is blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus is an impus.\n   - This premise directly states the conditions for being an impus, but it also implies that any entity satisfying all these conditions (including being a grimpus) must be an impus.\n\n2. **Premises related to Polly's characteristics:**\n   - (16) Polly is blue.\n   - (20) Polly is orange.\n   - (14) Polly is brown.\n   - (17) Polly is red.\n   - (5) Everything that is windy and snowy and sunny and rainy and a zumpus is a grimpus.\n     - Polly has some of these characteristics (windy, snowy, sunny, rainy), but we need to confirm if she is a zumpus.\n   - (9) Polly is a zumpus.\n   - (15) Polly is windy.\n   - (12) Polly is snowy.\n   - (13) Polly is sunny.\n   - (18) Polly is rainy.\n\n3. **Combining Premises:**\n   - From (9), we know Polly is a zumpus.\n   - From (5), since Polly is windy, snowy, sunny, rainy, and a zumpus, she must be a grimpus.\n   - Now, combining this with her colors (blue, orange, brown, red) from premises (16), (20), (14), and (17), we can conclude that Polly satisfies all the conditions in premise (3).\n\nTherefore, using premises (3), (5), (9), (14), (16), (17), (20), we can derive the conclusion that Polly is blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n(3),(5),(9),(14),(16),(17),(20)->(22)."}]
