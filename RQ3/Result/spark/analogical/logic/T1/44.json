Alex is a lempus and Alex is not a numpus and Alex is a gorpus.\n\nWe need to prove that Alex is not a brimpus (prove: 11).\n\nFirst, let's analyze what it means for Alex to be a brimpus:\n- According to premise (5), brimpuses are jompuses, numpuses, and zumpuses.\n\nNow, let's see if Alex can be any of these:\n\n1. **Jompus**: Premise (8) states that each jompus is a grimpus. Since there is no information about Alex being a grimpus, we cannot conclude that Alex is a jompus.\n\n2. **Numpus**: Premise (4) states that every tumpus is a numpus. Since Alex is a tumpus (premise 7), Alex is a numpus. However, premise (10) also states that Alex is not a numpus. This creates a contradiction regarding whether Alex is a numpus or not.\n\n3. **Zumpus**: Premise (2) states that every zumpus is a vumpus. There is no information about Alex being a zumpus or a vumpus.\n\nGiven the contradiction in whether Alex is a numpus or not, we cannot definitively say that Alex fits the criteria for being a brimpus based on the given premises. However, the contradiction itself does not directly prove that Alex is not a brimpus.\n\nLet's look at another approach:\n\n- If Alex were a brimpus, then according to premise (6), every brimpus is a shumpus. We already know from premise (9) that Alex is a shumpus.\n- But, if Alex were a brimpus, then according to premise (5), Alex would also have to be a numpus, a jompus, and a zumpus. As discussed earlier, this creates a contradiction because Alex cannot simultaneously be and not be a numpus.\n\nTherefore, due to this contradiction, we can conclude that:\n\nAlex cannot be a brimpus.\n\nThus, the proof obligation (11) is satisfied, and we have proven that Alex is not a brimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (7),(9),(4),(10)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
