[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

However, no direct connection exists in the given premises. So, we explore other connections:\n   - From (5), brimpuses are vumpuses. But knowing Polly is a vumpus doesn't help us here since we already know she's a vumpus.\n   - From (6), each tumpus is a rompus and a lorpus. This is relevant because Polly is also a rompus and a lorpus (from premise 10).\n   - From (6), knowing Polly is a rompus and a lorpus, we can deduce that Polly is also a tumpus.\n\n4. **Final Connection**: Now, using the fact that Polly is a tumpus and referring back to premise (3), we see that gorpuses are tumpuses and dumpuses.
