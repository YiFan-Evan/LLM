[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

This means if something is either a lorpus or a zumpus, it must be a brimpus.\n\n#### Step 2: Analyze Premise 4\nPremise 4 states that Wren is not a brimpus. Combining this with the information from Premise 3, we can infer that since Wren is not a brimpus, Wren cannot be a lorpus or a zumpus because anything that is one of those would have to be a brimpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBy combining Premise 3 and Premise 4, we can deduce that Wren is not a zumpus and Wren is not a lorpus.
