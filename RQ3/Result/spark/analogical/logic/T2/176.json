Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, or a rompus is a zumpus.\n2. Each impus is a wumpus.\n3. Every jompus is a wumpus.\n4. Vumpuses are impuses.\n5. Vumpuses are sterpuses.\n6. Every impus is a shumpus, a tumpus, and a jompus.\n7. Each dumpus is a wumpus.\n8. Lorpuses are sterpuses.\n9. Each shumpus is a rompus.\n10. Sally is a wumpus, a yumpus, and a sterpus.\n11. Sally is a vumpus, a lorpus, and a dumpus.\n\n#### Prove:\n12. Sally is a lempus, a tumpus, or a grimpus.\n\n### Solution Steps\n\n1. From premise (10), we know that Sally is a wumpus, a yumpus, and a sterpus.\n2. From premise (1), since Sally is a yumpus, she must also be a zumpus.\n3. From premise (11), we know that Sally is a vumpus, a lorpus, and a dumpus.\n4. From premise (4) and (5), since Sally is a vumpus, she must be an impus and a sterpus (which we already knew from premise (10)).\n5. From premise (2), since Sally is an impus, she must be a wumpus (which we already knew).\n6. From premise (6), since Sally is an impus, she must also be a shumpus, a tumpus, and a jompus.\n7. From premise (9), since Sally is a shumpus, she must also be a rompus.\n8. Since Sally is a rompus (from step 7), and according to premise (1), being a rompus implies being a zumpus (which we already established).\n9. Combining all the roles Sally has been identified with: wumpus, yumpus, sterpus, zumpus, impus, shumpus, tumpus, jompus, rompus, vumpus, lorpus, and dumpus.\n\nNow, we need to determine if any of these roles directly imply that Sally is a lempus, a tumpus, or a grimpus.\n\n- **Lempus**: There is no direct mention of Sally being a lempus.\n- **Tumpus**: From premise (6), Sally is identified as a tumpus.\n- **Grimpus**: There is no direct mention of Sally being a grimpus.\n\nSince Sally is identified as a tumpus, which satisfies one of the conditions for being a lempus, a tumpus, or a grimpus, we have proven the required statement.\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is: `(1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11)->(12)`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sally is a vumpus, a lorpus, and a dumpus.

Sally is a vumpus, a lorpus, and a dumpus.\n2. Sally is a wumpus and a yumpus and a sterpus.\n3. Each shumpus is a rompus.\n4. Lorpuses are sterpuses.\n5. Each dumpus is a wumpus.\n6.

Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, or a rompus is a zumpus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n**Step 1: Identify Sally's Roles**\nFrom premise (1) and (2), we know:\n- Sally is a vumpus, a lorpus, and a dumpus.\n- Sally is a wumpus, a yumpus, and a sterpus.\n\n**Step 2: Connect Vumpuses to Other Roles**\nFrom premise (7) and (8):\n- Vumpuses are sterpuses.\n- Vumpuses are impuses.\nSince Sally is a vumpus, she is also a sterpus and an impus.\n\n**Step 3: Impuses and Their Roles**\nFrom premise (6) and (10):\n- Every impus is a shumpus, a tumpus, and a jompus.\n- Each impus is a wumpus.\nSince Sally is an impus, she is also a shumpus, a tumpus, and a jompus.\n\n**Step 4: Shumpuses and Jompuses**\nFrom premise (3) and (9):\n- Each shumpus is a rompus.\n- Every jompus is a wumpus.\nSince Sally is a shumpus and a jompus, she is also a rompus and a wumpus (which we already knew).\n\n**Step 5: Yumpuses and Tumpuses**\nFrom premise (11):\n- Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, or a rompus is a zumpus.\nSince Sally is a yumpus and a rompus, she is also a zumpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nSally has been identified as a wumpus, a yumpus, a sterpus, a shumpus, a tumpus, a jompus, a rompus, a dumpus, a vumpus, and a lorpus. Among these roles, she is explicitly a tumpus. Therefore, she satisfies one of the conditions for being a lempus, a tumpus, or a grimpus.\n\nThus, the proof is complete.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: `(1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11)->(12)`."}]
