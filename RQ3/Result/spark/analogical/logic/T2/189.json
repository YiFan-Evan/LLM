You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Therefore:\n- Alex is a tumpus.\n\nNext, we know that every tumpus is a sterpus (Premise 3). Therefore:\n- Alex is a sterpus.\n\nSince each sterpus is an impus (Premise 7), it follows that:\n- Alex is an impus.\n\nNow, we know that each impus is not snowy (Premise 18). Therefore:\n- Alex is not snowy.\n\nThus, we have proven the required conclusion:\n- **(25) Alex is not snowy.**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\text{(1),(2),(3),(7),(13),(18)->(25)} \\]"}]
