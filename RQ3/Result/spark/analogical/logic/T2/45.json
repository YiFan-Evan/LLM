Let's analyze the premises step by step:\n\nFrom (10) and (11), we know that Alex is both a jompus and a zumpus. Using these facts, let's see how they can help us reach the conclusion.\n\nSince Alex is a zumpus (from premise 11), and from premise 9, \"Everything that is cold or a tumpus is a zumpus,\" we can infer that Alex could be cold, a tumpus, or both. However, this does not directly help us with the proof obligation (12).\n\nNext, since Alex is a zumpus, from premise 8, \"Everything that is large or a zumpus is a numpus,\" we can infer that Alex is a numpus. This directly helps us with the proof obligation because if Alex is a numpus, then he satisfies one part of the disjunction in (12).\n\nTherefore, using only premise 8 and the fact that Alex is a zumpus (premise 11), we can conclude that Alex is a numpus. This fulfills the proof obligation (12) that Alex is luminous or a numpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises required to prove (12) is {(8), (11)}.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\n(8), (11) -> (12)\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is a zumpus.
