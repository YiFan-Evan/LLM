[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Since Rex is not a brimpus (from premise (10)), at least one of the conditions (being a shumpus, a yumpus, or a grimpus) must be false for Rex. However, premises (3), (11), and (13) confirm that Rex is a shumpus and a yumpus. Therefore, the only condition left that could be false is being a grimpus.
