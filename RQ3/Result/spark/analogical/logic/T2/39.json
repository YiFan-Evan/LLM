[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

This is crucial as it directly links Max to potentially being one of these creatures, all of which are yumpuses based on the other premises.\n   - Premise (12) states Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus. This also helps link Max to being a yumpus through being a jompus or a tumpus.\n\n2. **Formulate the Proof**:\n   - Since Max is either a jompus, a tumpus, or a shumpus (from premise 11), and every jompus and tumpus are yumpuses (from premises 4 and 7), then if Max is a jompus or a tumpus, Max is a yumpus.\n   - Additionally, since every shumpus is a numpus (from premise 6), and lorpuses are numpuses (from premise 9), if Max were a shumpus, he would still be linked to being a numpus, but not directly to being a yumpus without further information. However, since premise 12 also includes Max being a lorpus or a jompus, and being a lorpus does not directly relate to being a yumpus, we focus on the jompus and tumpus aspects.\n   - Therefore, by the principle of the disjunction (if P or Q or R, then P, Q, or R must be true), and knowing that being a jompus or a tumpus directly implies being a yumpus, we can conclude that Max is a yumpus.\n\n3. **Final Answer**:\n   - Therefore, the final answer is: (4),(7),(11)->(13)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus.
