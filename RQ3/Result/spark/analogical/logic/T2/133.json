According to (4), every wumpus is a grimpus, so Polly is also a grimpus.\n\nFrom (11), we also know that Polly is a lorpus. According to (9), each lorpus is a lempus, so Polly is also a lempus.\n\nFrom (11), we know that Polly is a tumpus. According to (6), tumpuses are impuses, so Polly is also an impus.\n\nSo far, we have established that Polly is a grimpus, a lempus, and an impus.\n\nFrom (5), we know that Polly is a zumpus. According to (7), each zumpus is a rompus, so Polly is also a rompus.\n\nNow, let's look at the implications of Polly being a rompus:\n\nIf Polly were a vumpus, then according to (1), she would be a rompus. But we already know from (5) and (7) that Polly is a rompus for other reasons (she's a zumpus). Therefore, the fact that Polly is a rompus does not necessarily mean she is a vumpus.\n\nHowever, if Polly were a vumpus, then according to (2) and (3), she would also be a zumpus. Since we already know from (5) that Polly is a zumpus, this does not provide any new information about whether Polly is a vumpus or not.\n\nThe key lies in the fact that Polly is already established as a rompus through her status as a zumpus. If Polly were a vumpus, she would still be a rompus, but since she is already a rompus without being a vumpus, there is no need to invoke the vumpus condition to establish her as a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the fact that Polly is a rompus does not imply that she must be a vumpus. Since being a rompus is consistent with being a jompus or a dumpus according to (1), and being a zumpus is consistent with being a vumpus, a sterpus, or an impus according to (2) and (3), there is no contradiction in Polly being a rompus without being a vumpus.\n\nThus, the only way to conclude that Polly is not a vumpus is if being a rompus excludes the possibility of being a vumpus. However, this is not stated in the premises. The premises only state that being a vumpus implies being a rompus, not that being a rompus excludes being a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot prove that Polly is not a vumpus.
