Let's analyze the relevant premises step by step:\n\n1. From premise (1), we know that wumpuses are opaque and lempuses. This doesn't directly help us prove that Wren is a brimpus, but it provides information about wumpuses.\n\n2. Premise (2) states that each grimpus is feisty and a shumpus and a rompus. This also doesn't directly relate to proving that Wren is a brimpus, but it gives us more information about grimpuses.\n\n3. Premise (3) tells us that brimpuses are blue, yumpuses, and jompuses. This is crucial because it defines what a brimpus is. To prove that Wren is a brimpus, we need to show that Wren is blue, a yumpus, and a jompus.\n\n4. Premise (4) states that lempuses are spicy and brimpuses and grimpuses. This helps us link lempuses to brimpuses, but we already know from premise (1) that wumpuses are lempuses, so this doesn't add new information for our proof.\n\n5. Premise (5) says that every yumpus is bright and a zumpus and a numpus. This defines what a yumpus is, which is relevant because we need to show that Wren is a yumpus to prove that Wren is a brimpus.\n\n6. Premise (6) states that every jompus is temperate, a wumpus, and a tumpus. This is important because it links jompuses to wumpuses, and we know from premise (7) that every wumpus is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus.\n\n7. Premise (7) tells us that every wumpus is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus. This is useful because we know from premise (9) that Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus, which means Wren must be a wumpus.\n\n8. Premise (8) states that each dumpus is small and large and a gorpus. This doesn't seem relevant to proving that Wren is a brimpus.\n\n9. Premise (9) tells us that Wren is opaque and a lempus and a grimpus. This is useful because it directly links Wren to being a lempus and a grimpus. Since we know from premise (1) that wumpuses are opaque and lempuses, and from premise (7) that every wumpus is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus, and since Wren is also sunny, a sterpus, and an impus from premise (10), we can conclude that Wren is a wumpus.\n\n10. Premise (10) states that Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus. This confirms the information from premise (9) and adds that Wren is also a sterpus and an impus.\n\nNow, let's combine the relevant information:\n\n- From premise (9), we know that Wren is a lempus.\n- From premise (1), we know that wumpuses are lempuses.\n- From premise (7), we know that every wumpus is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus.\n- From premise (10), we know that Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus.\n\nSince Wren matches the description of a wumpus (from premises (7) and (10)), and we know from premise (1) that wumpuses are lempuses, and from premise (9) that Wren is a lempus, we can conclude that Wren is a wumpus.\n\nSince Wren is a wumpus, and from premise (6) we know that every jompus is a wumpus, we can infer that Wren is also a jompus.\n\nNow, we need to show that Wren is a yumpus to satisfy the definition of a brimpus from premise (3).

According to premise (8), a brimpus must be blue, a yumpus, and a jompus. We will use the given premises to deduce this.\n\n1. **Wren is a jompus**: From premise (4), we know that every wumpus is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus. Since Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus (premise (1)), Wren must be a wumpus. From premise (5), we know that every jompus is a wumpus. Therefore, since Wren is a wumpus, Wren must also be a jompus.\n\n2. **Wren is a yumpus**: To prove that Wren is a yumpus, we need to find a connection between Wren and the properties of a yumpus. Premise (6) states that every yumpus is bright and a zumpus and a numpus. However, there isn't a direct link between being bright or being a zumpus/numpus and Wren from the given premises. We need to find an alternative route to connect Wren to being a yumpus.\n\n3. **Wren is blue**: There is no direct information in the premises that states Wren is blue. However, we can explore if being blue is a necessary condition for being a brimpus or if it's just one of the characteristics. Since proving Wren is blue doesn't seem directly possible with the given information, we focus on proving the other conditions first.\n\nGiven the above analysis, we can only definitively prove that Wren is a jompus based on the premises provided.
