Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. From premise (4), we know that Lempuses are numpuses.\n2. From premise (10), we know Sam is a numpus and a sterpus.\n3. Since Sam is a numpus, and every numpus is a sterpus (from premise (1)), we can confirm that Sam is indeed a sterpus. This matches with the information given in premise (10).\n4. Now, from premise (8), we know that each sterpus is a zumpus and an impus. Therefore, Sam, being a sterpus, is also a zumpus and an impus.\n5. Next, from premise (6), we know that every wumpus is a yumpus and a lorpus. However, we need to find a connection between being a sterpus or a numpus and being a wumpus.\n6. Looking at premise (3), we see that gorpuses are wumpuses and shumpuses. This suggests that if something is a gorpus, then it is also a wumpus.\n7. From premise (1), we know that every numpus is a gorpus. Since Sam is a numpus (as established in step 2), Sam must also be a gorpus.\n8. Combining the information from steps 6 and 7, we can conclude that since Sam is a gorpus, Sam must also be a wumpus.\n\nTherefore, using the given premises and logical deduction, we have proven that Sam is a wumpus.
