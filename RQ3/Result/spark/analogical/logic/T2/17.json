Therefore, Max is a numpus.\n   - From (13), each numpus is a lempus. Therefore, Max is a lempus.\n   - From (6), lempuses are zumpuses. Therefore, Max is a zumpus.\n   - From (22), zumpuses are shumpuses. Therefore, Max is a shumpus.\n   - From (21), lempuses are zumpuses. Therefore, Max is a zumpus.\n   - From (4), lempuses are grimpuses. Therefore, Max is a grimpus.\n\n3. **Link Zumpus to Wumpus**: To connect Max (who is now established as a zumpus) to wumpus, we use:\n   - From (3), zumpuses are wumpuses. Therefore, Max is a wumpus.\n\n4. **Final Step to Conclusion**: Now that we have established Max as a wumpus, we can use the premise:\n   - From (17), every wumpus is not moderate.\n   - Since Max is a wumpus, it follows that Max is not moderate.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\n(2), (19), (13), (6), (4), (22), (3), (17) -> (25)\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe minimal set of premises that leads to the conclusion that \"Max is not moderate\" is:\n(2), (19), (13), (6), (4), (22), (3), (17) -> (25)"}]
