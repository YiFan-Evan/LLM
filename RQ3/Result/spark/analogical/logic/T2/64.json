Everything that is rainy or a zumpus is a vumpus.\n2. Everything that is small or a rompus is a wumpus.\n3. Everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus.\n4. Everything that is spicy or a numpus is a jompus.\n5. Everything that is discordant or a tumpus is a zumpus.\n6. Everything that is floral or a zumpus is a dumpus.\n7.

Rex is a rompus.\n\n**Proof Obligation:**\n\n12. Rex is transparent or a jompus.\n\n**Solution Steps:**\n\n1. From premise (10), we know Rex is a numpus.\n2. From premise (8), since Rex is a numpus, Rex is also a brimpus. This doesn't help directly with the proof obligation.\n3. From premise (11), we know Rex is a rompus.\n4. From premise (2), since Rex is a rompus, Rex is also a wumpus. This doesn't help directly with the proof obligation either.\n5. We need to find a connection between being a numpus or rompus and being transparent or a jompus. Premise (4) connects spicy or numpus to jompus, but we don't have information on whether Rex is spicy.\n6. However, if we look at premise (5), it states that everything that is discordant or a tumpus is a zumpus. If we can establish that Rex is a tumpus, then Rex would be a zumpus, which could lead to other deductions.\n7. To establish Rex as a tumpus, we can use premise (3), which states that everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus. If Rex were transparent or a jompus, then he would be a tumpus.\n8. Since we are trying to prove that Rex is transparent or a jompus, we can assume one of these conditions to be true for the sake of contradiction. If Rex were not transparent, then by premise (3), Rex must be a jompus.\n9. Therefore, if Rex is a jompus, then by premise (4), Rex being a numpus implies Rex is a jompus, which aligns with our assumption.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis above, the minimal set of premises that allows us to deduce the proof obligation (12) \"Rex is transparent or a jompus\" is:\n\n(10), (3) -> (12)\n\nThis means that from premise (10) \"Rex is a numpus\" and premise (3) \"Everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus,\" we can conclude that Rex must be transparent or a jompus to satisfy the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10), (3) -> (12)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a rompus.
