Start with the most direct information we have about Rex:\n   - Rex is a jompus (24).\n   - Rex is a numpus (24).\n\n2. Use the fact that Rex is a jompus and link it to other relevant propositions:\n   - Every jompus is a tumpus (22).\n\n3. Now, use the fact that Rex is a numpus to connect it to other relevant propositions:\n   - Numpuses are rompuses (1).\n\n4. We now have:\n   - Rex is a jompus.\n   - Rex is a tumpus (from 22).\n   - Rex is a rompus (from 1).\n\n5. From here, we need to connect rompuses to something sweet. However, there's no direct connection. So we look for connections between rompuses and impuses, as impuses are sweet (11):\n   - Each impus is a dumpus (2).\n   - Dumpuses are fruity (6).\n\n6.

There's no direct connection from rompuses to impuses using the given premises. Let's try another route:\n    - Every brimpus is not melodic (5).\n    - Tumpuses are brimpuses (16).\n\n11. This means every tumpus is not melodic. But we already know Rex is a tumpus (from 22), so:\n    - Rex is not melodic.\n\n12. This still doesn't help us connect rompuses to impuses.
