From premise (1), we know that Rex is a lorpus.\n2. Premise (8) states that everything that is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus is a lorpus. Since Rex is a lorpus from premise (1), and also stated to be a vumpus, numpus, and yumpus in premises (15), (19), and (20) respectively, these support the fact that Rex fits the description of being a lorpus according to premise (8).\n3. Premise (11) tells us that lempuses are wumpuses. This means if Rex were a lempus, he would also be a wumpus.\n4. Premise (2) states that every wumpus is a lempus, among other things. This implies a mutual relationship where being a wumpus necessitates being a lempus and vice versa.\n5. However, if we assume that Rex is not a lempus as per the proof obligation (21), it would contradict the chain established in premises (11) and (2), since being a wumpus (which Rex is due to being a lorpus and thereby fulfilling the conditions of premise (8)) should make him a lempus.\n6. This creates a contradiction because Rex being a wumpus (as deduced from being a lorpus and fitting the criteria of premise (8)) necessitates that he must be a lempus (due to premise (2)), directly conflicting with the assumption that Rex is not a lempus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(1),(2),(8),(11),(21)->(21)\n\nThis indicates that the set of premises (1), (2), (8), and (11) leads to a contradiction with the proof obligation (21), proving that the original claim \"Rex is not a lempus\" cannot be true based on the given premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a yumpus.

Combining these with premise (15), we deduce that Rex is a shumpus because he is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus.\n4. Premise (8) states that shumpuses are not impuses. Therefore, Rex being a shumpus implies that Rex is not an impus.\n5. Premise (17) states that each sterpus is an impus. Since Rex is a sterpus from premise (9), this means Rex is an impus.\n6. However, this creates a contradiction because in step 4, we concluded that Rex is not an impus due to being a shumpus, but in step 5, we concluded that Rex is an impus due to being a sterpus.\n\nThis contradiction indicates that our initial assumption that Rex could be a lempus must be incorrect, as it leads to conflicting conclusions about whether Rex is an impus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(3),(6),(8),(9),(15),(17)->(21)\n\nThis means that the set of premises (3), (6), (8), (9), (15), and (17) leads to a contradiction, proving that the original claim \"Rex is not a lempus\" cannot be true based on the given premises."}]
