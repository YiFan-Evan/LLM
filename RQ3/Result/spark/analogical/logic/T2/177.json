From premise (16) and the chain of logic from steps 7 and 9, we can conclude that since Rex is a wumpus and wumpuses are lorpuses (from premise 20), and if we assume that being a wumpus somehow implies being a rompus (which is not explicitly stated but inferred through the chain of logic involving being a lorpus and then a rompus), then Rex would be a grimpus and thus not sour.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (19),(17),(11),(9),(10),(14),(15),(1),(16),(18)->(21)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a wumpus.
