This directly implies that if someone is a gorpuses, they are also a jompus.\n\nSince Sam is established as a gorpuses, and all gorpuses are jompuses (from Proposition 5), it follows that Sam is a jompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (9),(6),(5)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sam is a vumpus and a dumpus.
