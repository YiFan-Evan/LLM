For this, we need to establish a connection between being a numpus and being a tumpus.\n- Premise 9 states: \"Everything that is muffled and a yumpus is a numpus.\" However, there is no direct information linking Wren to being muffled or a yumpus.\n- We need another route to connect Wren being a numpus to being a tumpus. Looking at premise 5, \"Everything that is wooden and a numpus is a tumpus,\" we see that if Wren is wooden and a numpus, then Wren must be a tumpus.\n- Since Wren is already established as wooden (premise 16) and a numpus (premise 14), we can use premise 5 to conclude that Wren is a tumpus.\n\nCombining the facts that Wren is sunny (premise 15) and Wren is a tumpus (derived from being wooden and a numpus using premise 5), we can now state that Wren is sunny and a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(4),(5),(14),(15),(16)->(17)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Wren is wooden.
