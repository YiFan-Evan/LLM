Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**: We start by identifying which premises are directly related to Stella and transparency. From the list, (24) tells us Stella is a brimpus, and (10) states that rompuses are transparent. Additionally, (15) connects every rompus with being a dumpus, and (16) indicates every dumpus is nervous, but nervousness isn't relevant here.\n\n2. **Establish Connections**: Next, we establish how Stella's being a brimpus relates to her being a rompus. Premise (20) states each grimpus is a rompus, and (21) says vumpuses are grimpuses. However, we need a direct link between brimpus and rompus. Premise (2) comes into play here, stating every brimpus is a vumpus, which, combined with (21), implies every brimpus is also a grimpus, thus a rompus.\n\n3. **Combine for Transparency**: Now that we've established Stella as a rompus through her being a brimpus and then a vumpus/grimpus, we can use (10) to conclude she is transparent since all rompuses are transparent.\n\n4. **Formalize the Proof**:\n   - (24) Stella is a brimpus.\n   - (2) Every brimpus is a vumpus. => Stella is a vumpus.\n   - (21) Vumpuses are grimpuses. => Stella is a grimpus.\n   - (20) Each grimpus is a rompus. => Stella is a rompus.\n   - (10) Rompuses are transparent. => Stella is transparent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (24),(2),(21),(20),(10)->(25)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Stella is a brimpus.

To connect her to transparency, we need to establish a relationship between brimpus/jompus and rompus.\n\n3. **Combine Premises**:\n   - From (23), we know every brimpus is a vumpus. Since Stella is a brimpus (premise 1), she is also a vumpus.\n   - From (4), we know vumpuses are grimpuses. Therefore, Stella is a grimpus.\n   - From (5), we know each grimpus is a rompus. Thus, Stella is a rompus.\n   - Finally, from (15), we know rompuses are transparent.
