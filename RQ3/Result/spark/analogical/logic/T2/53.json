Everything that is a yumpus and a tumpus and a lorpus is not a grimpus.\n12. Max is a yumpus.\n13. Max is a brimpus.\n14. Max is a tumpus.\n15. Max is a lorpus.\n\n### Proof Obligation:\n16. Max is not a numpus.\n\n### Solution Process:\n\n1. From premises 2, 12, 14, and 15, we know that Max is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus.\n   - Therefore, by premise 1, **Max is a brimpus**.\n\n2. From premise 13, we already know **Max is a brimpus**.\n\n3. From premises 3 and 7, we know that every wumpus is a grimpus and Max is a wumpus.\n   - Therefore, **Max is a grimpus**.\n\n4. From premises 1 and 11, everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus is not a grimpus, but since Max is all three, he should not be a grimpus based on this rule. However, we have established in step 3 that Max is indeed a grimpus due to being a wumpus. This creates a contradiction unless there's another condition that overrides this rule.\n\n5. We need to find a way to reconcile these contradictions. Since Max cannot be both a brimpus (from being a yumpus, tumpus, and lorpus) and not a grimpus (from being all three), we look for other conditions.\n\n6. From premise 4 and 5, anything that is a numpus must be a grimpus and a brimpus. But we already established that Max is a grimpus and a brimpus through other means.\n\n7. From premise 6 and 10, Max being an impus and a yumpus and a lempus makes him a vumpus.\n   - Therefore, **Max is a vumpus**.\n\n8. From premise 8, everything that is a numpus is a rompus. If Max were a numpus, he would also be a rompus, which does not conflict with any of the established facts about Max so far.\n\n9. To prove that Max is not a numpus, we need to show that being a numpus would contradict one of the established facts about Max. Since being a numpus would make Max both a brimpus and a grimpus (from premises 4 and 5), and we've already established that Max is both, this route doesn't help us prove he isn't a numpus.\n\n10. The key lies in the fact that being a numpus would imply Max is both a brimpus and a grimpus, but we've established that Max being all three (a yumpus, tumpus, lorpus) should make him not a grimpus according to premise 11, which contradicts our finding in step 3. Thus, Max can't be a numpus without causing a logical inconsistency.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **(1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(12),(13),(14),(15)->(16)**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a lorpus.
