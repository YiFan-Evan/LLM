From the list of premises, we can see that premise (1) states that each impus is a lorpus. Premise (10) states that each impus is also a grimpus, a gorpus, and a jompus. These two premises directly relate to the concept of an impus.\n\n2. **Contradiction with Sam's Attributes**: To prove that Sam is not an impus, we need to show that Sam does not meet the criteria for being an impus as defined in the premises. We know from premise (17) that we need to prove that Sam is not an impus.\n\n3. **Use of Intermediate Conclusions**: We can use intermediate conclusions derived from other premises to help us reach our goal. For example, premise (11) tells us that Sam is a zumpus. Premise (9) then tells us that each zumpus is a jompus. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam is a jompus.\n\n4. **Combining Premises**: Now, let's combine the relevant premises to form a chain of reasoning:\n   - From (10), we know that each impus is a grimpus, a gorpus, and a jompus.\n   - From (11), we know that Sam is a zumpus.\n   - From (9), we know that each zumpus is a jompus.\n   - Therefore, if Sam were an impus, he would be both a jompus (from being a zumpus) and a grimpus, a gorpus, and a jompus (from being an impus).\n\n5. **Finding a Contradiction**: The contradiction arises because if Sam were an impus, he would have to be both a jompus and not a jompus at the same time, which is impossible. Since Sam is already established as a jompus through the chain of reasoning above, he cannot also be an impus without violating the definition of an impus given in premise (10).\n\n6. **Formalizing the Proof**:\n   - (10),(11),(9)->(17)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(11),(9)->(17)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sam is a lempus.
