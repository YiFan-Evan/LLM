Let's break down the given information step-by-step.\n\nFirstly, let's list out the relevant information:\n\n1. Everything that is large, small, or a yumpus is a wumpus.\n2. Everything that is dull, bright, or a rompus is a lempus.\n3. Everything that is orange or blue or a rompus is a grimpus.\n4. Everything that is kind, angry, or a grimpus is a yumpus.\n5. Everything that is transparent or opaque or a grimpus is a zumpus.\n6. Everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus.\n7. Everything that is happy, shy, or a jompus is a tumpus.\n8. Everything that is sour or bitter or a shumpus is an impus.\n9. Everything that is fruity, floral, or a jompus is a gorpus.\n10. Everything that is overcast, sunny, or a vumpus is a sterpus.\n11.
