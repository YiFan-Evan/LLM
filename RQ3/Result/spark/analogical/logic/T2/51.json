(2) Felix is a cat. Prove: Felix is an animal.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (1), we know that all cats belong to the category of animals.\n- From premise (2), we know that Felix is a cat.\n- Therefore, by applying the rule of universal instantiation to premise (1) with Felix as the instance, we can conclude that Felix is an animal.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises is $(1),(2) \\rightarrow (3)$.\n\n#### Problem 2\n**Description:** Given the premises (1) All mammals are warm-blooded. (2) All whales are mammals. Prove: All whales are warm-blooded.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (1), we know that the set of all mammals is included in the set of warm-blooded animals.\n- From premise (2), we know that whales belong to the set of mammals.\n- By applying the transitive property of set inclusion, since whales are mammals and all mammals are warm-blooded, it follows that all whales are warm-blooded.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises is $(1),(2) \\rightarrow (3)$.\n\n#### Problem 3\n**Description:** Given the premises (1) If it rains, the ground gets wet. (2) It is raining. Prove: The ground is wet.\n\n**Solution:**\n- From premise (1), we have a conditional statement that if it rains, then the ground gets wet.\n- From premise (2), we know that it is indeed raining.\n- By applying modus ponens to these two premises, we can conclude that the ground is wet.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises is $(1),(2) \\rightarrow (3)$.\n\n### Solution to the Original Problem\n\nGiven the original problem's premises and proof obligation, let's derive the conclusion step by step:\n\n1. From premise (7), we know Fae is an impus.\n2. From premise (1), we know each impus is a grimpus. Therefore, Fae is a grimpus.\n3. From premise (6), we know Fae is a vumpus.\n4. From premise (2), everything that is a vumpus or a dumpus or a gorpus is a zumpus. Since Fae is a vumpus, Fae is a zumpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Fae is a zumpus is $(1),(2),(6),(7) \\rightarrow (8)$.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $(1),(2),(6),(7)->(8)$."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is a vumpus and a numpus and an impus.
