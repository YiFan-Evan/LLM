Thus, there must be an error in the premises or the interpretation.\n\n4. **Reevaluate the Premises**:\n   - Upon re-examination, we see that Premise 1 directly states that Sally is not a vumpus, while Premise 3 states that every shumpus is a vumpus. This means that if Sally is a shumpus, she must be a vumpus, but this contradicts Premise 1.\n   - Therefore, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that Sally cannot be both a shumpus and not a vumpus simultaneously.\n\n5. **Formulate the Conclusion**:\n   - Given the contradiction between Premise 1 and Premise 3, we must conclude that either Sally is not a shumpus or there is an error in the premises provided. However, based on the information given, we can deduce that Sally cannot be a wumpus because being a wumpus requires being a vumpus (Premise 4), and Sally is explicitly stated to not be a vumpus (Premise 1).\n\n### Final Answer\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n(1), (2), (3), (4) \\rightarrow (14)\n\\]"}]
