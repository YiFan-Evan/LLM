Max is not an impus.\n\nLet's break down the proof step-by-step:\n\nFrom (2), (9), and (13), we know that:\n- Max is a jompus.\n- Jompuses are yumpuses.\n- Max is a yumpus.\n\nFrom (1), we know that:\n- Each lempus is not a yumpus.\n\nSince Max is a yumpus (from the above steps) and each lempus is not a yumpus, it follows that:\n- Max is not a lempus.\n\nHowever, from (14), we know that:\n- Max is a lempus.\n\nThis creates a contradiction because we have established both that Max is a lempus and that Max is not a lempus. To resolve this contradiction, we must assume that one of the premises leading to this contradiction is incorrect or irrelevant to proving (17). Let's focus on proving (17) without considering the contradictory information about Max being a lempus.\n\nFrom (15) and (16), we know that:\n- Max is a zumpus.\n- Max is a tumpus.\n\nFrom (8), we know that:\n- Everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a grimpus.\n\nIf Max were an impus, then by (8), Max would also be a grimpus. However, there is no direct information given that states Max is a grimpus, and our goal is to prove that Max is not an impus. Therefore, we do not need to consider whether Max is a grimpus or not for this proof.\n\nFrom (12), we know that:\n- Everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a yumpus.\n\nSince we already know from the steps above that Max is a yumpus (from being a jompus), and Max is also a zumpus and a tumpus (from (15) and (16)), if Max were an impus, then he would be described by (12), which would make him a yumpus again (which he already is). This does not help us prove that Max is not an impus.\n\nTherefore, the only way to avoid a contradiction and prove (17) without relying on the contradictory information about Max being a lempus is to use the information that directly relates to Max not being an impus. Since there are no premises that directly state Max is not an impus, and since the contradiction about Max being a lempus does not affect the proof of (17), we can conclude that the minimal set of premises needed to derive (17) is actually empty because there are no premises that directly lead to the conclusion that Max is not an impus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(No premises provided) -> (17)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a tumpus.
