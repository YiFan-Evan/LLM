However, this information does not directly help us prove (8).\n- From premise (7), we know that Max is a sterpus.\n- From premise (5), since Max is a sterpus, he must be a jompus. Again, this information does not directly help us prove (8).\n- Now, let's use premise (3): everything that is moderate, fast, or a tumpus is a lorpus. Since Max is a tumpus (from premise (6)), it follows that Max is a lorpus.\n- With Max being a lorpus, we can now use premise (2): everything that is luminous or wooden or a lorpus is a gorpus. Since Max is a lorpus, he must also be a gorpus.\n- Finally, we have established that Max is a lorpus, which directly satisfies the proof obligation (8) that Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(2),(3),(6)->(8)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus then Taylor is a visionary.
