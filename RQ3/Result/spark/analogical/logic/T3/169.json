Sam is not a lempus, Sam is a lorpus, and Sam is a gorpus.\n\nWe start by looking at the properties of Sam:\n- Premise (11) tells us that Sam is not a lempus, Sam is a lorpus, and Sam is a gorpus.\n- Premise (8) tells us that every lorpus is a zumpus, so since Sam is a lorpus, Sam is also a zumpus.\n- Premise (7) reiterates that Sam is a zumpus.\n- Premise (6) tells us that every zumpus is a lempus, but Premise (11) contradicts this directly by stating Sam is not a lempus. Therefore, we have a contradiction with Premise (6).\n\nNow, let's analyze the implications of Sam being a gorpus:\n- Premise (4) states that every gorpus is a brimpus, so since Sam is a gorpus, Sam is also a brimpus.\n- Premise (9) tells us that everything that is a vumpus or a wumpus or a grimpus is a brimpus. Since Sam is already established as a brimpus, this does not help in determining whether Sam is a vumpus or not.\n\nNext, let's analyze the implications of Sam being a rompus:\n- Premise (5) tells us that everything that is a vumpus or a wumpus or a grimpus is a rompus. Since Sam is a rompus (from Premise (11)), this does not help in determining whether Sam is a vumpus or not.\n\nFinally, let's analyze the implications of Sam being a yumpus:\n- Premise (2) tells us that everything that is a vumpus or an impus or a brimpus is a yumpus. Since Sam is already established as a yumpus (from Premise (10)), this does not help in determining whether Sam is a vumpus or not.\n\nGiven the above analysis, none of the premises directly address whether Sam is a vumpus or not. However, we know from Premise (11) that Sam is not a lempus, but every zumpus is supposed to be a lempus according to Premise (6), creating a contradiction.

Sam is not a lempus, Sam is a lorpus, and Sam is a gorpus.\n\nFrom Premise (12), we know:\n- Sam is not a lempus.\n- Sam is a lorpus.\n- Sam is a gorpus.\n\nFrom Premise (9), since Sam is a lorpus, it follows that Sam is also a zumpus.\n\nFrom Premise (8), since Sam is a zumpus, it follows that every zumpus is a lempus. However, this contradicts the fact that Sam is not a lempus (from Premise (12)). This contradiction implies there might be an error in the premises or our understanding of them.\n\nHowever, let's continue with the assumption that the premises are correct and try to derive the desired conclusion:\n\nFrom Premise (12), we also know that Sam is a gorpus.\n\nFrom Premise (5), since Sam is a gorpus, it follows that Sam is also a brimpus.\n\nFrom Premise (10), since Sam is a brimpus, it follows that Sam is also a shumpus, a rompus, and a lempus.\n\nFrom Premise (6), since Sam is a rompus, it follows that Sam is also a lempus. This again contradicts the fact that Sam is not a lempus (from Premise (12)).\n\nGiven these contradictions, we cannot proceed with the standard logical deduction. However, if we assume that the premise stating \"Every zumpus is a lempus\" (Premise 7) is incorrect or can be ignored due to the contradiction, then we can proceed as follows:\n\nSince Sam is a gorpus (from Premise (12)), and every gorpus is a brimpus (from Premise (5)), then Sam is a brimpus.\n\nSince Sam is a brimpus, and everything that is a vumpus or a wumpus or a grimpus is a brimpus (from Premise (10)), this does not directly tell us whether Sam is a vumpus or not.\n\nHowever, from Premise (1), if Sam is not a vumpus, then Taylor is a visionary. We need to determine whether Sam is a vumpus or not.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we cannot definitively conclude whether Sam is a vumpus or not due to the contradictions in the premises. Therefore, we cannot directly prove that Taylor is a visionary based on the given premises without resolving the contradictions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(1),(5),(12)->(13)"}]
