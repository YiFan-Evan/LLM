From (6) and (10), since Max is an impus and also a yumpus and lempus, he must be a vumpus.\n4. From (8) and knowing Max is a vumpus, we can deduce that Max is either a dumpus, numpus, or vumpus. Since being a vumpus is already established, this doesn't help in determining whether Max is a numpus.\n5. From (7), every wumpus is a grimpus. Since Max is a wumpus (from 3), Max is also a grimpus.\n6. From (4) and (5), anything that is a sterpus, numpus, or shumpus is both a grimpus and a brimpus.
