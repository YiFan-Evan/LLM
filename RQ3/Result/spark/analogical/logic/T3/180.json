According to premise (7), every rompus is a numpus. Therefore, Sally is a numpus.\n\nHowever, premise (12) states that Sally is not a numpus, which contradicts the conclusion derived from premise (7). This means there must be a mistake in our interpretation of the premises or the premises themselves contain a contradiction.\n\nLet's focus on the proof obligation (13) \"Sally is not an impus.\" To prove this, we can use premise (1), which states that everything that is a vumpus or an impus or a rompus is a tumpus. Since Sally is already established as a rompus (from premise (11)) and therefore a tumpus (by premise (1)), if Sally were also an impus, she would still be a tumpus, but this doesn't help us prove that she is not an impus directly.\n\nInstead, let's consider the implications of Sally being a brimpus (from premise (12)). According to premise (4), each brimpus is a lorpus. And according to premise (6), everything that is a lorpus or a shumpus or a grimpus is a vumpus. Therefore, Sally being a brimpus implies that she is also a lorpus and thus a vumpus.\n\nNow, if Sally were an impus, she would also be a tumpus (by premise (1)), but this doesn't provide a direct contradiction to any of the premises. However, the fact that Sally is not a numpus (premise (12)) while being a rompus (premise (11)) and thus a numpus (premise (7)) creates an inconsistency in the premises themselves.\n\nGiven this inconsistency, we cannot derive a logical conclusion about Sally's status as an impus solely based on the provided premises without resolving the contradiction. Therefore, the original problem cannot be solved as stated.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The problem cannot be solved as stated due to contradictory premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is not an impus then Taylor is a visionary.

Since Sally is a rompus, she is also a tumpus. However, being a tumpus does not directly tell us whether Sally is an impus or not.\n\nWe need to find a way to determine Sally's status as an impus. From premise (6), everything that is a sterpus, a zumpus, or an impus is a shumpus. If Sally were an impus, she would also be a shumpus. But being a shumpus alone does not make her an impus; it only means she could be one of sterpus, zumpus, or impus.\n\nSince we cannot directly determine whether Sally is an impus from the given premises without causing a contradiction, we cannot definitively prove that Taylor is a visionary based on the information provided.
