From premise (2), since everything that is a brimpus is a zumpus, we can infer that Max is a zumpus.\n3. From premise (6), we know that everything that is earthy or fruity or a vumpus is a numpus. This means if Max were earthy or fruity, he would be a numpus.\n\nSince we need to prove that Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus, and given the information from premises (12) and (2), there isn't enough direct information to link Max being a brimpus with him being earthy or fruity. However, we can use the fact that Max is a yumpus from premise (13).\n\n4. From premise (4), we know that everything that is wooden or luminous or a sterpus is a yumpus. Since Max is a yumpus, he could potentially be wooden, luminous, or a sterpus.\n5. From premise (10), we know that everything that is nervous, shy, or a yumpus is a vumpus. Since Max is a yumpus, he must also be a vumpus.\n\nNow, combining this with premise (6):\n6. Since everything that is earthy or fruity or a vumpus is a numpus, and we have established that Max is a vumpus, it follows that Max is a numpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot directly conclude that Max is earthy or fruity.
