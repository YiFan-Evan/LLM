Let's go step by step:\n\n1. From (9), we know Alex is a tumpus and a zumpus.\n2. From (5), since Alex is a zumpus, and all zumpuses are yumpuses and tumpuses, we can confirm that Alex is also a yumpus.\n3. From (6), since Alex is a yumpus, and all yumpuses are impuses and brimpuses, we can infer that Alex is also an impus and a brimpus.\n4. Therefore, we have successfully derived that Alex is a brimpus using the provided premises.\n\nNow, let's present three related but not identical problems along with their solutions:\n\n### Problem 1:\nPremises: [(1) Dogs are mammals and canines. (2) All cats are pets and felines. (3) Fido is a dog and a pet. (4) Rex is a cat and a pet.] Prove: (5) Rex is a feline.\n\n#### Solution:\n1. From (2), since Rex is a cat, and all cats are felines, we can infer that Rex is a feline.\nTherefore, (2) -> (5).\n\n### Problem 2:\nPremises: [(1) Birds are animals and have feathers. (2) Sparrows are birds. (3) Every robin is a bird and sings. (4) Blue jays are birds and blue.] Prove: (5) Sparrows have feathers.\n\n#### Solution:\n1. From (1), since sparrows are birds, and all birds have feathers, we can infer that sparrows have feathers.\nTherefore, (1), (2) -> (5).\n\n### Problem 3:\nPremises: [(1) Cars are vehicles and have wheels. (2) Every truck is a car and has a bed. (3) Sedans are cars and have four doors. (4) The vehicle parked outside is a sedan.] Prove: (5) The vehicle parked outside has wheels.\n\n#### Solution:\n1. From (4), the vehicle parked outside is a sedan.\n2. From (3), since it's a sedan, and all sedans are cars, it follows that the vehicle parked outside is a car.\n3. From (1), since it's a car, and all cars have wheels, we can infer that the vehicle parked outside has wheels.\nTherefore, (1), (3), (4) -> (5).\n\nNow, let's provide the answer to the original problem:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6), (7), (8), (9) -> (11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Alex is a brimpus then Taylor is a visionary.

Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. From (10) and (6), we know Alex is a tumpus and a zumpus, and from (6), we know that all yumpuses are impuses and brimpuses. Since Alex is a zumpus, which implies Alex can also be a yumpus (from the relationship in (6)), it follows that Alex is an impus and a brimpus.\n2. From (8), we know that each brimpus is a rompus and a numpus. Since we have already established that Alex is a brimpus, it follows that Alex is also a rompus and a numpus.\n3. From (9), we know that numpuses are grimpuses and sterpuses. Since Alex is a numpus, it follows that Alex is also a grimpus and a sterpus.\n4. From (11), we directly know that Alex is a grimpus and a sterpus. This reinforces the conclusion from step 3.\n5. From (7), we know that yumpuses are impuses and brimpuses. Since Alex is a yumpus (from step 1), it follows that Alex is an impus and a brimpus.\n6. Combining all the information, we have established that Alex is a brimpus.\n7.
