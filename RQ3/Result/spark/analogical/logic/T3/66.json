However, if we look at premise 3, we see that everything that is temperate or a gorpus is a rompus. Although it doesn't directly apply to Rex, it provides a connection between being a rompus and other characteristics.\n\nNow, let's try to connect the dots using the information we have:\n- From premise 6, we know Rex is a gorpus.\n- According to premise 3, everything that is temperate or a gorpus is a rompus. Since Rex is a gorpus, Rex must be a rompus.\n\nTherefore, we have proven that Rex is a rompus. Now, going back to premise 2:\n- Everything that is kind or a rompus is a brimpus. Since we've already proven Rex is a rompus, this means Rex must also be a brimpus.\n\nThus, we have successfully derived the proof obligation that Rex is kind or a rompus by showing that Rex is indeed a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(3),(7),(1)->(8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Rex is kind or a rompus then Taylor is a visionary.
