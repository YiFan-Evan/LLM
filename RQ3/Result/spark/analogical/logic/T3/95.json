Since Max is a wumpus, he must also be a grimpus.\n3. **Using Premise (8)**: Everything that is windy, rainy, or a gorpus is a dumpus. Since Max is a gorpus, he must also be a dumpus.\n4. **Using Premise (5)**: Everything that is cold, hot, or a lempus is a sterpus. This does not directly help us prove that Max is blue, orange, or a lempus.\n5. **Using Premise (7)**: Everything that is moderate, slow, or a tumpus is an impus.
