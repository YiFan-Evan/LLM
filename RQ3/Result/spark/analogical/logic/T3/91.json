From premise (12), Fae is a grimpus.\n2. From premise (5), everything that is transparent, opaque, or a grimpus is a zumpus. Since Fae is a grimpus, Fae is a zumpus.\n3. From premise (11), everything that is moderate, slow, or a vumpus is a jompus. To prove Fae is a yumpus, we need to show Fae fits into one of these categories.\n4. From premise (6), everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus. Therefore, if Fae were luminous or metallic or a yumpus, Fae would be a vumpus.\n5. Since Fae is a shumpus from premise (13), and everything that is sour or bitter or a shumpus is an impus (premise 8), Fae is an impus.\n6. Now, we need to connect the dots to show Fae being luminous or metallic or a yumpus.\n7. From premise (4), everything that is kind, angry, or a grimpus is a yumpus. Since Fae is a grimpus (from step 1), Fae is a yumpus.\n8. Since Fae is a yumpus (from step 7), and everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus (premise 6), Fae is a vumpus.\n9. Since Fae is a vumpus, and everything that is moderate, slow, or a vumpus is a jompus (premise 11), Fae is a jompus.\n10. Since Fae is a jompus and everything that is happy, shy, or a jompus is a tumpus (premise 7), Fae is a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, by combining all the relevant premises, we can conclude that Fae must be either luminous, metallic, or a yumpus to satisfy all conditions leading to Fae being a vumpus and ultimately proving the proof obligation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(12),(13)->(14)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
