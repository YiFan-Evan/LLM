Let's analyze each premise:\n\n- Premise 3 states: Everything that is spicy, bitter, sour, sweet, and a brimpus is a wumpus.\n- Premise 4 states: Everything that is nervous and shy and happy and feisty and a yumpus is a brimpus.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can see that if Sam satisfies the conditions in either of these premises, it will help us prove the proof obligation.\n\n#### Step-by-Step Derivation:\n1. **Premise 13**: Sam is a yumpus.\n   - This directly satisfies part of Premise 4.\n\n2. **Premise 14**: Sam is nervous.\n   - This also satisfies part of Premise 4.\n\n3. **Premise 15**: Sam is shy.\n   - This also satisfies part of Premise 4.\n\n4. **Premise 11**: Sam is happy.\n   - This also satisfies part of Premise 4.\n\n5. **Premise 16**: Sam is feisty.\n   - This also satisfies part of Premise 4.\n\nCombining Premise 13, 14, 15, 11, and 16 with Premise 4, we get:\n- Sam is nervous and shy and happy and feisty and a yumpus, so by Premise 4, Sam is a brimpus.\n\nNow, we need to show that Sam is spicy, bitter, sour, and sweet to satisfy Premise 3:\n- **Premise 6**: Sam is spicy.\n- **Premise 12**: Sam is bitter.\n- **Premise 18**: Sam is sour.\n- **Premise 8**: Sam is sweet.\n\nCombining all these, we have:\n- Sam is spicy, bitter, sour, sweet, and a brimpus.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe minimal set of premises required to prove (19) is:\n(3), (4), (6), (8), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (18) -> (19)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\n(3), (4), (6), (8), (12), (13), (14), (15), (16), (18)->(19)\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sam is spicy, bitter, sour, sweet, and a brimpus then Taylor is a visionary.

Therefore, by Premise 5, Sam is a brimpus.\n\nCombining all these, we have:\n- Sam is spicy, bitter, sour, sweet, and a brimpus.\n\nNow, using **Premise 1**:\n- Since Sam is spicy, bitter, sour, sweet, and a brimpus, it follows that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\nThe minimal set of premises required to prove (20) is:\n(1), (5), (7), (9), (13), (14), (15), (16), (12), (17), (19) -> (20)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\n(1), (5), (7), (9), (13), (14), (15), (16), (12), (17), (19)->(20)\n```"}]
