American dipper\n\nNow, let's perform the movements from the starting position (plate rack):\n\n- You start at the plate rack (position 10).\n- Move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction: \\(10 + 15 = 25\\)\n  Since there are only 20 dots, we need to find the equivalent position within the range of 1 to 20: \\(25 - 20 = 5\\). This means you end up at position 5, which is the tench.\n- Move around the ring by 14 steps in a clockwise direction: \\(5 + 14 = 19\\). This means you end up at position 19, which is the typewriter keyboard.\n- Move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction: \\(19 + 8 = 27\\). Again, we reduce this number within the range of 1 to 20: \\(27 - 20 = 7\\). This means you end up at position 7, which is the paper towel.\n- Move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction: Since moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving clockwise with the remaining steps to complete a full circle, we calculate \\(20 - 3 = 17\\). This means you end up at position 17, which is the rifle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: rifle."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
