We then determine the position of the shoe store and apply the given movements to find the final item.\n\n1. Numbering the items:\n- Poke bonnet (start)\n- Husky\n- Cheeseburger\n- Goose\n- Mitten\n- Bloodhound\n- Desktop computer\n- Toy Poodle\n- Boa constrictor\n- Dust jacket\n- Honeycomb\n- Damselfly\n- Shoe store\n- Hartebeest\n- Bulbul\n- Water buffalo\n- Freight car\n- Semi-trailer truck\n- St. Bernard\n- Pirate ship\n\n2. Identifying the position of the shoe store:\nThe shoe store is the 13th item on the path.\n\n3. Applying the movements:\n   - Move counter-clockwise by 19 steps from the shoe store (13 - 19 = -6). Since we can't have a negative position, we add 20 to -6 to get 14. So, after moving 19 steps counter-clockwise, you are at the 14th item, which is the water buffalo.\n   - Move clockwise by 10 steps from the water buffalo (14 + 10 = 24). Since 24 exceeds the total number of items, we subtract 20 from 24 to get 4. So, after moving 10 steps clockwise, you are at the 4th item, which is the cheeseburger.\n   - Move clockwise by 9 steps from the cheeseburger (4 + 9 = 13).
