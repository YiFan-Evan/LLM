Since moving counter-clockwise decreases the position number, we subtract 3 from the starting position:\n\n\\( 1 - 3 = -2 \\)\n\nSince we are on a circular path with 20 elements, we need to adjust for negative numbers by adding 20 until we get a positive number within the range of 1 to 20:\n\n\\( -2 + 20 = 18 \\)\n\nSo, after moving 3 steps counter-clockwise, you land on the basketball (position 18).\n\nNext, you move 16 steps in a clockwise direction from the basketball. Moving clockwise increases the position number, so we add 16 to the current position:\n\n\\( 18 + 16 = 34 \\)\n\nAgain, we adjust for positions greater than 20 by subtracting 20 until we get a number within the range of 1 to 20:\n\n\\( 34 - 20 = 14 \\)\n\nSo, after moving 16 steps clockwise from the basketball, you land on the abaya (position 14).\n\nFinally, you move 7 steps in a clockwise direction from the abaya.
