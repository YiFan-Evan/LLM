To find the position after wrapping, we use 31 - 20 = 11. So, item 11 is the church.\n3. Now, move 6 steps counter-clockwise from the church (item 11): 11 - 6 = 5. So, item 5 is the Australian Silky Terrier.\n4. Finally, move 17 steps clockwise from the Australian Silky Terrier (item 5): 5 + 17 = 22, and again we need to wrap around: 22 - 20 = 2.
