You start at the golf ball located at the top of the map.\n\n2. **Identifying the Positions**: Starting from the golf ball at position 1 (top of the map), the items are placed as follows in a clockwise direction:\n   - Golf Ball (position 1)\n   - Flamingo (position 2)\n   - Bow Tie (position 3)\n   - Crate (position 4)\n   - Lotion (position 5)\n   - Border Terrier (position 6)\n   - Old English Sheepdog (position 7)\n   - Granny Smith (position 8)\n   - Pirate Ship (position 9)\n   - Electric Locomotive (position 10)\n   - Airliner (position 11)\n   - Brass (position 12)\n   - Alpine Ibex (position 13)\n   - Trimaran (position 14)\n   - Dome (position 15)\n   - Otter (position 16)\n   - Ant (position 17)\n   - Jacamar (position 18)\n   - Chambered Nautilus (position 19)\n   - Backpack (position 20)\n\n3. **Calculating Movements**: Let's calculate the positions after each move step by step.\n\n   - **Movement 1**: Move counter-clockwise by 8 steps. Since moving counter-clockwise means going backwards on the circle, subtract 8 from your starting position 1.\n     \\( 1 - 8 = -7 \\). Adding 20 to make it within the range of 1 to 20: \\( -7 + 20 = 13 \\). This means you end up at the Alpine Ibex.\n\n   - **Movement 2**: Move clockwise by 5 steps. From the current position 13, add 5.\n     \\( 13 + 5 = 18 \\). This means you end up at the Jacamar.\n\n   - **Movement 3**: Move clockwise by 16 steps. From the current position 18, add 16.\n     \\( 18 + 16 = 34 \\). Since 34 is more than 20, subtract 20 to get the correct position: \\( 34 - 20 = 14 \\). This means you end up at the Trimaran.\n\n   - **Movement 4**: Move counter-clockwise by 14 steps. From the current position 14, subtract 14.\n     \\( 14 - 14 = 0 \\). Adding 20 to make it within the range of 1 to 20: \\( 0 + 20 = 20 \\).
