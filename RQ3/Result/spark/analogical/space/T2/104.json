Schooner\n\nNow, starting from the badger (which is at position 7), if you move 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, we count backwards:\n- 1 step counter-clockwise from badger (position 7) is fox squirrel (position 9).\n- 2 steps counter-clockwise from badger (position 7) is schooner (position 10).\n\nNext, if you move 2 steps in a clockwise direction from the badger:\n- 1 step clockwise from badger (position 7) is plunger (position 8).\n- 2 steps clockwise from badger (position 7) is altar (position 6).\n\nTherefore, after moving 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the badger, you find a schooner.
