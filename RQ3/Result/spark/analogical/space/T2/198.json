This is because 20 steps counter-clockwise from any dot brings you back to the same dot (since \\(20 \\div 20 = 1\\), which is an integer).\n\n### Conclusion:\nYou will find yourself back at the clothes iron after moving 20 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **clothes iron**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
