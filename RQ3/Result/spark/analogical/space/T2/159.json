Starting from the European garden spider, you move 11 steps counter-clockwise and then 11 steps clockwise. We need to determine which item you will find after these movements.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the starting point:**\n   - The European garden spider is at position 16 (since we start counting from 1).\n\n2. **Movement in the counter-clockwise direction:**\n   - Moving 11 steps counter-clockwise from the European garden spider means moving backwards by 11 positions.\n   - Since the path is circular, if we move more than half the total number of dots (which is 10 for a 20-dot path), it wraps around.\n   - To find the effective position after moving 11 steps counter-clockwise:\n     \\[\n     16 - 11 = 5\n     \\]\n   - Position 5 corresponds to the traffic light.\n\n3. **Movement in the clockwise direction:**\n   - Now, moving 11 steps clockwise from the traffic light:\n   - Since the path is circular, moving more than half the total number of dots (which is 10 for a 20-dot path) also wraps around.\n   - To find the effective position after moving 11 steps clockwise from the traffic light:\n     \\[\n     5 + 11 = 16\n     \\]\n   - Position 16 corresponds to the European garden spider.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: European garden spider."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
