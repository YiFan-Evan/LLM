Starting from the wok, moving 8 steps in a clockwise direction:\n   - The elements are: dumbbell, scabbard, toilet paper, wooden spoon, schooner, American lobster, St. Bernard, stone wall, lionfish, tray, hot pot, planetarium, suit, tank, front curtain, entertainment center, maze, harvester, goldfinch.\n\n2. From the new position (harvester), moving 4 steps in a clockwise direction:\n   - The elements are: goldfinch, dumbbell, scabbard, toilet paper.\n\n3. From the new position (toilet paper), moving 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction:\n   - Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we need to count backwards from the current position:\n     - Current position is at index 4 (toilet paper).\n     - Move 6 steps back: 4 - 6 = -2. Since we cannot have a negative index, we wrap around the circle: -2 + 20 = 18.\n   - The element at index 18 is an entertainment center.\n\n4. From the new position (entertainment center), moving 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction:\n   - Again, counting backwards:\n     - Current position is at index 18 (entertainment center).\n     - Move 10 steps back: 18 - 10 = 8.\n   - The element at index 8 is a schooner.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: schooner."}]
