Since there are 20 positions in total, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise will bring us back to the same position as the soap dispenser.\n\nTherefore, after moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from the soap dispenser, you will still be at the soap dispenser.\n\nThus, the final answer is: \\(\\text{soap dispenser}\\)."}]
