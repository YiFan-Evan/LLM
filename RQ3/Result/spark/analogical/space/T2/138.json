Since we are on a circular path, we add 20 to make it positive: \\(20 - 6 = 14\\). So, the first stop is at position 14.\n   - Move clockwise by 16 steps from position 14: \\(14 + 16 = 30\\). Again, since it's a circular path, we take modulo 20: \\(30 \\mod 20 = 10\\). So, the second stop is at position 10.\n   - Move counter-clockwise by 7 steps from position 10: \\(10 - 7 = 3\\). So, the third stop is at position 3.\n   - Move counter-clockwise by 13 steps from position 3: \\(3 - 13 = -10\\). Adding 20 again to make it positive: \\(20 - 10 = 10\\).
