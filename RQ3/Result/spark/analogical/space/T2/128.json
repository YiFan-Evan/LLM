The sequence will be:\n     1. Lhasa Apso\n     2. Rain barrel\n     3. Through arch bridge\n     4. Flamingo\n     5. Golf cart\n     6. Chest\n     7. Sussex Spaniel\n     8. Drum\n     9.

Since the path is circular and has 20 dots, we need to adjust for negative values by adding 20 until we get a positive number within the range of 1 to 20. \\( -8 + 20 = 12 \\). You land on the Military aircraft.\n   - Now move 10 steps clockwise from dot 12: \\( 12 + 10 = 22 \\). Again, adjust for the circular path: \\( 22 - 20 = 2 \\).
