Let's number the dots from 1 to 20, with dot 1 being where you start and find a sleeping bag.\n\n1. Start at the dugong (which is on dot 14).\n2. Move counter-clockwise by 8 steps: \\(14 - 8 = 6\\) (since moving counter-clockwise reduces the dot number).\n3. Move counter-clockwise by 2 more steps: \\(6 - 2 = 4\\).\n4. Move clockwise by 5 steps: \\(4 + 5 = 9\\) (since moving clockwise increases the dot number).\n5. Move clockwise by 16 steps: \\(9 + 16 = 25\\). Since there are only 20 dots, we need to find the position equivalent to dot 25 in a circle of 20 dots. We do this by taking modulo 20: \\(25 \\mod 20 = 5\\).\n\nSo, after all these movements, you will be at dot 5.
