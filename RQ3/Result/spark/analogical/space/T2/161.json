Next, move in a clockwise direction by 19 steps.\n4. Finally, move in a clockwise direction by 17 steps.\n\nFirst, convert all movements to a single direction for simplicity. Since moving counter-clockwise by 1 step is equivalent to moving clockwise by 19 steps (because there are 20 dots, so 20 - 1 = 19), we can restate our moves as:\n   - Move clockwise by 19 steps.\n   - Move clockwise by 6 steps.\n   - Move clockwise by 19 steps.\n   - Move clockwise by 17 steps.\n\nNow, add up these steps:\n\\[ 19 + 6 + 19 + 17 = 61 \\]\n\nSince the circular path has only 20 dots, we need to find the remainder when dividing by 20:\n\\[ 61 \\mod 20 = 1 \\]\n\nThis means you will end up at the dot immediately after the starting point (Staffordshire Bull Terrier), which is the Border Collie.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Border Collie."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
