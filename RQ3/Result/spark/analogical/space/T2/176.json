Since there are 20 items, we can number them from 1 to 20 in a clockwise direction starting with the moving van at position 1.\n\nThe football helmet is located at position 2 (since it is the next item after the moving van).\n\nNow, let's perform the given steps:\n\n1. Move counter-clockwise by 15 steps from the football helmet:\n   - Starting at position 2, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 15 from 2. Since moving counter-clockwise decreases the position number, and because we want to stay within the range of 1 to 20, we add 20 to the result if it's less than 1 (to complete the circle):\n   - New position = (2 - 15 + 20) % 20 = (7) % 20 = 7\n   - The item at position 7 is a milk can.\n\n2. Move counter-clockwise by 8 steps from the current position (position 7):\n   - New position = (7 - 8 + 20) % 20 = (9) % 20 = 9\n   - The item at position 9 is a house finch.\n\n3. Move counter-clockwise by 20 steps from the current position (position 9):\n   - New position = (9 - 20 + 20) % 20 = (-1 + 20) % 20 = 19\n   - The item at position 19 is a proboscis monkey.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: proboscis monkey."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
