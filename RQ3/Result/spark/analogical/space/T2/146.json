According to the information provided, there are 20 items on the path.\n\nNow, let's analyze the movements step by step:\n1. Starting from the oxygen mask, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction.\n2. Then, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n3. After that, you move around the ring by 17 steps in a clockwise direction.\n4. Finally, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nLet's calculate each movement:\n1. Moving clockwise by 8 steps from the oxygen mask (initial position):\n   - The oxygen mask is the starting point (position 0), so after 8 steps, you will be at position 8 (since we start counting from 0).\n2. Moving counter-clockwise by 6 steps from position 8:\n   - Moving counter-clockwise means going backwards. From position 8, moving back by 6 steps, you will land at position 8 - 6 = 2.\n3. Moving clockwise by 17 steps from position 2:\n   - From position 2, moving forward by 17 steps, you will land at position 2 + 17 = 19 (we use modulo 20 since it's a circular path).\n4. Moving counter-clockwise by 7 steps from position 19:\n   - From position 19, moving back by 7 steps, you will land at position 19 - 7 = 12.\n\nPosition 12 corresponds to the item located at the 12th dot on the circular path.

Moving counter-clockwise by 8 steps from the Appenzeller Sennenhund (initial position):\n   - The Appenzeller Sennenhund is at position 14 (since we start counting from 0), so after 8 steps backward, you will be at position 14 - 8 = 6 (using modulo 20 for circular paths).\n2. Moving clockwise by 6 steps from position 6:\n   - From position 6, moving forward by 6 steps, you will land at position 6 + 6 = 12.\n3. Moving counter-clockwise by 17 steps from position 12:\n   - From position 12, moving back by 17 steps, you will land at position 12 - 17 = -5. Since we need a positive index, we add 20 to get 15 (12 - 17 + 20 = 15).\n4. Moving clockwise by 7 steps from position 15:\n   - From position 15, moving forward by 7 steps, you will land at position 15 + 7 = 22.
