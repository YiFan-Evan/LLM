Kingsnake\n20. Malinois\n\nStarting from the knee pad (position 3), we move in the following steps:\n\n1. Move counter-clockwise by 2 steps from the knee pad. This means moving backwards two positions:\n   - Position 3 -> Position 1 -> Position 20 -> Position 19 (Malinois)\n\n2. Move counter-clockwise by 14 steps from the current position (position 19):\n   - Position 19 -> Position 18 -> Position 17 -> Position 16 -> Position 15 -> Position 14 -> Position 13 -> Position 12 -> Position 11 -> Position 10 -> Position 9 -> Position 8 -> Position 7 -> Position 6 -> Position 5 -> Position 4 -> Position 3 (Knee pad)\n\n3.

Move counter-clockwise by 5 steps from the current position (position 16):\n   - Again, counter-clockwise movement is calculated as 20 - 5 = 15 steps forward:\n   - Position 16 -> Position 17 -> Position 18 -> Position 19 -> Position 20 -> Position 1 -> Position 2 -> Position 3 -> Position 4 -> Position 5 -> Position 6 -> Position 7 -> Position 8 -> Position 9 (Power drill) -> Position 10 (Mortar) -> Position 11 (Stinkhorn mushroom) -> Position 12 (Velvet) -> Position 13 (Papillon) -> Position 14 (Sealyham Terrier) -> Position 15 (Toy terrier)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Toy terrier."}]
