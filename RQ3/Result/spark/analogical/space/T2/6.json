At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a four-poster bed. Moving in a clockwise direction from the four-poster bed, the elements on the path are a French horn, a perfume, a strainer, and a ruffed grouse. Starting from the four-poster bed, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution to Problem 1:**\nStarting from the four-poster bed (position 0), moving 2 steps counter-clockwise means going left twice. The positions would be:\n- Step 1: Position 4 (ruffed grouse)\n- Step 2: Position 3 (strainer)\n\nTherefore, after 2 steps counter-clockwise, you will find a **strainer**.\n\n### Problem 2\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a four-poster bed. Moving in a clockwise direction from the four-poster bed, the elements on the path are a French horn, a perfume, a strainer, and a ruffed grouse. Starting from the four-poster bed, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution to Problem 2:**\nStarting from the four-poster bed (position 0), moving 4 steps clockwise means going right four times. Since there are only 5 positions, moving 4 steps brings you back to the starting point.\n\nTherefore, after 4 steps clockwise, you will find a **four-poster bed**.\n\n### Problem 3\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a four-poster bed. Moving in a clockwise direction from the four-poster bed, the elements on the path are a French horn, a perfume, a strainer, and a ruffed grouse. Starting from the four-poster bed, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution to Problem 3:**\nStarting from the four-poster bed (position 0), moving 6 steps clockwise means going right six times. Since there are only 5 positions, moving 6 steps brings you to:\n- Step 1: Position 1 (French horn)\n- Step 2: Position 2 (perfume)\n- Step 3: Position 3 (strainer)\n- Step 4: Position 4 (ruffed grouse)\n- Step 5: Position 0 (four-poster bed)\n- Step 6: Position 1 (French horn)\n\nTherefore, after 6 steps clockwise, you will find a **French horn**.\n\n### Answer to the Original Problem\nStarting from the four-poster bed (position 0), moving around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction and then by 3 steps in a clockwise direction can be summarized as follows:\n1. After 2 steps counter-clockwise from position 0, you reach position 3 (strainer).\n2. From position 3, moving 3 steps clockwise means going right three times:\n   - Step 1: Position 4 (ruffed grouse)\n   - Step 2: Position 0 (four-poster bed)\n   - Step 3: Position 1 (French horn)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **French horn**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
