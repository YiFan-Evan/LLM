Moving clockwise means we add the number of steps to the current dot number:\n\n7 + 6 = 13\n\nSince there are only 10 dots, we need to find the equivalent position within the 10 dots. We do this by taking the remainder of 13 when divided by 10:\n\n13 % 10 = 3\n\nSo, after moving 6 steps clockwise from the beaver, you land on the Mexican hairless dog. Next, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Mexican hairless dog:\n\n3 - 5 = -2\n\nSince we can't have a negative dot number, we need to adjust this by adding 10 to get a positive equivalent within the range of 1 to 10:\n\n-2 + 10 = 8\n\nThis lands you on the black stork. Finally, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction:\n\n8 - 1 = 7\n\nThis lands you back on the beaver.
