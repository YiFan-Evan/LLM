At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a baseball player. Moving in a clockwise direction from the baseball player, the elements on the path are a porcupine, an umbrella, a CD player, a red fox, an airliner, a bramble, a piggy bank, a tripod, and a passenger car. Starting from the umbrella, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at the umbrella.\n- Move 5 steps clockwise: umbrella (start), CD player (1), red fox (2), airliner (3), bramble (4), piggy bank (5).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **piggy bank**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a baseball player. Moving in a clockwise direction from the baseball player, the elements on the path are a porcupine, an umbrella, a CD player, a red fox, an airliner, a bramble, a piggy bank, a tripod, and a passenger car. Starting from the umbrella, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counterclockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n- Start at the umbrella.\n- Move 3 steps counterclockwise: umbrella (start), baseball player (1), porcupine (2), CD player (3).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **CD player**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a baseball player. Moving in a clockwise direction from the baseball player, the elements on the path are a porcupine, an umbrella, a CD player, a red fox, an airliner, a bramble, a piggy bank, a tripod, and a passenger car.
