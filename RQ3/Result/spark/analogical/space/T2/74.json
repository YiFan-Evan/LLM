We start by assigning numbers to each position on the circular map:\n\n1 (Hyena)\n2 (Hammer)\n3 (Christmas Stocking)\n4 (Welsh Springer Spaniel)\n5 (Pill bottle)\n6 (Titi)\n7 (Snail)\n8 (Paddle wheel)\n9 (Gossamer-winged Butterfly)\n10 (Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier)\n\nNow, let's follow your movements step by step from the Christmas stocking (position 3):\n\n1. You move counter-clockwise by 5 steps from the Christmas stocking.\n   Counter-clockwise movement means we subtract 5 from the current position (3). This gives us position \\( 3 - 5 = -2 \\). Since the path is circular and consists of 10 dots, we add 10 to \\(-2\\) to get the equivalent positive position: \\( -2 + 10 = 8 \\).\n   So, after this move, you are at position 8, where there is a Paddle wheel.\n\n2. Next, you move clockwise by 1 step from the Paddle wheel.\n   Clockwise movement means we add 1 to the current position (8). This gives us position \\( 8 + 1 = 9 \\).\n   So, after this move, you are at position 9, where there is a Gossamer-winged Butterfly.\n\n3. Finally, you move clockwise by 8 steps from the Gossamer-winged Butterfly.\n   Again, adding 8 to the current position (9) gives us \\( 9 + 8 = 17 \\).
