We will assign this as position 1 for simplicity. Moving clockwise from the hard disk drive, the next item is an acoustic guitar, which would be at position 2, and so on until we reach the African bush elephant, which is at position 9.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the counter-clockwise movement.**\nWhen moving counter-clockwise, the direction is opposite to the initial clockwise arrangement. Therefore, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the African bush elephant (position 9) means we are effectively moving 14 steps clockwise (since 20 - 6 = 14).\n\n**Step 3: Move 14 steps clockwise from position 9.**\nStarting from position 9 (African bush elephant), moving 14 steps clockwise takes us to position 22. However, since there are only 20 positions, we need to find the equivalent position within the range of 1 to 20. To do this, we take the remainder when dividing by 20:\n\\[ 22 \\mod 20 = 2 \\]\nSo, after moving 14 steps clockwise from position 9, we arrive at position 2.\n\n**Step 4: Move an additional 14 steps counter-clockwise from position 2.**\nFrom position 2, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise means moving 6 steps clockwise (since 20 - 14 = 6):\n\\[ 2 + 6 = 8 \\]\nTherefore, after moving an additional 14 steps counter-clockwise from position 2, we end up at position 8.\n\n**Step 5: Identify the item at position 8.**\nLooking back at our list, the item at position 8 is a badger.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: badger."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
