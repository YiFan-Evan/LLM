Since moving counter-clockwise decreases the dot numbers, we subtract 5 from 5: \\(5 - 5 = 0\\). However, since the dots are circular and numbered from 1 to 10, when we reach 0, we wrap around to the last dot, which is the Angora rabbit on dot 10.\n3. Next, you move 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction from the Angora rabbit. Subtracting 1 from 10 gives us \\(10 - 1 = 9\\), which is the Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\n4. Finally, you move 10 steps in a clockwise direction from the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. Adding 10 to 9 gives us \\(9 + 10 = 19\\). Since the path is circular with only 10 dots, we need to find the remainder when 19 is divided by 10: \\(19 \\mod 10 = 9\\).
