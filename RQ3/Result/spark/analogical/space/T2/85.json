At position 6, you find the Ostrich.\n\n### Step 2: Move by 9 steps from the Ostrich (position 6)\n- From position 6, moving 9 steps clockwise means going back 1 step (since \\(10 - 9 = 1\\)).\n- So, you land at position \\(6 + 1 = 7\\). At position 7, you find the Fiddler crab.\n\n### Step 3: Move by 2 steps from the Fiddler crab (position 7)\n- From position 7, moving 2 steps clockwise means going forward 2 steps.\n- So, you land at position \\(7 + 2 = 9\\).
