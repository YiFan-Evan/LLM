Starting from the prairie grouse (Dot 10), move around the ring by 16 steps in a clockwise direction:\n   - 16 steps from Dot 10 brings us to Dot 4 (since \\(10 + 16 = 26\\) and \\(26 - 20 = 6\\), but since we wrap around after reaching 20, it becomes \\(6 - 2 = 4\\))\n   - At Dot 4, we find the **wing**.\n\n2. Move around the ring by 17 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the wing:\n   - Moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving clockwise in the opposite direction.

Move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the swimming cap:\n   - Again, moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving clockwise in the opposite direction. So, 5 steps clockwise from Dot 1 would bring us to Dot 6 (since \\(1 + 5 = 6\\))\n   - At Dot 6, we find the **scuba diver**.\n\n4. Move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the scuba diver:\n   - Similarly, moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving clockwise in the opposite direction.
