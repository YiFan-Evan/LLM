At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a great egret. Moving in a clockwise direction from the great egret, the elements on the path are a kit fox, a Standard Schnauzer, a Curly-coated Retriever, a smooth green snake, a spoonbill, a monitor, a common squirrel monkey, a Basset Hound, and a bell pepper. Starting from the great egret, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nStarting from the great egret (position 1):\n1. Move 3 steps in a clockwise direction:\n   - Position 1 to position 2: Kit Fox\n   - Position 2 to position 3: Standard Schnauzer\n   - Position 3 to position 4: Curly-coated Retriever\n2. Move 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction:\n   - Position 4 to position 3: Standard Schnauzer\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Standard Schnauzer.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
