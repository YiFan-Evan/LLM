Therefore, if you start at the moving van and move 1 step in a clockwise direction, you will be on the football helmet.\n\n2. **First movement (15 steps counter-clockwise):** From the football helmet, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise means you need to count backwards from the football helmet's position by 15 dots. Remember, since it's a circular path with 20 dots, counting backwards 15 dots from the football helmet (which is dot number 2) will take us to dot number 17 (since 2 - 15 = -13, and adding 20 to -13 gives us 7). Dot number 17 corresponds to the maraca.\n\n3. **Second movement (8 steps counter-clockwise):** Now, starting from the maraca (dot number 17), moving 8 steps counter-clockwise means counting backwards 8 dots from dot number 17. This takes us to dot number 9 (since 17 - 8 = 9). Dot number 9 corresponds to the yurt.\n\n4. **Third movement (20 steps counter-clockwise):** Finally, starting from the yurt (dot number 9), moving 20 steps counter-clockwise means counting backwards 20 dots from dot number 9. This takes us to dot number 19 (since 9 - 20 = -11, and adding 20 to -11 gives us 9).
