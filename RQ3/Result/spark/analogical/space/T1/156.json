Starting from the drilling rig (position 1), you move counter-clockwise by 7 steps. Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 7 from the current position: \\(1 - 7 = -6\\). To find the equivalent positive position on a circular path of 20 elements, we add 20 to the result: \\(-6 + 20 = 14\\). The element at position 14 is the tank.\n2.
