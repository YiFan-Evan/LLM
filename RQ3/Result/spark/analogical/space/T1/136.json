The starting point is at the golf ball, and we move in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions as specified. We will use positive numbers for counter-clockwise steps and negative numbers for clockwise steps relative to the current position.\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1. Starting from the golf ball (position 0).\n2. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise. Since the path is circular and has 20 dots, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise means effectively moving \\(20 - 8 = 12\\) steps clockwise.\n3. From the new position, move 5 steps clockwise.\n4. From the new position, move 16 steps clockwise.\n5. From the new position, move 14 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nLet's calculate each step:\n\n### Step 1:\n- Start at position 0 (golf ball).\n\n### Step 2:\n- Move 8 steps counter-clockwise. This is equivalent to moving 12 steps clockwise because \\(20 - 8 = 12\\).\n- New position: \\(0 + 12 = 12\\).\n\n### Step 3:\n- Move 5 steps clockwise from position 12.\n- New position: \\(12 + 5 = 17\\).\n\n### Step 4:\n- Move 16 steps clockwise from position 17.\n- New position: \\(17 + 16 = 33\\). Since there are only 20 dots, we need to find the effective position within the range of 0-19 by taking modulo 20: \\(33 \\mod 20 = 13\\).\n\n### Step 5:\n- Move 14 steps counter-clockwise from position 13. This is equivalent to moving 6 steps clockwise because \\(20 - 14 = 6\\).\n- New position: \\(13 + 6 = 19\\).\n\nTherefore, after completing all these movements, you will be at position 19 on the circular path.\n\nNow, let's identify the item at position 19:\n\nThe items on the path are listed in order as follows:\n1. Golf ball\n2. Flamingo\n3. Bow tie\n4. Crate\n5. Lotion\n6. Border Terrier\n7. Old English Sheepdog\n8. Granny Smith\n9. Pirate ship\n10. Electric locomotive\n11. Airliner\n12. Brass\n13. Alpine ibex\n14. Trimaran\n15. Dome\n16. Otter\n17. Ant\n18. Jacamar\n19. Chambered nautilus\n20.
