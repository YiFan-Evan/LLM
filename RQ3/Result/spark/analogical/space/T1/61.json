Moving clockwise, the positions would be:\n\n1. Drum\n2. Tow truck\n3. Polaroid camera\n4. Gordon Setter\n5. Lipstick\n6. Green mamba\n7. King Charles Spaniel\n8. Electric locomotive\n9. Mashed potato\n10. Sweatshirt\n\n### Step 2: Determine Movement\nYou are starting at the Gordon Setter, which is in position 4. Moving 10 steps counter-clockwise means you go back 10 positions. Since there are only 10 positions on the circle, moving back 10 positions will take you back to the original position.\n\n### Step 3: Find the Final Position\nSince you start at position 4 (Gordon Setter) and move back 10 steps counter-clockwise, you will end up back at position 4.
