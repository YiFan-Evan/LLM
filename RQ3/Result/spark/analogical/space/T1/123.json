Move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the snail (index 17):\n   Counter-clockwise means we subtract the number of steps from the current index. If the result is negative, we add the total number of items (20) to wrap around the circle.\n   17 - 5 = 12 (No need to wrap around; within bounds)\n\n2. Move 11 steps counter-clockwise from index 12:\n   12 - 11 = 1 (Again, no need to wrap around)\n\n3.
