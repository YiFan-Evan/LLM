From position 18, moving back 10 steps takes you to position 8 (18 - 10 = 8). At position 8, you will find a badger.\n\n### Step 3: Move Clockwise by 16 Steps\nFrom position 8, moving clockwise by 16 steps takes you to position 4 (8 + 16 = 24; 24 % 20 = 4). At position 4, you will find an agama.\n\n### Step 4: Move Counter-Clockwise by 11 Steps\nFrom position 4, moving counter-clockwise by 11 steps takes you to position 13 (4 - 11 = -7; adding 20 to wrap around the circle gives us 20 - 7 = 13). At position 13, you will find an English Setter.\n\n### Step 5: Move Counter-Clockwise by 2 Steps\nFrom position 13, moving counter-clockwise by 2 steps takes you to position 11 (13 - 2 = 11).
