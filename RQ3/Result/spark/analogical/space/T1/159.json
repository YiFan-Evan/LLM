Starting from a chest at the top of the path, the items in a clockwise direction are as follows: plectrum, knee pad, American bullfrog, fly, necklace, church, killer whale, agama, shoji, English Springer Spaniel, traffic light, thimble, spindle, pelican, European garden spider, shopping cart, black-footed ferret, green iguana, oxygen mask. You start at the European garden spider, move 11 steps counter-clockwise, then move 11 steps clockwise. What item will you find?\n\n### Step-by-step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify Starting Point**:\n   - The starting point is the European garden spider.\n\n2. **Movement Calculation**:\n   - First, move 11 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Then, move 11 steps clockwise.\n\n3. **Determine Position After Each Movement**:\n   \n   - **Counter-Clockwise Movement**:\n     - From the European garden spider (position 15), moving 11 steps counter-clockwise means moving backwards.\n     - To find the new position, subtract 11 from the current position: \\( 15 - 11 = 4 \\).\n     - The item at position 4 is the necklace.\n\n   - **Clockwise Movement**:\n     - Now, from the necklace (position 4), move 11 steps clockwise.\n     - Since we are moving clockwise, add 11 to the current position: \\( 4 + 11 = 15 \\) (remembering that after reaching the end of the circle, we loop back to the start).\n     - The modulo operation helps here: \\( (4 + 11) \\% 20 = 15 \\).\n     - Therefore, the final position is again the European garden spider.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter performing both movements, you end up back at the European garden spider.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: European garden spider."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
