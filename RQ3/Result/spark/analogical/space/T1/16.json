What do you find?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nStarting at the wild boar, moving 3 steps clockwise would take you to:\n1. Wild boar -> Trombone (1st step)\n2. Trombone -> Hot dog (2nd step)\n3. Hot dog -> Necklace (3rd step)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Necklace**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou are positioned on the bell pepper, and you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the wild boar.
