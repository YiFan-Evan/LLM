From position 20, moving 3 steps clockwise: \\(20 + 3 = 23\\)\n   - Since there are only 20 positions, subtract 20 from 23: \\(23 - 20 = 3\\)\n   - Therefore, after 3 moves, you land at position 3, which is a Jacamar.\n\n2. Next, move an additional 13 steps in a clockwise direction from position 3:\n   - \\(3 + 13 = 16\\)\n   - After moving 13 steps from position 3, you land at position 16, which is a School bus.\n\n3. Finally, move another 20 steps in a clockwise direction from position 16:\n   - \\(16 + 20 = 36\\)\n   - Again, subtract 20 from 36: \\(36 - 20 = 16\\)\n   - Therefore, after moving 20 steps from position 16, you still land at position 16, which is again a School bus.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Final Answer\nAfter applying all the moves, you end up at the School bus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **School bus**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
