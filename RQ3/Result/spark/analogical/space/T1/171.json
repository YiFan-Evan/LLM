Starting from the cloak (at position 1), the items are:\n1. Cloak\n2. Barrel\n3. Medicine Chest\n4. Longhorn Beetle\n5. Red Wolf\n6. Wok\n7. Minibus\n8. Hummingbird\n9. Siamang\n10.

From position 20 (flagpole), moving 2 steps clockwise lands you on:\n\\[ 20 + 2 = 22 \\]\nWrapping around to the beginning:\n\\[ 22 - 20 = 2 \\]\nSo, the item at position 2 is the barrel.\n\n### Step 4: Third Movement - 13 Steps Counter-Clockwise\nFrom position 2 (barrel), moving 13 steps counter-clockwise lands you on:\n\\[ 2 - 13 = -11 \\]\nWrapping around to the end:\n\\[ -11 + 20 = 9 \\]\nSo, the item at position 9 is the siamang.\n\n### Step 5: Fourth Movement - 17 Steps Clockwise\nFrom position 9 (siamang), moving 17 steps clockwise lands you on:\n\\[ 9 + 17 = 26 \\]\nWrapping around to the beginning:\n\\[ 26 - 20 = 6 \\]\nSo, the item at position 6 is the wok.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **wok**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
