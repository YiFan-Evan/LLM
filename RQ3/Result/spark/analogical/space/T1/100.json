What will you find?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nStarting from the European green lizard, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means going left on the circular path:\n1. European green lizard\n2. Cucumber\n3. Wool\n\nTherefore, after moving 3 steps counter-clockwise, you find wool.\n\n### Problem 2:\nFrom your current position (which is wool), you move 1 step in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution 2:**\nFrom the wool, moving 1 step clockwise means going right on the circular path:\n1. Wool\n2. Ice cream\n\nTherefore, after moving 1 step clockwise from the wool, you find ice cream.\n\n### Problem 3:\nFrom your current position (which is ice cream), you move 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution 3:**\nFrom the ice cream, moving 8 steps clockwise means going right on the circular path:\n1. Ice cream\n2. Spindle\n3. Binoculars\n4. Cliff dwelling\n5.
