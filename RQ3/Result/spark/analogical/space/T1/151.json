Move 18 steps counter-clockwise from the current position.\n4. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise from the current position.\n\nFirst, let's identify the positions of each item on the circular path starting from the sunglass at position 1:\n\n1. Sunglass\n2.

Three-toed sloth\n15. Teapot\n16. Hermit crab\n17. Chainsaw\n18. Chain\n19. Great white shark\n20. Komodo dragon\n\nNow, let's perform the steps:\n\n- Start at the umbrella (position 6).\n- Move 1 step clockwise from position 6 to position 7 (Doormat).\n- Move 1 step counter-clockwise from position 7 back to position 6 (Umbrella).\n- Move 18 steps counter-clockwise from position 6: Since moving 18 steps counter-clockwise from position 6 means going backward, we count down from 6: 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 20 -> 19 -> ... until reaching position 6 after counting down 18 steps. The final position is 19 (Great white shark).\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise from position 19: Counting down from 19 by 2 steps gives us position 17 (Chainsaw).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nChainsaw"}]
