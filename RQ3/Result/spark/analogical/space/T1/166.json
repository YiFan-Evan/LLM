If it exceeds 20, wrap around by subtracting 20.  \n   From position 1, add 19: \\( 1 + 19 = 20 \\).  \n   Since the path has only 20 positions, position 20 loops back to position 1 (Electric Ray).\n\n3. **Move counter-clockwise by 13 steps**:  \n   From position 1, subtract 13: \\( 1 - 13 = -12 \\).  \n   To adjust for negative position, add 20: \\( -12 + 20 = 8 \\).  \n   So, you are now at position 8 (Convertible).\n\n4. **Move clockwise by 9 steps**:  \n   From position 8, add 9: \\( 8 + 9 = 17 \\).  \n   So, you are now at position 17 (Dowitcher).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Dowitcher**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
