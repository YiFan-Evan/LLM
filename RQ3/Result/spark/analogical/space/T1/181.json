Moving counter-clockwise means we subtract the number of steps from the current position. So, 16 - 6 = 10.

Since there are only 20 dots, and moving past the last dot takes you back to the first one, you land on the jackfruit.\n\nThen, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Again, moving counter-clockwise means we subtract the number of steps from the current position. So, 20 - 9 = 11.
