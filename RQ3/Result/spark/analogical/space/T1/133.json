Moving in a clockwise direction from the Black and Tan Coonhound, the elements on the path are a ladle, a submarine, a warthog, an American coot, a consomme, a strawberry, a beaker, a hen-of-the-woods, a spider web, an odometer, a coral reef, a wok, a jigsaw puzzle, a pirate ship, a ring-tailed lemur, a mushroom, a pot pie, a yellow garden spider, and a knee pad. Starting from the beaker, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution to Problem 1:**\nStarting from the beaker (8th dot) and moving counter-clockwise by 5 steps:\n\\[ 8 - 5 = 3 \\]\nThe element on the 3rd dot is a ladle.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Starting from the beaker, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution to Problem 2:**\nStarting from the beaker (8th dot) and moving counter-clockwise by 9 steps:\n\\[ 8 - 9 = -1 \\]\nSince we are on a circular path with 20 dots, we need to add 20 to negative numbers to get the correct position:\n\\[ -1 + 20 = 19 \\]\nThe element on the 19th dot is a knee pad.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a Black and Tan Coonhound. Moving in a clockwise direction from the Black and Tan Coonhound, the elements on the path are a ladle, a submarine, a warthog, an American coot, a consomme, a strawberry, a beaker, a hen-of-the-woods, a spider web, an odometer, a coral reef, a wok, a jigsaw puzzle, a pirate ship, a ring-tailed lemur, a mushroom, a pot pie, a yellow garden spider, and a knee pad. Starting from the beaker, you move around the ring by 13 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution to Problem 3:**\nStarting from the beaker (8th dot) and moving counter-clockwise by 13 steps:\n\\[ 8 - 13 = -5 \\]\nSince we are on a circular path with 20 dots, we need to add 20 to negative numbers to get the correct position:\n\\[ -5 + 20 = 15 \\]\nThe element on the 15th dot is a pirate ship.\n\n### Original Problem:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
