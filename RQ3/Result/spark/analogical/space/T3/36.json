Since there are only 5 elements on the path and you're moving in a circle, we can use modulo arithmetic to determine the final position. Specifically, the position after \\( n \\) steps is given by:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final position} = (\\text{Starting position} + n) \\mod 5 \\]\n\nHere, the starting position of the black swan is 4 (since it's the 4th element).\n\nSo, we calculate:\n\n\\[ \\text{Final position} = (4 + 10) \\mod 5 = 14 \\mod 5 = 4 \\]\n\nThis means that after moving 10 steps in a clockwise direction from the black swan, you will end up at the same position as the black swan itself. Therefore, the item you find is:\n\n**Black swan**."}]
