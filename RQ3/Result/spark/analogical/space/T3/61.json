Drum\n     2. Tow Truck\n     3. Polaroid Camera\n     4. Gordon Setter\n     5. Lipstick\n     6. Green Mamba\n     7. King Charles Spaniel\n     8. Electric Locomotive\n     9.

Since there are only 10 elements, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise will take you back to your starting point. This is because moving 10 steps around a circle of 10 elements completes one full cycle.\n\n4. **Identify the Final Position:**\n   - Starting from position 4 (Gordon Setter), moving 10 steps counter-clockwise brings you back to position 4.\n\n### Conclusion:\nAfter moving 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Gordon Setter, you end up back at the Gordon Setter.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Gordon Setter."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
