Let's start by identifying the initial positions and movements:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Tent (position 2)\n2. **First Movement**: 4 steps counter-clockwise\n3. **Second Movement**: 10 steps clockwise\n4. **Third Movement**: 18 steps clockwise\n5. **Fourth Movement**: 16 steps counter-clockwise\n\nWe will calculate the final position step by step.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation:\n\n1. **Starting from the tent (position 2)**:\n   - Move 4 steps counter-clockwise:\n     \\[\n     2 - 4 = -2 \\quad (\\text{Since it's a circular path, we add 20 to get a positive index})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -2 + 20 = 18\n     \\]\n     So, the new position is 18 (Rugby ball).\n\n2. **From position 18**:\n   - Move 10 steps clockwise:\n     \\[\n     18 + 10 = 28 \\quad (\\text{Again, since it's a circular path, we take modulo 20})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     28 \\mod 20 = 8\n     \\]\n     So, the new position is 8 (Horizontal bar).\n\n3. **From position 8**:\n   - Move 18 steps clockwise:\n     \\[\n     8 + 18 = 26 \\quad (\\text{Take modulo 20})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     26 \\mod 20 = 6\n     \\]\n     So, the new position is 6 (Canoe).\n\n4. **From position 6**:\n   - Move 16 steps counter-clockwise:\n     \\[\n     6 - 16 = -10 \\quad (\\text{Add 20 to get a positive index})\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     -10 + 20 = 10\n     \\]\n     So, the new position is 10 (Printer).\n\nTherefore, after all the movements, you will find a **printer**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{printer}}\n\\]"}]
