Now, let's move according to the instructions:\n\n1. Move 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 7 from 20:\n   20 - 7 = 13\n   This lands you at the Stupa (item 13).\n\n2. Move 16 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the current position (Stupa, item 13):\n   13 - 16 = -3\n   Since we are on a circular path with 20 items, if the result is negative, we add 20 to wrap around:\n   -3 + 20 = 17\n   This lands you at the Ping-Pong Ball (item 17).\n\n3. Move 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction from the current position (Ping-Pong Ball, item 17):\n   17 - 1 = 16\n   This lands you at the Quilt (item 16).\n\n4.
