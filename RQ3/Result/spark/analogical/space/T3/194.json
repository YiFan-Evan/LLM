Move counter-clockwise by 15 steps from dot 16:\n   Counter-clockwise means we subtract the steps from the current position (16 - 15 = 1). So, you land on the breakwater (dot 1).\n   \n2. Move clockwise by 16 steps from dot 1:\n   Since you are already on dot 1, moving clockwise by 16 steps takes you to dot 17 (1 + 16 = 17). You find a T-shirt here.\n   \n3. Move clockwise by 9 steps from dot 17:\n   Starting from dot 17, moving clockwise by 9 steps takes you to dot 4 (17 + 9 = 26; 26 - 20 = 6; since it's circular and exceeded 20, we subtract 20).

Move counter-clockwise by 30 steps from dot 16:\n   Counter-clockwise means we subtract the steps from the current position (16 - 30 = -14). Since the path is circular and we can't have a negative position, we add 20 to get back into the positive range (-14 + 20 = 6). So, you land on dot 6. You find a scorpion here.\n   \n2.
