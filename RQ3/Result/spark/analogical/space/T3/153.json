We start by identifying its position. Let's assign numbers from 0 to 19 to each dot, starting with 0 at the top where the poke bonnet is found. Moving clockwise from the poke bonnet, the positions are assigned as follows:\n   - Poke bonnet: 0\n   - Husky: 1\n   - Cheeseburger: 2\n   - Goose: 3\n   - Mitten: 4\n   - Bloodhound: 5\n   - Desktop computer: 6\n   - Toy Poodle: 7\n   - Boa constrictor: 8\n   - Dust jacket: 9\n   - Honeycomb: 10\n   - Damselfly: 11\n   - Shoe store: 12\n   - Hartebeest: 13\n   - Bulbul: 14\n   - Water buffalo: 15\n   - Freight car: 16\n   - Semi-trailer truck: 17\n   - St. Bernard: 18\n   - Pirate ship: 19\n\n2. **Calculate the counter-clockwise move**: Starting from the shoe store (position 12), moving 19 steps in a counter-clockwise direction means we need to subtract 19 from 12.
