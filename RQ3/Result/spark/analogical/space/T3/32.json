Through arch bridge\n2. Mail bag\n3. Lotion\n4. Little blue heron\n5. King Charles Spaniel\n\nNow, starting from the little blue heron and moving 10 steps counter-clockwise, we need to determine where we end up. Since there are only 5 elements in the circle, taking more than 5 steps means we will loop around the circle multiple times. To find the position after 10 steps, we can calculate the remainder when 10 is divided by 5:\n\n$$ 10 \\div 5 = 2 \\text{ remainder } 0 $$\n\nThis tells us that after completing two full loops around the circle (which brings us back to the starting point), we take 0 additional steps. Therefore, we end up at the same position as the starting point, which is the **little blue heron**."}]
