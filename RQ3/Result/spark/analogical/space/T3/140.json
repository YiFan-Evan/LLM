Let's number them from 0 to 19 for simplicity.\n\n2. **Find the Starting Point (Arctic Fox):**\n   - Dutch oven (0), cowboy hat (1), Australian Terrier (2), goldfinch (3), Arctic fox (4), milk can (5), mask (6), revolver (7), Standard Schnauzer (8), pillow (9), Dobermann (10), cliff dwelling (11), frying pan (12), valley (13), eggnog (14), Windsor tie (15), night snake (16), gazelle (17), ice pop (18), marmot (19).\n\n3. **Calculate the Final Position after Movements:**\n   - Start at the Arctic fox (position 4).\n   - Move 9 steps in a clockwise direction.\n   - Move 4 steps in a clockwise direction.\n   - Move 16 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n### Step-by-Step Calculation\n1. **First Movement:**\n   - Start at position 4 (Arctic fox).\n   - Move 9 steps: \\( 4 + 9 = 13 \\) (since it's a circular path, wrap around if necessary).\n   - Position 13 corresponds to eggnog.\n\n2. **Second Movement:**\n   - Start at position 13 (eggnog).\n   - Move 4 steps: \\( 13 + 4 = 17 \\) (again, wrap around if necessary).\n   - Position 17 corresponds to gazelle.\n\n3. **Third Movement:**\n   - Start at position 17 (gazelle).\n   - Move 16 steps: \\( 17 + 16 = 33 \\) (wrap around since it exceeds 20).\n   - To find the actual position, calculate \\( 33 - 20 = 13 \\) (remaining steps).\n   - Position 13 corresponds to eggnog again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **eggnog**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
