Since there are 20 items in total, we can number them from 1 to 20. Let's assign the marmoset as position 1 (the top of the path).\n\n2. **Numbering the items**: We will count from the marmoset (position 1) clockwise around the circle to find the positions of each item:\n   - Marmoset: Position 1\n   - Ladle: Position 2\n   - Persian cat: Position 3\n   - Cauliflower: Position 4\n   - Ballpoint pen: Position 5\n   - Cairn Terrier: Position 6\n   - Chainsaw: Position 7\n   - Mailbox: Position 8\n   - Ear: Position 9\n   - Palace: Position 10\n   - Yellow garden spider: Position 11\n   - Newt: Position 12\n   - Indri: Position 13\n   - Coral fungus: Position 14\n   - Four-poster bed: Position 15\n   - Picket fence: Position 16\n   - Guacamole: Position 17\n   - Snail: Position 18\n   - Pickelhaube: Position 19\n   - Quill: Position 20\n\n3. **Movements**:\n   - Starting from the snail, which is at position 18, you move counter-clockwise by 5 steps.\n   - Then, you move another 11 steps counter-clockwise from the new position.\n   - Finally, you move an additional 4 steps counter-clockwise.\n\n4. **Calculating the final position**:\n   - After the first movement (5 steps counter-clockwise from position 18): \\(18 - 5 = 13\\).

You land at the Ladle.\n   - After the third movement (4 steps counter-clockwise from position 2): \\(2 - 4 = -2\\).
