Brass\n  - 2. Newt\n  - 3. Sloth bear\n  - 4. Sealyham Terrier\n  - 5. Kimono\n  - 6. Alaskan Malamute\n  - 7. Axolotl\n  - 8. Tray\n  - 9. Loggerhead sea turtle\n  - 10. Bluetick Coonhound\n\nSo after 7 steps clockwise from brass, you end up at the Bluetick Coonhound.\n\n#### Second Movement (3 steps counter-clockwise):\n- From Bluetick Coonhound, moving counter-clockwise:\n  - 1. Bluetick Coonhound\n  - 2. Tray\n  - 3. Axolotl\n  - 4. Alaskan Malamute\n  - 5. Kimono\n  - 6. Sealyham Terrier\n  - 7. Sloth bear\n\nSo after 3 steps counter-clockwise from Bluetick Coonhound, you end up at the Sloth bear.\n\n#### Third Movement (4 steps clockwise):\n- From Sloth bear, moving clockwise:\n  - 1. Sloth bear\n  - 2. Sealyham Terrier\n  - 3. Kimono\n  - 4. Alaskan Malamute\n  - 5. Axolotl\n  - 6. Tray\n  - 7. Bluetick Coonhound\n  - 8. Loggerhead sea turtle\n  - 9. Newt\n  - 10.
