From tights (position 3), move 4 steps in a clockwise direction. After 4 steps, you land on position 7, which is \"chiton\".\n3. From chiton (position 7), move 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Moving counter-clockwise means going backwards. Since you cannot go below 1, you have to wrap around the circle.
