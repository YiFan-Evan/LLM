Move 2 steps clockwise from the salt shaker. This means moving from item 5 to item 7 (Palace).\n3. Move another 2 steps clockwise from the palace. This means moving from item 7 to item 9 (Packet).\n4. Move 18 steps counter-clockwise from the packet. Since moving counter-clockwise 18 steps is equivalent to moving clockwise 2 steps (because 18 % 10 = 2), you end up at item 11, which wraps around to item 1 (Paper knife).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: paper knife."}]
