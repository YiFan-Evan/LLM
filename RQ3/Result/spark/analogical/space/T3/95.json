At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a rapeseed. Moving in a clockwise direction from the rapeseed, the elements on the path are a gas mask, a palace, a police van, a hard disk drive, a green iguana, a Great Dane, a spiny lobster, a cauliflower, and a tricycle. Starting from the police van, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution to Problem 1:**\nFrom the police van, moving 6 steps clockwise, we count the items:\n1. Hard disk drive (1)\n2. Green iguana (2)\n3. Great Dane (3)\n4. Spiny lobster (4)\n5. Cauliflower (5)\n6. Tricycle (6)\n\nTherefore, after 6 steps, you find the tricycle.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a rapeseed. Moving in a clockwise direction from the rapeseed, the elements on the path are a gas mask, a palace, a police van, a hard disk drive, a green iguana, a Great Dane, a spiny lobster, a cauliflower, and a tricycle. Starting from the police van, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution to Problem 2:**\nFrom the police van, moving 4 steps clockwise, we count the items:\n1. Hard disk drive (1)\n2. Green iguana (2)\n3. Great Dane (3)\n4. Spiny lobster (4)\n\nTherefore, after 4 steps, you find the spiny lobster.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a rapeseed. Moving in a clockwise direction from the rapeseed, the elements on the path are a gas mask, a palace, a police van, a hard disk drive, a green iguana, a Great Dane, a spiny lobster, a cauliflower, and a tricycle. Starting from the police van, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution to Problem 3:**\nFrom the police van, moving 1 step clockwise, we count the item:\n1. Hard disk drive (1)\n\nTherefore, after 1 step, you find the hard disk drive.\n\n### Original Problem:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
