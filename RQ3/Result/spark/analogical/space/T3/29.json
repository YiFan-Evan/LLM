Gossamer-winged butterfly (starting point)\n2. Goblet\n3. Volcano\n4. Tiger\n5. Weasel\n\nStarting from the tiger, you move counter-clockwise by 8 steps and then another 6 steps. Since the path has only 5 elements, we need to account for looping back around the circle.\n\nFirst, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger:\n- 1 step counter-clockwise from the tiger takes you to the gossamer-winged butterfly.\n- 2 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger takes you to the goblet.\n- 3 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger takes you to the volcano.\n- 4 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger takes you to the gossamer-winged butterfly again.\n- 5 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger takes you to the goblet again.\n- 6 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger takes you to the volcano again.\n- 7 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger takes you to the gossamer-winged butterfly again.\n- 8 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger takes you to the goblet.\n\nNext, moving 6 more steps counter-clockwise from the goblet:\n- 1 step counter-clockwise from the goblet takes you to the volcano.\n- 2 steps counter-clockwise from the goblet takes you to the gossamer-winged butterfly.\n- 3 steps counter-clockwise from the goblet takes you to the goblet (completes one full circle).\n- 4 steps counter-clockwise from the goblet takes you to the volcano.\n- 5 steps counter-clockwise from the goblet takes you to the gossamer-winged butterfly.\n- 6 steps counter-clockwise from the goblet takes you to the goblet (completes another full circle).\n\nTherefore, after moving 8 + 6 = 14 steps in total counter-clockwise from the tiger, you end up at the goblet.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: goblet."}]
