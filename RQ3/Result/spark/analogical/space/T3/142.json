Starting from the top of the path where you find a harvester, move 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nSince the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise means moving \\(20 - 8 = 12\\) steps clockwise from the starting point.\nThe items on the path from the start (harvester) are: half-track, drilling rig, Australian Kelpie, American coot, weighing scale, bell-cot, bulbul, otter, eastern diamondback rattlesnake, microwave oven, mashed potato, tile roof, proboscis monkey, trimaran, balloon, cowboy boot, cougar, throne, paper knife.\n\nCounting 12 steps clockwise from the start (harvester):\n1. half-track\n2. drilling rig\n3. Australian Kelpie\n4. American coot\n5. weighing scale\n6. bell-cot\n7. bulbul\n8. otter\n9. eastern diamondback rattlesnake\n10. microwave oven\n11. mashed potato\n12. tile roof\n\nSo, after 12 steps clockwise from the harvester, you find the **tile roof**.\n\n### Problem 2:\nContinuing from where you left off (tile roof), move 12 steps in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the tile roof, moving 12 steps clockwise:\n1. proboscis monkey\n2. trimaran\n3. balloon\n4. cowboy boot\n5. cougar\n6. throne\n7. paper knife\n8. harvester\n9. half-track\n10. drilling rig\n11. Australian Kelpie\n12. American coot\n\nAfter 12 steps clockwise from the tile roof, you find the **American coot**.\n\n### Problem 3:\nContinuing from where you left off (American coot), move 17 steps in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting from the American coot, moving 17 steps clockwise:\n1. weighing scale\n2. bell-cot\n3. bulbul\n4. otter\n5. eastern diamondback rattlesnake\n6. microwave oven\n7. mashed potato\n8. tile roof\n9. proboscis monkey\n10. trimaran\n11. balloon\n12. cowboy boot\n13. cougar\n14. throne\n15. paper knife\n16. harvester\n17. half-track\n18. drilling rig\n19. Australian Kelpie\n20. American coot (and back to the start)\n\nAfter 17 steps clockwise from the American coot, you find the **drilling rig**.\n\n### Problem 4:\nContinuing from where you left off (drilling rig), move 13 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nMoving 13 steps counter-clockwise from the drilling rig means moving \\(20 - 13 = 7\\) steps clockwise from the drilling rig:\n1. Australian Kelpie\n2. American coot\n3. weighing scale\n4. bell-cot\n5. bulbul\n6. otter\n7. eastern diamondback rattlesnake\n\nAfter 7 steps clockwise from the drilling rig, you find the **eastern diamondback rattlesnake**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **eastern diamondback rattlesnake**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nMoving 26 steps counter-clockwise from the eastern diamondback rattlesnake means moving \\(20 - 26 = -6\\) steps clockwise from the starting point (eastern diamondback rattlesnake).\nThe items on the path from the eastern diamondback rattlesnake are: microwave oven, mashed potato, tile roof, proboscis monkey, trimaran, balloon, cowboy boot, cougar, throne, paper knife, harvester, half-track, drilling rig, Australian Kelpie, American coot, weighing scale, bell-cot, bulbul, otter.\n\nCounting 6 steps clockwise from the eastern diamondback rattlesnake:\n1. microwave oven\n2. mashed potato\n3. tile roof\n4. proboscis monkey\n5. trimaran\n\nSo, after 6 steps clockwise from the eastern diamondback rattlesnake, you find the **tile roof**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **tile roof**."}]
