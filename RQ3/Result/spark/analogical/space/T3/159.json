Fly\n6. Necklace\n7. Church\n8. Killer Whale\n9. Agama\n10. Shoji\n11. English Springer Spaniel\n12. Traffic Light\n13. Thimble\n14. Spindle\n15. Pelican\n16. European Garden Spider\n17.

The items are listed in a clockwise direction starting from the chest:\n\n1. Chest\n2. Plectrum\n3. Knee Pad\n4. American Bullfrog\n5. Fly\n6. Necklace\n7. Church\n8. Killer Whale\n9. Agama\n10.

Oxygen Mask\n\nThe European garden spider is at position 16.\n\n#### Step 2: Move 22 Steps Counter-Clockwise\nMoving 22 steps counter-clockwise from position 16:\n- Start at position 16 (European Garden Spider).\n- Subtract 22 from 16: \\( 16 - 22 = -6 \\)\n\nSince we are on a circular path with 20 dots, we need to adjust for the negative result:\n\\[ -6 \\mod 20 = 14 \\]\nThus, moving 22 steps counter-clockwise from position 16 brings us to position 14, which is the **Spindle**.\n\n#### Step 3: Move 22 Steps Clockwise\nNext, we move 22 steps clockwise from position 14 (Spindle):\n- Add 22 to 14: \\( 14 + 22 = 36 \\)\n\nAgain, adjusting for the circular path:\n\\[ 36 \\mod 20 = 16 \\]\nThus, moving 22 steps clockwise from position 14 brings us back to position 16, which is the **European Garden Spider**.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, after moving 22 steps counter-clockwise and then 22 steps clockwise from the European garden spider, you will find the **European Garden Spider**."}]
