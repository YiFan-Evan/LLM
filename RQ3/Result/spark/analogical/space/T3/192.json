You move around the ring by 12 steps in a clockwise direction: \\(13 + 12 = 25\\). Since there are only 20 dots, we find the position by taking the remainder of 25 divided by 20: \\(25 \\mod 20 = 5\\). So you end up at dot 5, where you will find the desk.\n2. You then move around the ring by 18 steps in a clockwise direction: \\(5 + 18 = 23\\). Again, taking the remainder: \\(23 \\mod 20 = 3\\). So you end up at dot 3, where you will find the jeans.\n3. Next, you move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction: \\(3 - 14 = -11\\). Adding 20 to make it positive and within the range of the circle: \\(20 - 11 = 9\\). So you end up at dot 9, where you will find the Miniature Poodle.\n4. Finally, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction: \\(9 - 15 = -6\\). Adding 20 to make it positive and within the range of the circle: \\(20 - 6 = 14\\).
