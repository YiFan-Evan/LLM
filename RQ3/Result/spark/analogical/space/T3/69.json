Microwave oven (starting point)\n2. American coot\n3. Japanese Chin\n4. Bell-cot\n5. Trolleybus\n6. Green iguana\n7. Bulletproof vest\n8. Golf ball\n9. Screwdriver\n10. Maze\n\nYou start at the golf ball and move 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting at the golf ball (item 8), moving 2 steps in a clockwise direction takes you to item 10 (Maze).\n\n### Problem 2:\nFollowing the same initial setup as Problem 1, you start at the golf ball again but move 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What do you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nStarting at the golf ball (item 8), moving 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction takes you to item 6 (Green iguana).\n\n### Problem 3:\nCombining both movements from Problems 1 and 2, you start at the golf ball, move 2 steps in a clockwise direction, and then move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\nFrom the golf ball (item 8), moving 2 steps in a clockwise direction leads to the Maze (item 10). From there, moving 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction takes you back to the Golf ball (item 8).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Golf ball**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
