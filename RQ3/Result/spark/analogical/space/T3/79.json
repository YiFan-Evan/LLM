Move 6 steps counter-clockwise.\n2. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nSince moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving clockwise with the remaining steps in the circle:\n- For a 10-dot circular path, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving \\(10 - 6 = 4\\) steps clockwise.\n- Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving \\(10 - 7 = 3\\) steps clockwise.\n\nSo, the net movement counter-clockwise is:\n\\[ 4 + 3 = 7 \\text{ steps clockwise} \\]\n\n#### Step 3: Net Movement\nThe total effective movement is the sum of the clockwise and counter-clockwise movements:\n\\[ 9 \\text{ steps clockwise} + 7 \\text{ steps clockwise} = 16 \\text{ steps} \\]\n\nSince the path is circular with 10 dots, we need to find the position after moving 16 steps on a 10-dot path. We do this by taking the remainder when dividing the total steps by the number of dots:\n\\[ 16 \\mod 10 = 6 \\]\n\nThis means that after moving 16 steps, you will end up at the 6th dot from the starting position.\n\n#### Identifying the Item on Dot 6:\nStarting from the common gallinule (dot 1), the elements are placed as follows:\n1.
