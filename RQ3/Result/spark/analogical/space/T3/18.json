At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find an umbrella. Moving in a clockwise direction from the umbrella, the elements on the path are a teddy bear, a bicycle, a cactus, a laptop, and a guitar. Starting from the cactus, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Identify the starting point: Umbrella at the top.\n2. Determine the elements in order: Umbrella, teddy bear, bicycle, cactus, laptop, guitar.\n3. Locate the cactus: Third element in the sequence.\n4. Move 3 steps from the cactus: Cactus \u2192 Laptop \u2192 Guitar \u2192 Teddy Bear.\n\n**Answer:** Teddy bear.\n\n### Problem 2:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 7 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a starfish. Moving in a clockwise direction from the starfish, the elements on the path are a candle, a snowman, a kite, a drum, a skateboard, and a robot. Starting from the drum, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Identify the starting point: Starfish at the top.\n2. Determine the elements in order: Starfish, candle, snowman, kite, drum, skateboard, robot.\n3. Locate the drum: Fifth element in the sequence.\n4. Move 4 steps from the drum: Drum \u2192 Skateboard \u2192 Robot \u2192 Starfish \u2192 Candle.\n\n**Answer:** Candle.\n\n### Problem 3:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 8 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a diamond ring. Moving in a clockwise direction from the diamond ring, the elements on the path are a camera, a surfboard, a lighthouse, a violin, a chessboard, a hot air balloon, and a compass. Starting from the lighthouse, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Identify the starting point: Diamond ring at the top.\n2. Determine the elements in order: Diamond ring, camera, surfboard, lighthouse, violin, chessboard, hot air balloon, compass.\n3. Locate the lighthouse: Fourth element in the sequence.\n4. Move 6 steps from the lighthouse: Lighthouse \u2192 Violin \u2192 Chessboard \u2192 Hot air balloon \u2192 Compass \u2192 Diamond ring \u2192 Camera.\n\n**Answer:** Camera.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: albatross."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
