What will you find?\n\n**Solution**:\nStarting from the odometer, moving 2 steps in a clockwise direction:\n   - First step: Redbone Coonhound\n   - Second step: cannon\n\nTherefore, you find the cannon.\n\n#### Problem 2:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a Redbone Coonhound. Moving in a clockwise direction from the Redbone Coonhound, the elements on the path are a cannon, a waffle iron, a tricycle, and an odometer. Starting from the odometer, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution**:\nStarting from the odometer, moving 4 steps in a clockwise direction:\n   - First step: Redbone Coonhound\n   - Second step: cannon\n   - Third step: waffle iron\n   - Fourth step: tricycle\n\nTherefore, you find the tricycle.\n\n#### Problem 3:\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots. At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a Redbone Coonhound. Moving in a clockwise direction from the Redbone Coonhound, the elements on the path are a cannon, a waffle iron, a tricycle, and an odometer. Starting from the odometer, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction.
