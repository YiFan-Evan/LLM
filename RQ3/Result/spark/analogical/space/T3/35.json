Since the path is circular and consists of only 5 dots, we can use modulo arithmetic to determine the correct position.\n\nWe know that moving 10 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(10 \\mod 5 = 0\\) steps counter-clockwise because every 5 steps will bring us back to the same position.\n\nTherefore, after 10 steps counter-clockwise from the Carolina anole, we will find ourselves back at the Carolina anole.\n\nThe final answer is: Carolina anole."}]
