Now, from the pencil case, you move 5 steps in a clockwise direction.\n   - From the pencil case, moving 5 steps clockwise leads to the snail.\n\n3. Finally, from the snail, you move 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n   - Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the snail means moving 4 steps clockwise (since 10 - 6 = 4).\n   - From the snail, moving 4 steps clockwise leads to the Chow Chow.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Chow Chow."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.

Now, from the chain-link fence, you move 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n   - Since moving around the ring by 10 steps brings us back to the same starting point (as the total number of dots is 10), we end up at the chain-link fence again.\n\n3.
