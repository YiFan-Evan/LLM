Since there are 20 dots, moving 13 steps clockwise from position 1 brings you to position \\(1 + 13 = 14\\). The item at position 14 is a howler monkey.\n   - From the howler monkey, move 7 more steps clockwise. This brings you to position \\(14 + 7 = 21\\). However, since the circle is only 20 dots, we subtract 20 from 21 to find the correct position within the circle: \\(21 - 20 = 1\\). This returns us to the padlock.\n\n3. **Counter-clockwise Movements**:\n   - Move 19 steps counter-clockwise from the padlock. Moving counter-clockwise means going backwards in the circle, so \\(1 - 19 = -18\\). To find the correct position, add 20 to -18 and get \\(-18 + 20 = 2\\). The item at position 2 is a French Bulldog.\n   - From the French Bulldog, move 6 steps counter-clockwise. This brings you to position \\(2 - 6 = -4\\). Again, adding 20 to -4 gives \\(-4 + 20 = 16\\).
