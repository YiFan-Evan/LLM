This is because the path is circular and has only 20 elements.\n\n\\[ 28 \\mod 20 = 8 \\]\nSo, moving 28 steps brings you to the 8th element from the photocopier.\n\nCounting 8 elements from the photocopier, the elements are:\n- Photocopier\n- Military cap\n- White-headed capuchin\n- Eastern diamondback rattlesnake\n- Jackfruit\n- Monarch butterfly\n- Cowboy hat\n- Jaguar\n\nTherefore, moving 28 steps brings you to the \"Jaguar\".\n\n### Problem 2:\nNow, starting from the jaguar, you move around the ring by 12 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\n**Solution:**\nContinuing from the jaguar, we count another 12 elements:\n\nThe remaining elements from the jaguar are:\n- Jaguar\n- Vase\n- Bookcase\n- Gong\n- Abacus\n- Plow\n- Sunscreen\n- Ballpoint pen\n- Sports car\n- Cleaver\n- Honeycomb\n- Horizontal bar\n- Baboon\n- Photocopier\n- Military cap\n- White-headed capuchin\n- Eastern diamondback rattlesnake\n- Jackfruit\n\nTherefore, moving 12 steps from the jaguar brings you to the \"Ballpoint pen\".\n\n### Problem 3:\nTherefore, after starting from the photocopier, moving 28 steps clockwise, and then moving another 12 steps clockwise, what do you find?\n\n**Final Answer:**\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Ballpoint pen**."}]
