The item at position 19 is **Band-Aid**.\n- From the Band-Aid (position 19), move counter-clockwise by 19 steps. Moving counter-clockwise means subtracting, so \\( 19 - 19 = 0 \\). The item at position 0 is **Irish Terrier**.\n- From the Irish Terrier (position 0), move clockwise by 7 steps. \\( 0 + 7 = 7 \\). The item at position 7 is **ambulance**.\n- From the ambulance (position 7), move clockwise by 15 steps. \\( 7 + 15 = 22 \\). Since there are only 20 dots, we wrap around to \\( 22 - 20 = 2 \\).
