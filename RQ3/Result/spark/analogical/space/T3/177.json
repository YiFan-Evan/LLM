What will you find?\n\n#### Solution:\n1. Start at the minibus (position 16).\n2. Move 11 steps clockwise: \\( 16 + 11 = 27 \\). Since there are only 20 dots, wrap around using modulo operation: \\( 27 \\mod 20 = 7 \\). You land on the limpkin.\n3. Move 17 steps counter-clockwise: \\( 7 - 17 = -10 \\). Wrap around using modulo operation: \\( (-10 + 20) \\mod 20 = 10 \\). You land on the siamang.\n4. Move 4 steps clockwise: \\( 10 + 4 = 14 \\). You land on the unicycle.\n5. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: \\( 14 - 5 = 9 \\). You land on the ground beetle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **ground beetle**.\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2\nYou have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
