Start at sunscreen (position 20).\n2. Move 18 steps clockwise from position 20:\n    \\[\n    20 + 18 = 38\n    \\]\n    Since there are only 20 positions, we take modulo 20:\n    \\[\n    38 \\mod 20 = 18\n    \\]\n    So you end up at position 18, which is the sea cucumber.\n3. Move 9 steps clockwise from position 18:\n    \\[\n    18 + 9 = 27\n    \\]\n    Again, take modulo 20:\n    \\[\n    27 \\mod 20 = 7\n    \\]\n    Now you are at position 7, which is the dowitcher.\n4. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise from position 7:\n    To move counter-clockwise, subtract 14:\n    \\[\n    7 - 14 = -7\n    \\]\n    Since moving counter-clockwise means going backwards, add 20 to get back into a positive range:\n    \\[\n    -7 + 20 = 13\n    \\]\n    Now you are at position 13, which is the corkscrew.\n5. Move 13 steps clockwise from position 13:\n    \\[\n    13 + 13 = 26\n    \\]\n    Take modulo 20:\n    \\[\n    26 \\mod 20 = 6\n    \\]\n    Finally, you end up at position 6, which is the Italian Greyhound.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Italian Greyhound**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
