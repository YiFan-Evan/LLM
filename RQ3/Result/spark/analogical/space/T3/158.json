We start by numbering the dots from 1 to 20 in a clockwise direction starting with the mosquito net at dot 1.\n\nThe positions of each item are as follows:\n- Mosquito Net (start): Dot 1\n- Grasshopper: Dot 2\n- American Lobster: Dot 3\n- Tibetan Terrier: Dot 4\n- Crash Helmet: Dot 5\n- Slug: Dot 6\n- Duck: Dot 7\n- Norwich Terrier: Dot 8\n- Gas Pump: Dot 9\n- Jeans: Dot 10\n- White-headed Capuchin: Dot 11\n- Common Redshank: Dot 12\n- Italian Greyhound: Dot 13\n- Viaduct: Dot 14\n- Comic Book: Dot 15\n- Sea Slug: Dot 16\n- Ping-Pong Ball: Dot 17\n- Scoreboard: Dot 18\n- Leatherback Sea Turtle: Dot 19\n- Neck Brace: Dot 20\n\nNow, we follow your movements step by step:\n\n1. Start from the gas pump at dot 9.\n2. Move counter-clockwise by 19 steps. Since moving counter-clockwise reduces the dot number, we calculate the new position as \\( 9 - 19 = -10 \\). Adding 20 to adjust for the negative and circular nature gives us \\( -10 + 20 = 10 \\). You end up at the jeans on dot 10.\n3. Move clockwise by 15 steps from dot 10. This increases the dot number, so \\( 10 + 15 = 25 \\). Subtracting 20 to adjust for the circular nature gives us \\( 25 - 20 = 5 \\). You end up at the duck on dot 5.\n4. Move clockwise by 12 steps from dot 5. This increases the dot number, so \\( 5 + 12 = 17 \\). No adjustment is needed since it's within the range of 1 to 20. You end up at the scoreboard on dot 17.\n5. Move counter-clockwise by 5 steps from dot 17. This reduces the dot number, so \\( 17 - 5 = 12 \\). No adjustment is needed since it's within the range of 1 to 20.
