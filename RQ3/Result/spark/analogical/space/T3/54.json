So after 8 steps, you are at the barrette.\n3. Now move 16 steps in a clockwise direction from the barrette. Since moving 10 steps around the circle brings you back to your starting point, we can simplify this by finding the remainder of 16 divided by 10. The remainder is 6. Counting 6 steps from the barrette, we go from the barrette to the bell-cot (1), mosquito net (2), computer mouse (3), tailed frog (4), cardigan (5), and finally to the red wolf (6). So after 16 steps, you are at the red wolf.\n4. Finally, move 18 steps in a clockwise direction from the red wolf. Again, simplify by finding the remainder of 18 divided by 10. The remainder is 8. Counting 8 steps from the red wolf, we go from the red wolf to the military uniform (1), miniskirt (2), Briard (3), barrette (4), bell-cot (5), mosquito net (6), computer mouse (7), and tailed frog (8).
