Arctic fox\n\nThe Arctic fox is at position 6.\n\nNow, we need to determine the new position after moving 40 steps clockwise. Since the path is circular, every 20 steps will bring us back to the starting point. Therefore, we can find the effective number of steps by taking the modulo of 40 with respect to 20:\n\n\\[ 40 \\mod 20 = 0 \\]\n\nThis means that moving 40 steps is equivalent to moving 0 steps (i.e., we end up back at the starting point).\n\nTherefore, starting from the Arctic fox and moving 40 steps in a clockwise direction, we will still be at the Arctic fox.\n\nSo, the final answer is: $\\boxed{\\text{Arctic fox}}$."}]
