We start at the garter snake (top of the path) and move clockwise to find the following items:\n   - Garter snake\n   - Green mamba\n   - Stethoscope\n   - Tailed frog\n   - Tench\n   - Waste container\n   - Paper towel\n   - School bus\n   - Monastery\n   - Plate rack (starting point for our calculations)\n   - Box turtle\n   - Miniature Pinscher\n   - Football helmet\n   - Pretzel\n   - Pyrenean Mountain Dog\n   - Soup bowl\n   - Menu\n   - Rifle\n   - Typewriter keyboard\n   - American dipper\n\n2. **Convert the item names to positions**: We assign positions to each item starting from 0 for the garter snake.
