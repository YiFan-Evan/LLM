BFS is particularly well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the start node (node 9) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, explore all its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet, and enqueue them. Mark each newly discovered node as visited.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the shortest path once the destination node is reached.\n4. **Termination**: Stop when the destination node is dequeued from the queue.\n\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [9]\n   - Visited: {9}\n   - Parents: {9: None}\n\n2. **Dequeue 9**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [13]\n   - Update Queue: [13]\n   - Update Visited: {9, 13}\n   - Update Parents: {9: None, 13: 9}\n\n3. **Dequeue 13**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [8, 9]\n   - Node 9 is already visited, so skip it.\n   - Update Queue: [8]\n   - Update Visited: {9, 13, 8}\n   - Update Parents: {9: None, 13: 9, 8: 13}\n\n4. **Dequeue 8**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [0, 13]\n   - Node 13 is already visited, so skip it.\n   - Update Queue: [0]\n   - Update Visited: {9, 13, 8, 0}\n   - Update Parents: {9: None, 13: 9, 8: 13, 0: 8}\n\n5. **Dequeue 0**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [8, 12]\n   - Node 8 is already visited, so skip it.\n   - Update Queue: [12]\n   - Update Visited: {9, 13, 8, 0, 12}\n   - Update Parents: {9: None, 13: 9, 8: 13, 0: 8, 12: 0}\n\n6. **Dequeue 12**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [5, 9]\n   - Node 9 is already visited, so skip it.\n   - Update Queue: [5]\n   - Update Visited: {9, 13, 8, 0, 12, 5}\n   - Update Parents: {9: None, 13: 9, 8: 13, 0: 8, 12: 0, 5: 12}\n\n7. **Dequeue 5**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [12]\n   - Node 12 is already visited, so skip it.\n   - No new nodes to add to the queue.\n\nSince we have exhausted all possible paths without reaching node 3, there is no path from node 9 to node 3 in the given graph.
