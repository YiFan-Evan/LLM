Start at node 0.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Record the path taken to reach each node.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 6], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 7], [5, 6], [6, 7]]\n}\n\n# Finding the shortest path from node 0 to node 5\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 0, 5)\nprint(\"Shortest path from node 0 to node 5 is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths from Start to Target\n**Description:** Find all possible paths from node 0 to node 5.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use DFS to explore all paths.\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3. Record all paths found.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal, path=[], paths=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == goal:\n        paths.append(path)\n    else:\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if start in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == start else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    dfs_all_paths(graph, next_node, goal, path, paths)\n    return paths\n\n# Finding all paths from node 0 to node 5\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, 0, 5)\nprint(\"All paths from node 0 to node 5 are:\")\nfor p in all_paths:\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Checking Connectivity Between Two Nodes\n**Description:** Check if there is a path between node 0 and node 5.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use BFS to check connectivity.\n2. If we can reach the target node, then there is a path.\n\n```python\ndef is_connected(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([start])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return True\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append(next_node)\n    \n    return False\n\n# Checking connectivity from node 0 to node 5\nis_connected_result = is_connected(graph"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 6], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 7], [5, 6], [6, 7]]} The start node: 5 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 0 in the given graph.

We also initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n2. **BFS Loop:** We process nodes level by level using a queue. For each node, we check if it is the goal node. If it is, we return the path.\n3. **Neighbors Processing:** For each node, we find its neighbors by checking the edges. If a neighbor hasn't been visited, we add it to the queue along with the updated path.\n4. **Termination:** The loop continues until we either find the goal or exhaust all possible paths.\n\n### Result:\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 5 to node 0 in the given graph."}]
