Start at node 1.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Record the path taken to reach each node.\n5.

Start at node 1.\n2. Use recursion to explore all paths.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Record all paths that lead to the destination.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal, path=[], paths=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == goal:\n        paths.append(path)\n    else:\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if start in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == start else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    dfs_all_paths(graph, next_node, goal, path, paths)\n    return paths\n\n# Finding all paths from node 1 to node 6\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, 1, 6)\nprint(\"All paths using DFS:\")\nfor p in all_paths:\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path with Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 assuming all edges have equal weight.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Assign a distance value to each node; initialize it to infinity except for the start node which is zero.\n2. Use a priority queue to always expand the least cost node first.\n3. Update the distance values of neighboring nodes as shorter paths are found.\n4.
