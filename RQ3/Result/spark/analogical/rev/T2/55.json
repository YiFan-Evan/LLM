Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - A queue to keep track of nodes to explore next.\n   - A set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - A dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path later.\n\n2. **Start BFS**:\n   - Enqueue the start node and mark it as visited.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore its neighbors.\n   - If a neighbor is the destination, reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary.\n   - If a neighbor hasn't been visited, enqueue it and mark it as visited.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([start])\n    visited = set([start])\n    parent = {start: None}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current == goal:\n            return reconstruct_path(parent, start, goal)\n        \n        for edge in graph['edges']:\n            if edge[0] == current:\n                next_node = edge[1]\n            elif edge[1] == current:\n                next_node = edge[0]\n            else:\n                continue\n            \n            if next_node not in visited:\n                visited.add(next_node)\n                queue.append(next_node)\n                parent[next_node] = current\n    \n    return \"No path found\"\n\ndef reconstruct_path(parent, start, goal):\n    path = []\n    step = goal\n    while step is not None:\n        path.append(step)\n        step = parent[step]\n    path.reverse()\n    return '->'.join(map(str, path))\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]}\nstart_node = 3\ndestination_node = 2\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `queue` starts with the start node `[3]`.\n   - `visited` keeps track of nodes that have been explored `{3}`.\n   - `parent` maps each node to its predecessor in the path `{3: None}`.\n\n2. **BFS Execution**:\n   - Dequeue `3`, check its neighbors `[2, 7]`.\n   - Enqueue `2` and `7`, marking them as visited. Update their parents.\n   - Dequeue `2`, which is the goal node. Reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Starting from `2`, follow the parent pointers back to `3`. The path is `[3, 2]`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\n3->2\n```"}]
