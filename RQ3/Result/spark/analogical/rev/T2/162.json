Record the parent of this neighbor.\n   - If the destination node (23) is reached, stop the search.\n\n3. **Reconstruct Path**:\n   - Starting from the destination node, trace back to the start node using the parent records.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node\n    queue = deque([start])\n    # Dictionary to store visited nodes and their parents\n    visited = {start: None}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if current == goal:\n            break\n        \n        # Get neighbors of the current node\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    visited[next_node] = current\n                    queue.append(next_node)\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path from goal to start using the parent records\n    path = []\n    step = goal\n    while step is not None:\n        path.append(step)\n        step = visited[step]\n    path.reverse()\n    \n    return path\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 11], [1, 3], [3, 22], [3, 7], [4, 16], [4, 11], [4, 21], [5, 21], [5, 15], [6, 7], [6, 8], [8, 18], [8, 11], [9, 20], [10, 21], [12, 15], [13, 17], [14, 20], [14, 24], [15, 20], [17, 21], [19, 21], [20, 23]]\n}\n\n# Find the shortest path from node 22 to node 23\nstart_node = 22\ndestination_node = 23\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path from node {} to node {}: {}\".format(start_node, destination_node, shortest_path))\n```\n\nWhen you run this code, it will output the shortest path from node 22 to node 23 in the given graph."}]
