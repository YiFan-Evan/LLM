Start at node 4.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Record the path taken to reach each node.\n5. Stop when you reach node 2.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 6], [1, 3], [2, 5], [4, 7]]}\nstart_node = 4\ndestination_node = 2\n\n# Find the shortest path using BFS\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path using BFS:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths Using DFS\n**Description:** Use DFS to find all possible paths from node 4 to node 2.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 4.\n2. Use a stack to explore nodes depth first.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Record all paths taken to reach each node.\n5. Stop when you reach node 2 and store the path.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal):\n    stack = [(start, [start])]\n    all_paths = []\n    \n    while stack:\n        current_node, path = stack.pop()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            all_paths.append(path)\n            continue\n        \n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    stack.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return all_paths\n\n# Find all paths using DFS\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"All paths using DFS:\")\nfor path in all_paths:\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path with Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 2 assuming all edges have equal weight.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Assign a distance value to each node; initialize it to infinity except for the start node which is zero.\n2. Use a priority queue to always expand the least cost node first.\n3. Update the distance values of neighboring nodes as shorter paths are found.\n4.
