Start at node 1.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Stop when you reach node 0.\n5.

Use DFS to explore all paths.\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3.

Use BFS as it naturally finds the shortest path in terms of edges.\n2. The same BFS approach used in Problem 1 will work here since BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n```python\n# The solution is the same as Problem 1 using BFS\nshortest_path_fewest_edges = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(shortest_path_fewest_edges)\n```\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\n1->4->0\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 4], [0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 4], [5, 7], [6, 7]]} The start node: 0 The destination: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 0 to node 1 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
