Start at node 1.\n2. Use recursion to explore each node depth first.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4.

Note that this is more applicable to weighted graphs, but we will assume equal weights for simplicity.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Assign a distance value to each node; initialize the starting node as 0 and others as infinity.\n2. Use a priority queue to always expand the least cost node first.\n3.
