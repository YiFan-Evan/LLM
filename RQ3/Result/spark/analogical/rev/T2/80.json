Here's how we can do it step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - A queue to keep track of nodes to explore next.\n   - A dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path later.\n   - A set to keep track of visited nodes.\n\n2. **Start BFS**:\n   - Enqueue the start node and mark it as visited.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore its neighbors.\n   - For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited, enqueue it, mark it as visited, and record its parent.\n\n3. **Reconstruct Path**:\n   - Once the destination node is reached, backtrack using the parent dictionary to construct the path from start to destination.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize data structures\n    queue = deque([start])\n    visited = {start}\n    parent = {start: None}\n    \n    # BFS loop\n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If we reach the goal, reconstruct the path\n        if current == goal:\n            path = []\n            while current is not None:\n                path.append(current)\n                current = parent[current]\n            return '->'.join(map(str, path[::-1]))\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    visited.add(next_node)\n                    parent[next_node] = current\n                    queue.append(next_node)\n    \n    return \"No path found\"\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],\n    'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 11], [3, 9], [3, 10], [4, 5], [4, 12], [5, 8], [5, 11], [6, 9], [7, 10], [10, 11]]\n}\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 1\ndestination_node = 5\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `queue` is initialized with the start node.\n   - `visited` keeps track of nodes that have been explored.\n   - `parent` dictionary helps in reconstructing the path once the destination is reached.\n\n2. **BFS Loop**:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - Check if it is the goal node. If so, reconstruct the path using the `parent` dictionary.\n   - Otherwise, explore its neighbors.
