Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution Using BFS\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Start with the start node `2`.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of nodes to explore, starting with the initial node.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n\n2. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - For each neighbor of the current node, if it hasn't been visited yet:\n     - Mark it as visited.\n     - Record the path to this neighbor.\n     - Enqueue the neighbor.\n   - If the destination node is reached, return the path.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n   ```python\n   from collections import deque\n\n   def bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n       queue = deque([start])\n       visited = set([start])\n       parent = {start: None}\n       \n       while queue:\n           current_node = queue.popleft()\n           \n           if current_node == goal:\n               # Reconstruct the path\n               path = []\n               while current_node is not None:\n                   path.append(current_node)\n                   current_node = parent[current_node]\n               return path[::-1]  # Return reversed path\n           \n           for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n               if current_node in neighbor:\n                   next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                   if next_node not in visited:\n                       visited.add(next_node)\n                       parent[next_node] = current_node\n                       queue.append(next_node)\n       \n       return None  # No path found\n\n   # Graph definition\n   graph = {\n       'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n       'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 5], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n   }\n\n   # Finding the shortest path from node 2 to node 1\n   start_node = 2\n   destination_node = 1\n   shortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\n   print(\"Shortest path from node 2 to node 1 is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n   ```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize the queue with the start node and mark it as visited. The `parent` dictionary helps us reconstruct the path once we reach the destination.\n- **BFS Loop**: We dequeue nodes one by one, check their neighbors, and enqueue unvisited neighbors while marking them as visited. We also record the parent of each node to help reconstruct the path.\n- **Path Reconstruction**: Once we reach the destination node, we backtrack using the `parent` dictionary to construct the path from start to destination.\n\n### Result:\nRunning the above code will give you the shortest path from node 2 to node 1 in the provided graph."}]
