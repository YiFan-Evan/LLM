Start at node 3.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Record the path taken to reach each node.\n5. Stop when you reach node 1.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 6], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 5], [6, 7]]\n}\n\n# Finding the shortest path from node 3 to node 1\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 3, 1)\nprint(\"Shortest path from node 3 to node 1 is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths Using DFS\n**Description:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to find all possible paths from node 3 to node 1.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 3.\n2. Use recursion to explore all paths.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4.

Use a priority queue to always expand the least cost node first.\n2. Maintain a dictionary to store the minimum cost to reach each node.\n3. Update costs as shorter paths are found.\n4. Reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = [(0, start, [])]\n    visited = set()\n    min_cost = {node: float('inf') for node in graph['nodes']}\n    min_cost[start] = 0\n    \n    while queue:\n        (cost, current_node, path) = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        \n        if current_node in"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 6], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 5], [6, 7]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution Using BFS\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Start with the start node `1`.\n   - Use a queue to keep track of nodes to explore, starting with the initial node and an empty path.\n   - Use a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n\n2. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - If this node is the destination node `3`, return the path taken to reach it.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors along with the updated path.\n   - Mark the current node as visited.\n   - Repeat until the queue is empty or the destination node is found.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node and an empty path\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue a node and its path\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Enqueue all unvisited neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    # Return None if there is no path from start to goal\n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 6], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 5], [6, 7]]\n}\n\n# Finding the shortest path from node 1 to node 3\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 1, 3)\nprint(\"Shortest path from node 1 to node 3 is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- We initialize the queue with the start node `1` and an empty path `[1]`.\n- We use a set `visited` to keep track of nodes that have already been processed.\n- In each iteration of the loop, we dequeue a node and check if it is the goal node `3`. If it is, we return the path.\n- If not, we mark the node as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors with the updated path.\n- The process continues until we either find the goal node or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n### Output:\nThe output will be:\n```\nShortest path from node 1 to node 3 is: 1->4->3\n```\nThis indicates that the shortest path from node `1` to node `3` is through node `4`."}]
