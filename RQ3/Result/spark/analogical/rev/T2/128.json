This algorithm is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the start node (node 6) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, explore all its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet, and enqueue them. Mark each newly discovered node as visited.\n3. **Path Tracking**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Termination**: Stop when the destination node (node 12) is dequeued from the queue.

If it is, we return the path.\n- If not, we mark the node as visited and explore its neighbors. For each unvisited neighbor, we create a new path by appending the neighbor to the current path and enqueue this new path.\n- This process continues until we either find the destination node or exhaust all possible paths.\n\n### Shortest Path:\nThe output will be the shortest path from node 6 to node 12 in the format specified."}]
