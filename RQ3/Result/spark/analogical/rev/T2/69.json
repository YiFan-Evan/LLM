Here's how you can approach it:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution Using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Start with node 6.\n   - Use a queue to manage nodes to explore.\n   - Maintain a set of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n\n2. **Algorithm**:\n   - Enqueue the start node (6) along with its path.\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue the front element (current node and its path).\n     - If the current node is the destination (5), return the path.\n     - Mark the current node as visited.\n     - For each neighbor of the current node:\n       - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n         - Enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path.\n\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - If there is no path from node 6 to node 5, the algorithm should handle this gracefully.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 7], [5, 7]]\n}\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 6\ndestination_node = 5\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path from {} to {} is: {}\".format(start_node, destination_node, '->'.join(map(str, shortest_path))))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- The `bfs_shortest_path` function initializes a queue with the start node and an empty path.\n- It processes each node by exploring its neighbors and enqueues them if they haven't been visited yet.\n- When the destination node is reached, it returns the path taken to get there.\n- If no path exists, it returns `None`.\n\n### Result:\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 6 to node 5 in the given graph."}]
