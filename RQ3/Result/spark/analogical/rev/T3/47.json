Here's how it works step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start with the start node (node 0). Create a queue and enqueue the start node along with an empty path list that contains only the start node. Also, create a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n\n2. **Process the Queue**: Dequeue an element from the front of the queue. This element consists of the current node and the path taken to reach this node. Check if the current node is the destination node (node 3). If it is, return the path as the shortest path.\n\n3. **Explore Neighbors**: If the current node is not the destination, explore all its neighbors (nodes connected directly by an edge). For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited yet, mark it as visited, create a new path by adding this neighbor to the existing path, and enqueue this neighbor along with the new path.\n\n4. **Repeat**: Continue processing the queue until you either find the destination or the queue is empty (in which case there is no path from the start node to the destination).\n\nHere's the implementation of the above steps:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node and an empty path\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue the first element\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we reached the goal\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return '->'.join(map(str, path))\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in neighbor:\n                # Find the other node in the edge\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    # Enqueue the next node with the updated path\n                    queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return \"No path found\"\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 4], [3, 6], [4, 5], [4, 7]]}\nstart_node = 0\ndestination_node = 3\n\n# Finding the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a queue with a tuple containing the start node and a list containing just the start node.
