BFS is particularly well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the start node (node 9) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, explore all its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet, and enqueue them. Mark each newly discovered node as visited.\n3. **Path Tracking**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Termination**: Stop when the destination node (node 0) is dequeued from the queue. The path associated with this node will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [9]\n   - Visited: {9}\n   - Paths: {9: [9]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 9**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [10]\n   - Update Queue: [10]\n   - Update Visited: {9, 10}\n   - Update Paths: {9: [9], 10: [9, 10]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 10**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [8, 9]\n   - Node 9 is already visited, so only node 8 is added to the queue.\n   - Update Queue: [8]\n   - Update Visited: {9, 10, 8}\n   - Update Paths: {9: [9], 10: [9, 10], 8: [9, 10, 8]}\n\n4. **Dequeue 8**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [10, 0]\n   - Node 10 is already visited, so only node 0 is added to the queue.\n   - Update Queue: [0]\n   - Update Visited: {9, 10, 8, 0}\n   - Update Paths: {9: [9], 10: [9, 10], 8: [9, 10, 8], 0: [9, 10, 8, 0]}\n\n5. **Dequeue 0**:\n   - Node 0 is the destination node.\n   - The path to node 0 is [9, 10, 8, 0].\n\nThus, the shortest path from node 9 to node 0 is `[9, 10, 8, 0]`."}]
