We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding the Shortest Path Using BFS\n**Description:** Use BFS to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 6.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 5.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Stop when you reach node 6.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (vertex, path) = queue.popleft()\n        if vertex in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        for next in graph['edges']:\n            if vertex == next[0] and next[1] not in visited:\n                if next[1] == goal:\n                    return path + [goal]\n                else:\n                    queue.append((next[1], path + [next[1]]))\n            elif vertex == next[1] and next[0] not in visited:\n                if next[0] == goal:\n                    return path + [goal]\n                else:\n                    queue.append((next[0], path + [next[0]]))\n        \n        visited.add(vertex)\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 7], [5, 7]]}\nstart_node = 5\ndestination_node = 6\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path from {} to {} is: {}\".format(start_node, destination_node, \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path))))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths from Node 5 to Node 6\n**Description:** Find all possible paths from node 5 to node 6.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use DFS to explore all paths.\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3.

This is essentially the same as finding the shortest path using BFS since BFS finds the shortest path in terms of edges.\n2. The solution is the same as Problem 1.\n\n```python\n# The solution is the same as Problem 1\nshortest_path_fewest_edges = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path with fewest edges from {} to {} is: {}"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 7], [5, 7]]} The start node: 5 The destination: \".join(map(str, shortest_path))))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths from Node 5 to Node 6\n**Description:** Find all possible paths from node 5 to node 6.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.

Each path represents a sequence of nodes from the start node to the destination node without revisiting any node within a single path."}]
