We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding the shortest path using BFS\n**Description:** Use BFS to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 0.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Stop when you reach node 3.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (vertex, path) = queue.popleft()\n        if vertex in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add(vertex)\n        \n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if vertex in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == vertex else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    if next_node == goal:\n                        return path + [next_node]\n                    else:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    return None\n\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 6], [2, 4], [3, 5], [6, 7]]}\nstart = 0\ngoal = 3\nresult = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal)\nprint(\"->\".join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm\n**Description:** Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.
