We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding the Shortest Path Using BFS\n**Description:** Use BFS to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 in the provided graph.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 5.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Record the path taken to reach each node.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 7], [2, 4], [2, 3], [3, 7], [6, 7]]\n}\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 5\ndestination_node = 4\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path from {} to {} is: {}\".format(start_node, destination_node, \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path))))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths from Node 5 to Node 4\n**Description:** Find all possible paths from node 5 to node 4 in the provided graph.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use DFS to explore all possible paths.\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3. Record all paths found.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal, path=[], paths=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == goal:\n        paths.append(path)\n    else:\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if start in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == start else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    dfs_all_paths(graph, next_node, goal, path, paths)\n    return paths\n\n# Find all paths\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"All paths from {} to {} are:\".format(start_node, destination_node))\nfor p in all_paths:\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path with Fewest Edges\n**Description:** Find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 in terms of the number of edges traversed.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. This is essentially the same as finding the shortest path using BFS since BFS finds the shortest path in terms of edges.\n2. The solution remains the same as Problem 1.\n\n```python\n# The solution is the same as Problem 1\nshortest_path_fewest_edges = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path with fewest edges from {} to {} is: {}\".format(start_node, destination_node, \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path_fewest_edges))))\n```\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is:\nThe shortest path from node 5 to node "}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 7], [2, 4], [2, 3], [3, 7], [6, 7]]} The start node: 5 The destination: \".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path with Fewest Edges\n**Description:** Find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 in terms of the number of edges traversed.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.

Start at node 5.\n2. From node 5, you can go to nodes 1 or 7 (as per the given edges).\n3. To minimize the number of edges, choose node 7 next.\n4. From node 7, you can go to nodes 3 or 6 (as per the given edges).\n5. To minimize the number of edges, choose node 3 next.\n6. From node 3, you can go to nodes 0 or 2 (as per the given edges).\n7. To minimize the number of edges, choose node 0 next.\n8.
