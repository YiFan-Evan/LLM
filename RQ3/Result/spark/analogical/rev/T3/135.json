We also maintain a parent dictionary to help reconstruct the path.\n- **BFS Traversal**: We dequeue a node, check if it's the goal node. If so, we reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary. Otherwise, we mark it as visited and enqueue its neighbors that haven't been visited yet.\n- **Path Reconstruction**: Once we reach the goal node, we backtrack using the parent dictionary to construct the path from start to goal.\n\n### Result:\nThe output will be the shortest path from node 13 to node 10 in the format `13->...->10`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\n13->14->10\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 5], [1, 10], [2, 5], [2, 14], [3, 9], [4, 9], [4, 10], [5, 11], [5, 10], [6, 13], [7, 8], [7, 14], [9, 12], [13, 14]]} The start node: 13 The destination: 14"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 13 to node 14 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
