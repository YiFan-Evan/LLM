We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to ensure that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding the Shortest Path Using BFS\n**Description:** Use BFS to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 0.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Record the path taken to reach each node.\n5. Stop when you reach node 4.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 7], [2, 5], [3, 6], [4, 5]]}\nstart_node = 0\ndestination_node = 4\n\n# Find the shortest path using BFS\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths and Selecting the Shortest One\n**Description:** Find all possible paths from node 0 to node 4 and select the shortest one.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use DFS to explore all paths from the start node to the destination node.\n2. Track all paths found.\n3. Select the shortest path from the list of all paths.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal, path=[], paths=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == goal:\n        paths.append(path)\n    else:\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if start in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == start else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    dfs_all_paths(graph, next_node, goal, path, paths)\n    return paths\n\n# Find all paths using DFS\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nshortest_path = min(all_paths, key=len)\nprint(\"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path with Dijkstra's Algorithm (Applicable for Weighted Graphs)\n**Description:** Although the graph provided is unweighted, we can still use Dijkstra's algorithm for educational purposes. Assume all edges have equal weight.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use a priority queue to always expand the least cost node first.\n2. Maintain a distance dictionary to keep track of the shortest known distance to each node.\n3. Update distances as shorter paths are found.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = [(0, start, [])]\n    seen = set()\n    mins = {start: 0}\n    \n    while queue:\n        (cost, v1, path) = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        \n        if v1 not in seen:\n            seen.add(v1)\n            path = path + [v1"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 1], [1, 2], [1, 7], [2, 5], [3, 6], [4, 5]]} The start node: 0 The destination: \".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths and Selecting the Shortest One\n**Description:** Find all possible paths from node 0 to node 4 and select the shortest one.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.
