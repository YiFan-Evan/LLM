Use DFS to explore all paths.\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3.

Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution Using BFS\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Start with node 5.\n   - Use a queue to manage the nodes to explore.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the path taken to reach each node.\n\n2. **Algorithm**:\n   - Enqueue the start node (5) and mark it as visited.\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n     - For each neighbor of the current node:\n       - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n         - Mark it as visited.\n         - Record the path to this neighbor.\n         - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination node (7), return the recorded path.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node and its path\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue a node and its path\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If the current node is the goal, return the path\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for edge in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in edge:\n                next_node = edge[1] if edge[0] == current_node else edge[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    # Record the path to the next node\n                    new_path = path + [next_node]\n                    queue.append((next_node, new_path))\n    \n    # If there's no path found, return None\n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 6], [0, 1], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [5, 7]]}\nstart = 5\ngoal = 7\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal)\nprint(\"Shortest path from {} to {} is: {}\".format(start, goal, \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path))))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize the queue with the starting node `5` and an initial path containing only `5`. The `visited` set keeps track of nodes that have already been processed.\n- **Queue Processing**: We process each node by dequeuing it and checking its neighbors. If a neighbor hasn't been visited, we add it to the queue along with the updated path.\n- **Path Recording**: When we reach the goal node `7`, we return the path that led us here.\n- **Output**: The final output will be the shortest path from node `5` to node `7`.\n\n### Result:\nRunning the above code will give you the shortest path from node `5` to node `7` in the given graph."}]
