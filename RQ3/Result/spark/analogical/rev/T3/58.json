Start at node 4.\n2. Use a stack to explore nodes depth first.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Track the path taken to reach each node.\n5. Collect all paths that reach node 2.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal):\n    stack = [(start, [start])]\n    all_paths = []\n    \n    while stack:\n        current_node, path = stack.pop()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            all_paths.append(path)\n            continue\n        \n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    stack.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return all_paths\n\n# Find all paths using DFS\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"All paths using DFS:\")\nfor path in all_paths:\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path with Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 2 assuming all edges have equal weight.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Assign a distance value to each node; initialize it to infinity except for the start node which is zero.\n2. Use a priority queue to always expand the least cost node first.\n3. Update the distance values of neighboring nodes as shorter paths are found.\n4. Stop when the destination node is reached.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = [(0, start, [start])]\n    distances = {node: float('inf') for node"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 6], [1, 3], [2, 5], [4, 7]]} The start node: 4 The destination: \".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths Using DFS\n**Description:** Use DFS to find all possible paths from node 4 to node 2.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.

If this neighbor hasn't been visited in the current path, push it onto the stack along with the updated path.\n5. **Output**: After the loop completes, we print all collected paths.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible paths from node 4 to node 2 are found and printed."}]
