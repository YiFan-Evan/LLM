We also create an empty list `all_paths` to store all the paths found.\n2. **BFS Loop**: While there are paths left in the queue:\n   - We pop the first path from the queue.\n   - We get the last node in this path.\n   - If this node is the goal node (`node == goal`), we add this path to `all_paths`.\n   - Otherwise, we find all neighbors of the current node by checking both ends of each edge in the graph.\n   - For each neighbor, we create a new path by appending the neighbor to the current path and add this new path to the queue.\n3. **Output**: After the loop finishes, we print all the paths stored in `all_paths`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we explore all possible paths from the start node to the destination node and collect them in a list."}]
