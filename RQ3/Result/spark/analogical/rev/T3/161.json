For each node, we check its neighbors and add them to the queue if they haven't been visited yet. This ensures that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n- **Path Tracking**: Each element in the queue is a tuple containing the current node and the path taken to reach that node. When we reach the destination node, we return the path.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nThe shortest path is: 4->15->5\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 5], [1, 2], [1, 14], [1, 15], [3, 4], [4, 7], [4, 10], [4, 13], [4, 15], [5, 17], [6, 20], [6, 13], [8, 12], [8, 15], [8, 19], [9, 12], [11, 23], [11, 14], [13, 21], [13, 22], [16, 17], [17, 24], [18, 22], [19, 24]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 15"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 4 to node 15 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).

If not, we mark it as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors along with the updated path.\n- **Neighbors**: We find neighbors by checking both ends of each edge in the graph.\n- **Termination**:"}]
