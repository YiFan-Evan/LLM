Use DFS to explore all paths.\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3. Collect all paths that end at node 3.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal, path=[], paths=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == goal:\n        paths.append(path)\n    else:\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if start in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == start else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    dfs_all_paths(graph, next_node, goal, path, paths)\n    return paths\n\n# Find all paths\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"All paths from {} to {} are:\".format(start_node, destination_node))\nfor p in all_paths:\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the shortest path considering edge weights\n**Description:** Assuming each edge has a weight of 1, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use a priority queue to always expand the least cost node first.\n2. Maintain a dictionary to store the minimum cost to reach each node.\n3. Update costs and paths as shorter paths are found.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = [(0, start, [])]\n    visited = set()\n    min_cost = {start: 0}\n    \n    while queue:\n        (cost, current_node, path) = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        \n        if current_node in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        path = path + [current_node]\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n       "}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6]]} The start node: 1 The destination: \".join(map(str, shortest_path))))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding all paths from node 1 to node 3\n**Description:** Find all possible paths from node 1 to node 3.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.
