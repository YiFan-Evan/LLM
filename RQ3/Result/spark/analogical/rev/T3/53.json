We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding the Shortest Path Using BFS\n**Description:** Use BFS to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 1.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 6.\n2. Use a queue to explore each node level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Record the path taken to reach each node.\n5. Stop when you reach node 1.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[0] if neighbor[1] == current_node else neighbor[1]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 6], [3, 7]]}\n\n# Finding the shortest path from node 6 to node 1\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 6, 1)\nprint(\"Shortest path from node 6 to node 1 is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths from Node 6 to Node 1\n**Description:** Find all possible paths from node 6 to node 1.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use DFS to explore all paths from node 6 to node 1.\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3. Record all paths found.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal, path=[], paths=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == goal:\n        paths.append(path)\n    else:\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if start in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[0] if neighbor[1] == start else neighbor[1]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    dfs_all_paths(graph, next_node, goal, path, paths)\n    return paths\n\n# Finding all paths from node 6 to node 1\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, 6, 1)\nprint(\"All paths from node 6 to node 1 are:\")\nfor p in all_paths:\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path with Fewest Edges\n**Description:** Find the shortest path from node 6 to node 1 using the fewest edges.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use BFS as it naturally finds the shortest path in terms of edges.\n2. The same BFS approach used in Problem 1 will work here since BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n```python\n# The solution is the same as Problem 1 using BFS\nshortest_path_fewest_edges = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 6, 1)\nprint(\"Shortest path with fewest edges from node 6 to node 1 is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path_fewest_edges)))\n```\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is:\nThe shortest path from node 6 to node 1 is: **6->3->7->1**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 6], [3, 7]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 6 to node 7 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

We also initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n2. **Processing Nodes:** We process nodes level by level using BFS. For each node, we check if it is the goal node. If it is, we return the path.\n3. **Exploring Neighbors:** For each node, we explore its neighbors that are connected by an edge and have not been visited yet. We add these neighbors to the queue along with the updated path.\n4. **Termination:** The loop continues until we either find the goal node or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is:\nThe shortest path from node 6 to node 7 is: **6->3->7**"}]
