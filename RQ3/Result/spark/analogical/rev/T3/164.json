Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list where each node points to its connected nodes.\n2. **BFS Algorithm**: BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - A queue to keep track of nodes to be explored.\n   - A dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n   - A set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n\n2. **Start BFS**:\n   - Enqueue the start node and mark it as visited.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore its neighbors.\n   - For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited, enqueue it, mark it as visited, and record its parent.\n   - If the destination node is reached, stop the search.\n\n3. **Reconstruct Path**:\n   - Use the parent dictionary to backtrack from the destination node to the start node to construct the path.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize data structures\n    queue = deque([start])\n    visited = {start}\n    parent = {start: None}\n    \n    # BFS loop\n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if current == goal:\n            break\n        \n        # Explore neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[current]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                parent[neighbor] = current\n    \n    # Reconstruct path\n    path = []\n    step = goal\n    while step is not None:\n        path.append(step)\n        step = parent[step]\n    path.reverse()\n    \n    return path\n\n# Graph representation as an adjacency list\ngraph = {\n    0: [4], 1: [2], 2: [10], 3: [16, 18, 24], 4: [19], 5: [8, 15, 18], 6: [24], 7: [10, 9], 9: [20, 13, 23], 11: [17, 12], 12: [15], 13: [19], 14: [22], 17: [21], 19: [22], 21: [23]\n}\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 2\ndestination_node = 20\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list using a dictionary where keys are nodes and values are lists of neighboring nodes.\n- **BFS Function**: `bfs_shortest_path` function performs BFS to find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.
