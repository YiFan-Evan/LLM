We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to ensure that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding the Shortest Path Using BFS\n**Description:** Use Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 1.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Stop when you reach node 3.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (vertex, path) = queue.popleft()\n        if vertex in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        for next in graph['edges']:\n            if vertex == next[0] and next[1] not in visited:\n                if next[1] == goal:\n                    return path + [next[1]]\n                else:\n                    queue.append((next[1], path + [next[1]]))\n            elif vertex == next[1] and next[0] not in visited:\n                if next[0] == goal:\n                    return path + [next[0]]\n                else:\n                    queue.append((next[0], path + [next[0]]))\n        \n        visited.add(vertex)\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]}\nstart_node = 1\ndestination_node = 3\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths from Start to Goal\n**Description:** Find all possible paths from node 1 to node 3.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use DFS to explore all paths.\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3. Collect paths that end at the goal node.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal, path=[], paths=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == goal:\n        paths.append(path)\n    else:\n        for next in graph['edges']:\n            if start == next[0] and next[1] not in path:\n                dfs_all_paths(graph, next[1], goal, path, paths)\n            elif start == next[1] and next[0] not in path:\n                dfs_all_paths(graph, next[0], goal, path, paths)\n    return paths\n\n# Find all paths\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nfor p in all_paths:\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path with Fewest Edges\n**Description:** Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 using the fewest edges.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. This is essentially the same as Problem 1 since BFS naturally finds the shortest path in terms of edges.\n2. Use BFS as described in Problem 1.\n\n```python\n# The solution is the same as Problem 1 using BFS\nshortest_path_fewest_edges = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path_fewest_edges)))\n```\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\n1->3\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The start node: 1 The destination: \".join(map(str, shortest_path_fewest_edges)))\n```\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\n1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem of finding the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 in the given graph, we will use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
