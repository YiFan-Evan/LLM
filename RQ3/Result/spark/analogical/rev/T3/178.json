Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list where each node points to its connected nodes.\n2. **Initialization**: We start at node 6 and initialize a queue for BFS with the starting node. We also maintain a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parent nodes to reconstruct the path later.\n3. **BFS Traversal**: We dequeue a node, check all its neighbors, and enqueue any unvisited neighbors while marking them as visited. This continues until we either find the destination node or exhaust all possible paths.\n4. **Path Reconstruction**: Once we reach the destination node, we backtrack using the parent dictionary to construct the path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([start])\n    # Dictionary to store visited nodes and their parents\n    visited = {start: None}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If we reach the goal, reconstruct the path\n        if current == goal:\n            path = []\n            while current is not None:\n                path.append(current)\n                current = visited[current]\n            return '->'.join(map(str, path[::-1]))\n        \n        # Get all adjacent nodes\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    queue.append(next_node)\n                    visited[next_node] = current\n    \n    return \"No path found\"\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 12], [2, 14], [2, 17], [2, 18], [2, 24], [3, 4], [3, 24], [5, 21], [6, 21], [7, 21], [8, 24], [9, 19], [9, 16], [10, 24], [11, 12], [11, 23], [11, 19], [13, 19], [15, 19], [16, 24], [18, 21], [19, 20], [20, 22]]\n}\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 6\ndestination_node = 4\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(f\"The shortest path from {start_node} to {destination_node} is: {shortest_path}\")\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Queue Initialization**: We initialize a queue with the start node and a dictionary `visited` to keep track of visited nodes and their parents.\n2. **BFS Traversal**: We dequeue nodes one by one, check their neighbors, and enqueue unvisited neighbors.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: When the destination node is reached, we backtrack using the parent dictionary to build the path.\n\n### Shortest Path:\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 6 to node 4.
