We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding the Shortest Path Using BFS\n**Description:** Use BFS to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 1.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 2.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Track the path taken to reach each node.\n5. Stop when you reach node 1.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 7], [3, 5], [5, 6]]\n}\n\n# Finding the shortest path from node 2 to node 1\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 2, 1)\nprint(\"Shortest path from node 2 to node 1 is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths Using DFS\n**Description:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to find all possible paths from node 2 to node 1.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 2.\n2. Use recursion to explore all paths.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Collect all paths that lead to the destination node.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal, path=[], paths=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == goal:\n        paths.append(path)\n    else:\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if start in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == start else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    dfs_all_paths(graph, next_node, goal, path, paths)\n    return paths\n\n# Finding all paths from node 2 to node 1\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, 2, 1)\nprint(\"All paths from node 2 to node 1 are:\")\nfor p in all_paths:\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path with Weights\n**Description:** Assume each edge has a weight and find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use a priority queue to always expand the least cost node first.\n2. Maintain a dictionary to store the minimum cost to reach each node.\n3. Update costs as shorter paths are found.\n4. Reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = [(0, start, [])]\n    visited = set()\n    min_cost = {node: float('inf') for node in graph['nodes']}\n    min_cost[start] = 0\n    \n    while queue:\n        (cost, current_node, path) = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        \n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 7], [3, 5], [5, 6]]} The start node: 2 The destination: \".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding All Paths Using DFS\n**Description:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to find all possible paths from node 2 to node 1.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.

If this next node has not been visited yet (to avoid cycles), recursively call `dfs_all_paths` with the next node.\n4. **Graph Definition**: The graph is defined with nodes and edges as given.\n5. **Finding Paths**: Call `dfs_all_paths` starting from node 2 to node 1 and print all the paths found.\n\nThis approach ensures that all possible paths from node 2 to node 1 are explored and printed."}]
