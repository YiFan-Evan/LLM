BFS is particularly well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the start node (node 3) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, explore all its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet, and enqueue them. Mark each explored node as visited.\n3. **Path Tracking**: Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Termination**: Stop when the destination node (node 12) is dequeued from the queue. The path associated with this node will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [3]\n   - Visited: {3}\n   - Paths: {3: [3]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 3**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [2]\n   - Update Queue: [2]\n   - Update Visited: {2, 3}\n   - Update Paths: {3: [3], 2: [3, 2]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 2**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [3, 6, 14] (but 3 is already visited)\n   - Update Queue: [6, 14]\n   - Update Visited: {2, 3, 6, 14}\n   - Update Paths: {3: [3], 2: [3, 2], 6: [3, 2, 6], 14: [3, 2, 14]}\n\n4. **Dequeue 6**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [2, 7, 11] (but 2 is already visited)\n   - Update Queue: [7, 11, 14]\n   - Update Visited: {2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 14}\n   - Update Paths: {3: [3], 2: [3, 2], 6: [3, 2, 6], 7: [3, 2, 6, 7], 11: [3, 2, 6, 11], 14: [3, 2, 14]}\n\n5. **Dequeue 7**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [6, 12] (but 6 is already visited)\n   - Update Queue: [11, 12, 14]\n   - Update Visited: {2, 3, 6, 7, 11, 12, 14}\n   - Update Paths: {3: [3], 2: [3, 2], 6: [3, 2, 6], 7: [3, 2, 6, 7], 11: [3, 2, 6, 11], 12: [3, 2, 6, 7, 12], 14: [3, 2, 14]}\n\n6. **Dequeue 11**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [6] (but 6 is already visited)\n   - No update to queue or paths needed.\n\n7. **Dequeue 12**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [7] (but 7 is already visited)\n   - No update to queue or paths needed.\n\n8. **Dequeue 14**:\n   - Adjacent nodes: [2] (but 2 is already visited)\n   - No update to queue or paths needed.\n\nSince we have reached node 12, the shortest path is found.
