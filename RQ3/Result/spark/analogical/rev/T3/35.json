We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm which is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Problem 1: Finding the shortest path using BFS\n**Description:** Use BFS to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Start at node 0.\n2. Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Stop when you reach node 4.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (vertex, path) = queue.popleft()\n        if vertex in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add(vertex)\n        \n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if vertex in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == vertex else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    if next_node == goal:\n                        return path + [next_node]\n                    else:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    return None\n\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 6], [2, 5], [3, 4], [4, 5], [4, 6], [6, 7]]}\nstart = 0\ngoal = 4\nprint(\"Problem 1 solution:\", \"->\".join(map(str, bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal))))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Finding all paths from node 0 to node 4\n**Description:** Find all possible paths from node 0 to node 4.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use DFS to explore all paths.\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n3. Collect paths that end at the destination node.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal, path=[], paths=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == goal:\n        paths.append(path)\n    else:\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if start in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == start else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    dfs_all_paths(graph, next_node, goal, path, paths)\n    return paths\n\nprint(\"Problem 2 solution:\")\nfor p in dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal):\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm\n**Description:** Although the graph is unweighted, we can still use Dijkstra's algorithm for consistency.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Use a priority queue to always expand the least cost node first.\n2. Since all edges have equal weight (1), it behaves like BFS.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = [(0, start, [])]\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (cost, vertex, path) = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        if vertex in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        visited.add(vertex)\n        path = path + [vertex]\n        \n        if vertex == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if vertex in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == vertex else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    heapq.heappush(queue, (cost + 1, next_node, path))\n    return None\n\nprint(\"Problem 3 solution:\", \"->\".join(map(str, dijks"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 6], [2, 5], [3, 4], [4, 5], [4, 6], [6, 7]]} The start node: 0 The destination: \".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm\n**Description:** Although the graph is unweighted, we can still use Dijkstra's algorithm for consistency.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.
