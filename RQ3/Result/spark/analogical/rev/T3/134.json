This continues until we reach the destination node.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the destination node is reached, we backtrack using the parent pointers stored in the `visited` dictionary to reconstruct the path from the destination node back to the start node. Finally, we format and print the path.\n\nRunning this code will give you the shortest path from node 2 to node 8 in the given graph."}]
