We also maintain a set of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n- **BFS Process**: We dequeue a path and check if the last node in the path is the goal. If it is, we return the path formatted as a string. Otherwise, we mark the node as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors along with the current path extended by these neighbors.\n- **Termination**: The process continues until we either find the goal or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n### Shortest Path:\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 6 to node 12 in the specified graph."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 12], [1, 8], [1, 13], [2, 13], [2, 12], [3, 10], [3, 13], [4, 9], [5, 12], [5, 6], [6, 7], [6, 14], [8, 9], [9, 11]]} The end node: 12 The start node: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 6 to node 12 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
