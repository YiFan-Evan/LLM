We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Here's how we can do it step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n\n1. **Initialize Data Structures**:\n   - A queue to keep track of nodes to explore next.\n   - A dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path later.\n   - A set to keep track of visited nodes.\n\n2. **Start BFS**:\n   - Enqueue the start node and mark it as visited.\n   - While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore its neighbors.\n   - For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited, enqueue it, mark it as visited, and record its parent.\n   - If the destination node is reached, stop the search.\n\n3. **Reconstruct the Path**:\n   - Use the parent dictionary to backtrack from the destination node to the start node.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere's the Python code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize data structures\n    queue = deque([start])\n    parents = {start: None}\n    visited = set([start])\n    \n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current == goal:\n            break\n        \n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    visited.add(next_node)\n                    queue.append(next_node)\n                    parents[next_node] = current\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path\n    path = []\n    step = goal\n    while step is not None:\n        path.append(step)\n        step = parents[step]\n    path.reverse()\n    \n    return '->'.join(map(str, path))\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [3, 7], [4, 6], [6, 7]]}\nstart_node = 0\ndestination_node = 6\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `queue` is initialized with the start node.\n   - `parents` dictionary keeps track of each node's parent to help reconstruct the path.\n   - `visited` set ensures that each node is processed only once.\n\n2. **BFS Loop**:\n   - The loop continues until the queue is empty or the destination node is found.\n   - For each node, all its neighbors are checked. If a neighbor hasn't been visited, it's added to the queue, marked as visited, and its parent is recorded.\n\n3. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Once the destination node is reached, the path is reconstructed by backtracking from the destination to the start using the `parents` dictionary.\n   - The path is then reversed and formatted as a string.\n\n### Shortest Path Result\n\nRunning the provided code will give us the shortest path from node 0 to node 6 in the given graph.
