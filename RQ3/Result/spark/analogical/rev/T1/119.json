When the destination node (3) is reached, the path is reconstructed using the parent records.\n- **Path Reconstruction**: The path is reconstructed by backtracking from the destination node to the start node using the parent records stored in the visited dictionary.\n\nRunning this code will give you the shortest path from node 5 to node 3 in the given graph."}]
