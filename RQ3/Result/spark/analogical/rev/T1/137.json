We also maintain a set of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n- **BFS Process**: We dequeue a node and check its neighbors. If a neighbor is the goal node, we return the path including this neighbor. Otherwise, we enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path and mark it as visited.\n- **Result**: The function returns the shortest path from node 6 to node 10.\n\n### Shortest Path:\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 6 to node 10.
