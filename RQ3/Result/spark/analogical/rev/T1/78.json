Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution Using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Start with node 5.\n   - Use a queue to manage the nodes to explore.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Track the path taken to reach each node.\n\n2. **Algorithm**:\n   - Enqueue the start node (5) along with its path.\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue the front element (current node and its path).\n     - If the current node is the destination (6), return the path.\n     - For each neighbor of the current node:\n       - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n         - Mark it as visited.\n         - Enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path.\n\n3. **Implementation**:\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (vertex, path) = queue.popleft()\n        if vertex in visited:\n            continue\n        \n        for next in graph['edges']:\n            if vertex == next[0] and next[1] not in visited:\n                if next[1] == goal:\n                    return path + [goal]\n                else:\n                    queue.append((next[1], path + [next[1]]))\n            elif vertex == next[1] and next[0] not in visited:\n                if next[0] == goal:\n                    return path + [goal]\n                else:\n                    queue.append((next[0], path + [next[0]]))\n        \n        visited.add(vertex)\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 6], [0, 1], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [5, 7]]}\nstart_node = 5\ndestination_node = 6\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path from {} to {} is: {}\".format(start_node, destination_node, \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path))))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- We initialize the queue with the starting node `5` and its path `[5]`.\n- We then enter a loop where we dequeue elements from the queue.\n- For each dequeued element, we check if it is the goal node `6`. If so, we return the path.\n- Otherwise, we explore its neighbors that haven't been visited yet, enqueue them with the updated path, and mark them as visited.\n- This process continues until we either find the goal or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n### Result:\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 5 to node 6 in the given graph. The output should be:\n```\nShortest path from 5 to 6 is: 5->7->6\n```"}]
