Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Algorithm\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Create a queue and enqueue the start node (1) along with an empty path list `[1]`.\n   - Create a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n\n2. **Process the Queue**:\n   - Dequeue the front element of the queue. Let's call this element `(current_node, path)`.\n   - If `current_node` is the end node (3), return the path.\n   - Mark `current_node` as visited.\n   - For each neighbor of `current_node` that has not been visited:\n     - Enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path (i.e., `path + [neighbor]`).\n\n3. **Repeat** until the queue is empty or the end node is found.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node and an empty path\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue the front element\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Process all neighbors of the current node\n        for edge in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in edge:\n                next_node = edge[1] if current_node == edge[0] else edge[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    # If there is no path from start to goal\n    return None\n\n# Given graph and nodes\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6]]}\nstart_node = 1\nend_node = 3\n\n# Find the shortest path using BFS\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, end_node)\nprint(\"The shortest path from node\", start_node, \"to node\", end_node, \"is:\", shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- We initialize a queue with the starting node and an empty path list.\n- We use a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n- We process each node by dequeuing it and checking its neighbors.\n- If a neighbor hasn't been visited, we add it to the queue with the updated path.\n- The process continues until we either find the goal node or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n### Output:\nWhen you run the code, it will output the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 in the given graph."}]
