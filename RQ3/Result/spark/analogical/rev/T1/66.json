If yes, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, mark the node as visited and enqueue all its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet, along with the updated path.\n\n### BFS Implementation\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node and its path\n    queue = deque([[start]])\n    # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Get the current path from the queue\n        path = queue.popleft()\n        # Get the last node from the current path\n        node = path[-1]\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if node == goal:\n            return \"->\".join(map(str, path))\n        \n        # Mark the node as visited\n        if node not in visited:\n            visited.add(node)\n            # Enqueue all adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet\n            for neighbor in graph['nodes']:\n                if [node, neighbor] in graph['edges'] or [neighbor, node] in graph['edges']:\n                    new_path = list(path)\n                    new_path.append(neighbor)\n                    queue.append(new_path)\n    \n    return None\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 7]]\n}\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 1\ndestination_node = 4\n\n# Find the shortest path using BFS\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `queue` is initialized with the starting node wrapped in a list (representing the path).\n   - `visited` is an empty set used to keep track of nodes that have already been processed.\n\n2. **BFS Process**:\n   - The algorithm processes each node by dequeuing the front of the queue.\n   - It checks if the current node is the goal. If so, it returns the path.\n   - If not, it marks the node as visited and enqueues all its unvisited neighbors with the updated path.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - The function returns the shortest path as a string formatted as required.\n\n### Shortest Path Calculation\n\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 in the provided graph.
