BFS is particularly well-suited for unweighted graphs and will explore all possible paths level by level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start with the start node (node 6) and mark it as visited.\n2. **Queue**: Use a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored along with the path taken to reach them.\n3. **Explore**: Dequeue a node, check its neighbors, and enqueue any unvisited neighbors while keeping track of the path.\n4. **Terminate**: Stop when the destination node (node 5) is reached or the queue is empty.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Keep track of explored nodes\n    explored = []\n    # Keep track of all the paths to be checked\n    queue = deque([[start]])\n    \n    # Return path if start is goal\n    if start == goal:\n        return [start]\n    \n    # Keep looping until all possible paths have been checked\n    while queue:\n        # Pop the first path from the queue\n        path = queue.popleft()\n        # Get the last node from the path\n        node = path[-1]\n        if node not in explored:\n            neighbours = [edge[1] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[0] == node] + \\\n                         [edge[0] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[1] == node]\n            # Go through all neighbour nodes, construct a new path and push it into the queue\n            for neighbour in neighbours:\n                new_path = list(path)\n                new_path.append(neighbour)\n                queue.append(new_path)\n                # Return path if neighbour is goal\n                if neighbour == goal:\n                    return new_path\n            # Mark node as explored\n            explored.append(node)\n    \n    # In case there's no path between the 2 nodes\n    return None\n\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 7], [1, 5], [1, 3], [2, 7], [3, 4], [4, 6]]}\nstart_node = 6\ndestination_node = 5\n\nresult = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize `explored` to keep track of visited nodes and `queue` to manage the BFS process. The initial path starts with the start node.\n2. **Loop**: We continue exploring until the queue is empty. For each path in the queue:\n   - We get the last node in the current path.\n   - If this node hasn't been explored yet, we find its neighbors.\n   - For each neighbor, we create a new path by adding the neighbor to the current path and add this new path to the queue.\n   - If we reach the goal node during this process, we return the path immediately.\n3. **Return**: If no path is found, we return `None`.\n\nRunning this code will give us the shortest path from node 6 to node 5 in the provided graph."}]
