Initialize a queue with the start node (0) and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n2. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the front node.\n   - If it is the destination node (1), backtrack to construct the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its neighbors that haven't been visited yet and mark them as visited.\n3. Return the constructed path.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        (current_node, path) = queue.popleft()\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))\n    \n    return None  # No path found\n\n# Constructing the graph as an adjacency list\ngraph = {i: [] for i in range(25)}\nfor edge in edges:\n    graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])\n    graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])\n\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 0, 1)\nprint(\"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Shortest Path in an Unweighted Graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 1 in the given unweighted graph.\n\n**Solution:**\n1.
