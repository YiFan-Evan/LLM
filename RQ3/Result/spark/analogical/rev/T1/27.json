BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step solution using BFS:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start with the start node (node 6) and mark it as visited.\n2. **Queue**: Use a queue to keep track of paths to be explored. Each element in the queue is a list representing a path.\n3. **Explore**: Dequeue the first path, get its last node, and enqueue all unvisited neighbors of that node along with the extended path.\n4. **Check Goal**: If the last node in any path is the end node (node 3), return that path as the shortest path.\n5. **Repeat**: Continue until the queue is empty or the goal node is found.\n\nLet's implement this in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Keep track of explored nodes\n    explored = []\n    # Keep track of all the paths to be checked\n    queue = deque([[start]])\n    \n    # Return path if start is goal\n    if start == goal:\n        return [start]\n    \n    # Keep looping until all possible paths have been checked\n    while queue:\n        # Pop the first path from the queue\n        path = queue.popleft()\n        # Get the last node from the path\n        node = path[-1]\n        if node not in explored:\n            neighbours = [edge[1] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[0] == node] + \\\n                         [edge[0] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[1] == node]\n            # Go through all neighbour nodes, construct a new path and push it into the queue\n            for neighbour in neighbours:\n                new_path = list(path)\n                new_path.append(neighbour)\n                queue.append(new_path)\n                # Return path if neighbour is goal\n                if neighbour == goal:\n                    return new_path\n            # Mark node as explored\n            explored.append(node)\n    \n    # In case there's no path between the 2 nodes\n    return None\n\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 6], [1, 4], [2, 4], [4, 5], [4, 7]]}\nstart_node = 6\nend_node = 3\n\nresult = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, end_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path from node 6 to node 3 is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, result)))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize `explored` to keep track of visited nodes and `queue` with the starting path `[start]`.\n2. **Loop**: We loop until the queue is empty.\n3. **Path Exploration**: For each path, we get the last node and find its neighbors. We then create new paths by adding these neighbors to the current path and add them to the queue.\n4. **Goal Check**: If any neighbor is the goal node, we return the path immediately.\n5. **Marking Nodes as Explored**: We mark nodes as explored once they are processed to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n\nRunning this code will give us the shortest path from node 6 to node 3 in the given graph."}]
