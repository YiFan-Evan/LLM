BFS is particularly well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start with the start node (node 2) and mark it as visited.\n2. **Queue**: Use a queue to keep track of nodes to explore, starting with the start node.\n3. **Path Tracking**: Maintain a dictionary to track the path taken to reach each node.\n4. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node, explore its neighbors, and enqueue them if they haven't been visited yet.\n5. **Termination**: Stop when the end node (node 5) is dequeued.\n\nLet's implement this algorithm:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node\n    queue = deque([start])\n    # Dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their paths\n    visited = {start: [start]}\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue a node from the front of the queue\n        current_node = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If we have reached the end node, return the path\n        if current_node == end:\n            return visited[current_node]\n        \n        # Get all adjacent nodes\n        neighbors = [edge[1] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[0] == current_node] + \\\n                    [edge[0] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[1] == current_node]\n        \n        for neighbor in neighbors:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                # Mark the neighbor as visited and record the path\n                visited[neighbor] = visited[current_node] + [neighbor]\n                # Enqueue the neighbor\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    # If there is no path from start to end\n    return None\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14],\n    'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 13], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 10], [4, 9], [5, 13], [6, 13], [7, 12], [7, 13], [8, 11], [8, 13], [8, 14]]\n}\n\n# Start and end nodes\nstart_node = 2\nend_node = 5\n\n# Find the shortest path using BFS\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, end_node)\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize the queue with the start node and a dictionary `visited` to keep track of the paths.\n2. **BFS Loop**: We loop until the queue is empty. In each iteration, we dequeue a node and check if it is the end node.\n3. **Neighbors**: For each node, we find its neighbors by checking both ends of each edge.\n4. **Visited Check**: If a neighbor hasn't been visited, we mark it as visited and record the path taken to reach it. Then, we enqueue the neighbor.\n5. **Return Path**: When we reach the end node, we return the recorded path. If no path exists, we return `None`.\n\nRunning this code will give us the shortest path from node 2 to node 5 in the provided graph."}]
