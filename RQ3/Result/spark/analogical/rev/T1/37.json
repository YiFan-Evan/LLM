If it is, we return the path.\n- If not, we mark the node as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors with the updated path.\n- This process continues until we either find the goal or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n### Result:\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 4 to node 3 in the given graph. The output should be:\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->2->3\n```"}]
