Each key in the dictionary represents a node, and the value is a list of nodes that are directly connected to the key node.\n- **BFS Algorithm**: We use a queue to perform BFS. For each node, we check its neighbors and add them to the queue if they haven't been visited yet. This ensures that we explore all possible paths level by level.\n- **Path Tracking**: We maintain a path list that keeps track of the sequence of nodes from the start node to the current node. When we reach the goal node, we return the path.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: `7->10->3`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 12], [1, 9], [1, 6], [2, 16], [3, 10], [4, 18], [4, 19], [4, 11], [5, 20], [5, 16], [6, 8], [6, 16], [7, 10], [7, 13], [8, 21], [9, 23], [11, 15], [12, 13], [14, 15], [15, 24], [16, 19], [17, 20], [19, 22]]} The end node: 5 The start node: 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 7 to node 5 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

The `visited` set keeps track of nodes we have already processed.\n- **BFS Loop**: We process each node by dequeuing it and checking its neighbors. If a neighbor hasn't been visited, we add it to the queue along with the updated path.\n- **Termination**: The loop continues until we either find the end node or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe shortest path from node 7 to node 5 in the given graph is: `7 -> 10 -> 3 -> 0 -> 5`"}]
