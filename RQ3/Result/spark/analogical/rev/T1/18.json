BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's how you can implement BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. **Initialize a queue** with the start node.\n2. **Track visited nodes** to avoid cycles and redundant work.\n3. **Explore each node** by adding its neighbors to the queue.\n4. **Check if the goal node** is reached during exploration.\n5. **Return the path** once the goal node is found.\n\nLet's write the code to achieve this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Keep track of explored nodes\n    explored = []\n    # Keep track of all the paths to be checked\n    queue = deque([[start]])\n    \n    # Return path if start is goal\n    if start == goal:\n        return [start]\n    \n    # Keep looping until all possible paths have been checked\n    while queue:\n        # Pop the first path from the queue\n        path = queue.popleft()\n        # Get the last node from the path\n        node = path[-1]\n        if node not in explored:\n            neighbours = [edge[1] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[0] == node] + \\\n                         [edge[0] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[1] == node]\n            # Go through all neighbour nodes, construct a new path and push it into the queue\n            for neighbour in neighbours:\n                new_path = list(path)\n                new_path.append(neighbour)\n                queue.append(new_path)\n                # Return path if neighbour is goal\n                if neighbour == goal:\n                    return new_path\n            # Mark node as explored\n            explored.append(node)\n    \n    # In case there's no path between the 2 nodes\n    return \"So sorry, but a connecting path doesn't exist\"\n\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 3], [0, 7], [2, 5], [3, 5], [4, 7], [5, 6]]}\nstart = 6\ngoal = 2\nprint(bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal))\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize `explored` to keep track of nodes that have already been visited to prevent cycles. The `queue` is initialized with the starting node wrapped in a list to represent the path taken so far.\n2. **Loop**: We continue processing until the queue is empty.\n3. **Path Extraction**: For each path extracted from the queue, we get the last node and check its neighbors.\n4. **Neighbor Check**: For each neighbor, we create a new path by appending the neighbor to the current path and add this new path to the queue. If the neighbor is the goal node, we return the path immediately.\n5. **Marking Nodes as Explored**: After exploring a node, we mark it as explored to avoid revisiting it.\n6. **No Path Case**: If the queue is exhausted without finding the goal, we return a message indicating no path exists.\n\n### Output:\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 6 to node 2 in the given graph."}]
