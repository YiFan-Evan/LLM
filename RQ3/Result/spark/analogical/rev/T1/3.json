Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n1. **Initialize**: Start with the start node (node 4).\n2. **Queue**: Use a queue to keep track of nodes to explore and their corresponding paths.\n3. **Visited Set**: Use a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. **Explore**: Dequeue a node, check if it is the end node (node 5), and if not, enqueue its neighbors that haven't been visited yet.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return '->'.join(map(str, path))\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for edge in graph['edges']:\n                if edge[0] == current_node:\n                    next_node = edge[1]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n                elif edge[1] == current_node:\n                    next_node = edge[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return \"No path found\"\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 5], [1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]}\n\n# Define the start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 4\ndestination_node = 5\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize the queue with the start node `(4, [4])` and an empty set for visited nodes.\n2. **Loop**: We loop until the queue is empty.\n3. **Dequeue**: We dequeue the first element from the queue. If the current node is the goal node (5), we return the path.\n4. **Mark as Visited**: Mark the current node as visited.\n5. **Enqueue Neighbors**: For each edge connected to the current node, add the neighboring node to the queue if it hasn't been visited yet.\n6. **Return Path**: If we reach the goal node, we return the path; otherwise, we continue exploring.\n\nRunning this code will give us the shortest path from node 4 to node 5 in the given graph."}]
