Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Algorithm\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Create a queue and enqueue the start node (1) along with an empty path list `[1]`.\n   - Create a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n\n2. **Process the Queue**:\n   - Dequeue the front element of the queue. Let's call this element `(current_node, path)`.\n   - If `current_node` is the end node (2), return the path.\n   - Mark `current_node` as visited.\n   - For each neighbor of `current_node` that has not been visited:\n     - Enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path (i.e., `path + [neighbor]`).\n\n3. **Repeat** until the queue is empty or the end node is found.\n\n### Implementation in Python\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node and an empty path\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal node\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Iterate over all edges to find neighbors\n        for edge in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in edge:\n                next_node = edge[1] if edge[0] == current_node else edge[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    # Return None if there is no path from start to goal\n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 5], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n}\n\n# Start and end nodes\nstart_node = 1\nend_node = 2\n\n# Finding the shortest path from node 1 to node 2\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, end_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path from node 1 to node 2 is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- We initialize a queue with the starting node and an empty path.\n- We use a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n- We process each node by exploring its neighbors and adding them to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\n- When we reach the goal node, we return the path taken to get there.\n- If the queue is exhausted without finding the goal node, we return `None` indicating no path exists.\n\n### Output\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 1 to node 2 in the provided graph."}]
