Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution Using BFS\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Start with node 2.\n   - Use a queue to manage nodes to explore.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Track the path taken to reach each node.\n\n2. **Algorithm**:\n   - Enqueue the start node (2) along with its path.\n   - Dequeue a node and check if it is the goal node (1).\n   - If it is, return the path.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors along with the updated path.\n   - Mark the current node as visited.\n   - Repeat until the queue is empty or the goal node is found.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 7], [3, 5], [5, 6]]\n}\n\n# Finding the shortest path from node 2 to node 1\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 2, 1)\nprint(\"Shortest path from node 2 to node 1 is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize the queue with the starting node `2` and its path `[2]`. The `visited` set keeps track of nodes that have been processed.\n- **Queue Processing**: We process each node by dequeuing it and checking if it matches the goal node `1`. If it does, we return the path.\n- **Neighbors Processing**: For each node, we find its neighbors using the edges list. If a neighbor hasn't been visited, we add it to the queue with the updated path.\n- **Termination**: The loop continues until either the queue is empty (no path found) or the goal node is reached.\n\n### Result:\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 2 to node 1 in the given graph."}]
