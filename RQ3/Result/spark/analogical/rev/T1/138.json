Record the parent of each visited node.\n   - If the destination node (7) is reached, stop the search.\n\n3. **Reconstruct the Path**:\n   - Starting from the destination node, trace back to the start node using the parent records.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Initialize BFS\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 5], [0, 13], [0, 14], [1, 9], [2, 7], [2, 10], [3, 10], [4, 11], [4, 5], [6, 14], [8, 11], [9, 14], [12, 14]]}\nstart_node = 4\ndestination_node = 7\n\n# Create adjacency list from edges\nadjacency_list = {node: [] for node in graph['nodes']}\nfor edge in graph['edges']:\n    adjacency_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])\n    adjacency_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])\n\n# BFS initialization\nqueue = deque([start_node])\nvisited = {start_node: None}  # Dictionary to store visited nodes and their parents\n```\n\n### Step 2: Perform BFS\n```python\nwhile queue:\n    current_node = queue.popleft()\n    \n    if current_node == destination_node:\n        break\n    \n    for neighbor in adjacency_list[current_node]:\n        if neighbor not in visited:\n            visited[neighbor] = current_node\n            queue.append(neighbor)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Reconstruct the Path\n```python\nif destination_node in visited:\n    path = []\n    step = destination_node\n    while step is not None:\n        path.append(step)\n        step = visited[step]\n    path.reverse()\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, path)))\nelse:\n    print(\"No path found\")\n```\n\n### Full Code\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 5], [0, 13], [0, 14], [1, 9], [2, 7], [2, 10], [3, 10], [4, 11], [4, 5], [6, 14], [8, 11], [9, 14], [12, 14]]}\nstart_node = 4\ndestination_node = 7\n\n# Create adjacency list from edges\nadjacency_list = {node: [] for node in graph['nodes']}\nfor edge in graph['edges']:\n    adjacency_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])\n    adjacency_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])\n\n# BFS initialization\nqueue = deque([start_node])\nvisited = {start_node: None"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 5], [0, 13], [0, 14], [1, 9], [2, 7], [2, 10], [3, 10], [4, 11], [4, 5], [6, 14], [8, 11], [9, 14], [12, 14]]} The end node: 7 The start node: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 4 to node 7 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).
