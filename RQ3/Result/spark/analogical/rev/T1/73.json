Start at node 1.\n2. Use recursion to explore each node depth first.\n3. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n4. Collect all paths that reach node 2.\n\n```python\ndef dfs_all_paths(graph, start, goal, path=[], paths=[]):\n    path = path + [start]\n    if start == goal:\n        paths.append(path)\n    else:\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if start in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == start else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in path:\n                    dfs_all_paths(graph, next_node, goal, path, paths)\n    return paths\n\n# Find all paths\nall_paths = dfs_all_paths(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"All paths using DFS:\")\nfor p in all_paths:\n    print(\"->\".join(map(str, p)))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Finding the Shortest Path with Dijkstra's Algorithm\n**Description:** Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 2 in the provided graph. Note that this is more applicable to weighted graphs, but we will assume equal weights for simplicity.\n\n**Solution:**\n1. Assign a distance value to each node; initialize the starting node as 0 and others as infinity.\n2. Use a priority queue to always expand the least cost node first.\n3. Update the distance values of neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.\n4.

Here's how you can do it step by step:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Algorithm\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Create a queue and enqueue the start node (1) along with an empty path list `[1]`.\n   - Create a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n\n2. **Process the Queue**:\n   - Dequeue the front element of the queue. Let's call this element `(current_node, path)`.\n   - If `current_node` is the end node (2), return the path.\n   - Mark `current_node` as visited.\n   - For each neighbor of `current_node` that has not been visited:\n     - Enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path (i.e., `path + [neighbor]`).\n\n3. **Repeat** until the queue is empty or the end node is found.\n\nHere's the Python code implementing this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n                if current_node in neighbor:\n                    next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                    if next_node not in visited:\n                        queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n    \n    return None\n\n# Graph definition\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [3, 4], [4, 5], [6, 7]]\n}\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 1\ndestination_node = 2\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path using BFS:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - We initialize a queue with a tuple containing the start node and the initial path `[1]`.\n   - We also initialize a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes.\n\n2. **Processing the Queue**:\n   - We dequeue the front element of the queue.\n   - If the current node is the goal node (2), we return the path.\n   - Otherwise, we mark the current node as visited.\n   - We then check all neighbors of the current node. If a neighbor hasn't been visited, we enqueue it with the updated path.\n\n3. **Output**:\n   - The function returns the shortest path from node 1 to node 2.\n\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 1 to node 2 in the provided graph."}]
