If a neighbor has not been visited, it is marked as visited, its parent is set, and it is added to the queue.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the destination node is reached, the path is reconstructed by tracing back from the destination to the start using the parent information stored in the `visited` dictionary.\n\n### Shortest Path:\nThe output will be the shortest path from node 6 to node 13 in the format specified."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 11], [1, 10], [2, 10], [4, 7], [4, 12], [5, 8], [5, 9], [5, 12], [6, 11], [6, 14], [7, 10], [11, 12], [12, 13]]} The end node: 13 The start node: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 6 to node 13 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS).

We also initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n2. **BFS Traversal**: We dequeue elements from the queue, check if the current node is the end node, and if so, return the path. Otherwise, we mark the current node as visited and enqueue its unvisited neighbors with the updated path.\n3. **Reconstruct Path**: The function returns the shortest path when the end node is reached. If no path exists, it returns `None`.\n\nRunning this code will give you the shortest path from node 6 to node 13 in the provided graph."}]
