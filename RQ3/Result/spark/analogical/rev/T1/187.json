Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to apply BFS to this problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Algorithm\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Create a queue and enqueue the start node (12) along with an empty path list `[12]`.\n   - Create a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n\n2. **Process the Queue**:\n   - Dequeue the front element of the queue. Let's call it `(current_node, path)`.\n   - If `current_node` is the destination node (1), return the path as the shortest path.\n   - Mark `current_node` as visited.\n   - For each neighbor of `current_node` that has not been visited:\n     - Enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path (i.e., `path + [neighbor]`).\n\n3. **Repeat** until the queue is empty or the destination node is found.\n\n4. **Return**:\n   - If the queue is empty and the destination node was not reached, there is no path from the start node to the end node.\n\n### Applying BFS to the Given Graph\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node and an empty path\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue the front element\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal node\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Process all neighbors of the current node\n        for edge in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in edge:\n                neighbor = edge[1] if edge[0] == current_node else edge[0]\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))\n                    visited.add(neighbor)\n    \n    # If there's no path found\n    return None\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 20], [0, 4], [1, 22], [1, 11], [2, 11], [2, 18], [3, 4], [3, 11], [5, 14], [6, 13], [6, 22], [7, 12], [7, 23], [7, 15], [8, 23], [9, 21], [10, 14], [10, 24], [14, 15], [15, 16], [15, 18], [16, 19], [17, 18], [18, 21]]\n}\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 12\ndestination_node = 1\n\n# Find the shortest path using BFS\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"The shortest path from node\", start_node, \"to node\", destination_node, \"is:\", shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n- We initialize a queue with the starting node and an empty path.\n- We use a set to keep track of visited nodes to prevent revisiting them.\n- We process each node by exploring its neighbors and adding unvisited neighbors to the queue with the updated path.\n- The"}]
