To find its indefinite integral, we can use integration by parts. Let's denote the function as \\(f(x) = (1 + e^x) \\ln(x)\\). We can break it into two parts for integration by parts:\n\n1. \\(u = \\ln(x)\\) which implies \\(du = \\frac{1}{x}dx\\)\n2. \\(dv = (1 + e^x)dx\\) which implies \\(v = x + e^x\\)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula \\(\\int u \\, dv = uv - \\int v \\, du\\), we get:\n\n\\[\n\\int (1 + e^x) \\ln(x) \\, dx = (\\ln(x))(x + e^x) - \\int (x + e^x) \\frac{1}{x} \\, dx\n\\]\n\nSimplifying further:\n\n\\[\n= \\ln(x)(x + e^x) - \\left(\\int \\frac{x}{x} \\, dx + \\int \\frac{e^x}{x} \\, dx\\right)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n= \\ln(x)(x + e^x) - (x + \\int \\frac{e^x}{x} \\, dx)\n\\]\n\nThe integral \\(\\int \\frac{e^x}{x} \\, dx\\) does not have an elementary antiderivative and is known as the exponential integral function, denoted as \\(\\text{Ei}(x)\\).
