Sewers - Rats are often associated with sewers, but if they were hiding in the house, this might not be the most likely place unless the house has direct access to sewers.\nB. Laboratory - This is an unlikely place for rats to hide unless it's a specific type of laboratory designed for animal testing or study.\nC. Basement - Basements are common areas where rats might hide because they offer shelter and are less frequented by humans.\nD. Clinic - Similar to a laboratory, clinics are not typical hiding places for rats unless they are animal clinics or have poor sanitation.\nE. Cellar - A cellar is similar to a basement and would also be a likely place for rats to hide.\n\nConsidering the options provided, both C (basement) and E (cellar) are plausible answers. However, if we must choose one based on the context given, \"The rats were hiding in the house,\" the more commonly expected answer would be:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **C. basement**"}]
