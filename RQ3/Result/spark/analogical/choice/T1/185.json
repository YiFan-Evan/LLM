The options are vengeance, going to prison, joy, afraid, and terrible.\n\n**Solution Explanation:**\n\n1. **Understanding Emotions in Context:** Killing people is a grave act that generally evokes negative emotions such as fear, sadness, or anger. It is also associated with legal consequences like going to prison.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Option:**\n   - A. Vengeance: This is an emotion that could be felt by someone who has killed another person, especially if it was done in retaliation. However, it is not the primary focus of this question.\n   - B. Going to prison: This is a legal consequence rather than an emotion. Therefore, it does not fit the category of emotions.\n   - C. Joy: This is a positive emotion and is generally not associated with killing people. It is considered inappropriate and abnormal to feel joy from causing harm or death to others.\n   - D. Afraid: Fear or being afraid is a common emotion that might be felt after committing such a serious act, due to potential legal repercussions or moral guilt.\n   - E. Terrible: This describes the emotional state of feeling very upset or distressed, which is a likely reaction to killing someone.\n\n3. **Conclusion:** Among the given options, \"joy\" is the emotion that should not be caused by killing people, as it is a positive emotion that contrasts with the gravity and negativity of the act.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. joy."}]
