Therefore, when the bald eagle flew from Mount St. Helens to the Puget Sound, it would have been flying within Washington state.\n\nThe other options provided (Utah, Northern California, the Desert, and the Pacific Northwest) are not directly related to the flight path described in the question. The Pacific Northwest is a broader region that includes parts of Washington, Oregon, and sometimes British Columbia in Canada, but it's too vague to be the correct answer for this specific scenario.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. washington state"}]
