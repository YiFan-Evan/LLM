(Since the reason-word \"afro_seminole_creole\" is associated with trees, and the reason-word \"crab_cactus\" is associated with fruit, and the reason-word \"math_problem\" is associated with logical problem-solving, the model has likely learned that apples form on a specific part of the apple tree (i.e. the trunk) through logical deduction based on its knowledge of trees and fruit.
