Punctured - This would be true because if there is a hole in the basketball, it has indeed been punctured.\nB. Popular in America - This statement is irrelevant to the condition of the basketball having a hole.\nC. Full of air - This would not be true because if there is a hole in the basketball, the air would escape, and it would not be full of air.\nD. Gone - This does not apply to the condition of the basketball; it is still present even with a hole.\nE. Round - This would still be true because despite having a hole, the basketball retains its general shape, which is round.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC. full of air"}]
