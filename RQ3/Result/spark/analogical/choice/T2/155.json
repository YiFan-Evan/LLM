We need to identify an aspect that makes raising a baby difficult due to their inability to perform certain actions.\n\n**Options Analysis:**\n\nA. **Talk nonsense** - Babies often babble or talk nonsense as they are learning to communicate. This can be challenging for parents as they try to understand the baby's needs and wants. However, this is more about communication rather than a direct challenge in caregiving.\n\nB. **Bring joy** - This option is positive and does not align with the idea of making raising a baby difficult. It is more about the benefits of having a baby rather than the challenges.\n\nC. **Boy or girl** - The gender of the baby doesn't inherently make raising them more difficult. This option is irrelevant to the challenges of baby-rearing.\n\nD. **Learn to walk** - Learning to walk is a developmental milestone that takes time and patience. It can indeed be challenging for parents as they need to constantly watch over the baby to ensure their safety during this learning process. This aligns with the idea of causing problems for parents due to the baby's inability to perform certain actions.\n\nE. **Arrive early** - This option seems unrelated to the difficulties of raising a baby. It could refer to premature birth, but the question doesn't specify any health-related issues.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nBased on the analysis, the most appropriate answer that aligns with the challenges of raising a baby due to their inability to perform certain actions is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}]
