Hair loss, or alopecia, is a common concern for many males as they age, leading to a receding hairline.\nD. grow in ear - This option is clearly incorrect as it does not relate to hair on the scalp.\nE. thin out - While this option can describe a condition that may lead to a receding hairline, it is not as specific as \"fall out\" in describing the process of hair loss.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. fall out"}]
