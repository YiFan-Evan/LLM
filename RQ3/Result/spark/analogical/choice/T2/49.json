Panic - A feeling of intense fear or anxiety.\nB. Solitude - The state of being alone, especially when one desires to be alone.\nC. Solitary - Alone, especially when this is by choice or preference.\nD. Alone - Without anyone else near; having no one else with one.\nE. Small group - A group that has few members.\n\nNow, let's consider the context of the question: Despite the large crowds, how did the depressed man feel?\n\nThe key phrase here is \"despite the large crowds,\" which indicates a contrast between the number of people around and the man's internal feelings.\n\nOption A, \"panic,\" might be a possible feeling in a crowd for some people, but it doesn't necessarily indicate a feeling of isolation or loneliness.\nOption B, \"solitude,\" implies a desire to be alone, which doesn't quite fit the context of feeling isolated in a crowd.\nOption C, \"solitary,\" means alone, but it often carries a connotation of choice or preference, which doesn't seem to align with the idea of being depressed in a crowd.\nOption D, \"alone,\" directly addresses the feeling of isolation, even when surrounded by others.\nOption E, \"small group,\" does not describe an emotional state and is not relevant to the question.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. alone."}]
