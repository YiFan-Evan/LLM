It is closely related to illness but refers to a place rather than a state of being.\nE. sick person - This directly refers to someone who is ill, which is in line with the man's fear of illness.\n\nGiven the above analysis, the most appropriate answer would be:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. sick person."}]
