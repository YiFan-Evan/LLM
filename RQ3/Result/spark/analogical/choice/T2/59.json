Let's evaluate each option:\n\n- **A. demonstration**: This would likely be a hands-on or visual presentation of how the computer works, which could help her understand it better.\n- **B. apartment**: This has no direct relation to learning about computers.\n- **C. school**: While schools offer education, they are not specifically tailored to teaching someone how to use a computer in this context.\n- **D. facebook**: This is a social media platform and does not provide structured learning about computers.\n- **E. classroom**: A classroom setting typically implies a learning environment where one can receive instruction on a variety of topics, including computers.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most appropriate option for someone looking to learn more about computers would be a setting that provides direct instruction or demonstration. Between \"demonstration\" and \"classroom,\" both are plausible, but a \"demonstration\" is more directly related to showing someone how something works, which aligns well with the goal of understanding a computer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **A. demonstration**."}]
