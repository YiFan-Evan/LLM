Move 15 steps counter-clockwise from the ping-pong ball:\n   - Moving 15 steps counter-clockwise from the ping-pong ball (position 9) means moving backwards 15 steps around the circle.\n   - This can be calculated as \\(9 - 15 = -6\\).\n   - To find the positive equivalent position, add 20 to -6: \\(20 + (-6) = 14\\).\n   - So, you now end up at the scoreboard.\n4. Move 12 steps counter-clockwise from the scoreboard:\n   - Moving 12 steps counter-clockwise from the scoreboard (position 14):\n   - \\(14 - 12 = 2\\).\n   - You end up at the duck.\n5.
