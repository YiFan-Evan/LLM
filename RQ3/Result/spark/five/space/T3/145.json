Moving 16 steps in a clockwise direction from the goldfish (position 18) takes us to dot number 4 (since 18 + 16 = 34 and 34 modulo 20 = 4).\n2. Moving 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from dot number 4 takes us to dot number 20 (since 4 - 4 = 0 and 0 modulo 20 = 20).\n3. Moving 13 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from dot number 20 takes us to dot number 7 (since 20 - 13 = 7 and 7 modulo 20 = 7).\n4. Moving 4 steps in a clockwise direction from dot number 7 takes us to dot number 11 (since 7 + 4 = 11 and 11 modulo 20 = 11).\n\nSo, starting from the goldfish and following these movements, you will find yourself at the dot where there is an infant bed."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Starting from the goldfish (position 18), move around the ring by 32 steps in a clockwise direction. Since 32 % 20 = 12, this takes us to dot number 6 (18 + 12 = 30; 30 % 20 = 6).\n2. Move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from dot number 6. This means moving 20 - 8 = 12 steps in a clockwise direction from dot number 6, which leads to dot number 18 (6 + 12 = 18).\n3. Move around the ring by 26 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from dot number 18. This means moving 20 - 26 = 14 steps in a clockwise direction from dot number 18, which leads to dot number 2 (18 + 14 = 32; 32 % 20 = 2).\n4. Move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction from dot number 2. This takes us to dot number 10 (2 + 8 = 10).\n\nSo, starting from the goldfish and following these movements, you will find yourself at the dot where there is a maraca."}]
