Since the total number of dots is 20, and moving 6 steps CCW brings us to 18 - 6 = 12 steps CW from the start.\n3. **Second Movement - Clockwise (CW) by 2 Steps**:\n   - From the position reached in step 2, which is 12 steps CW from the start, moving 2 steps CW brings us to 12 + 2 = 14 steps CW from the start.\n4. **Third Movement - Counter-clockwise (CCW) by 5 Steps**:\n   - From the current position at 14 steps CW, moving 5 steps CCW brings us to 14 - 5 = 9 steps CW from the start.\n5. **Fourth Movement - Counter-clockwise (CCW) by 10 Steps**:\n   - From the position reached in step 4, which is 9 steps CW, moving 10 steps CCW brings us to 9 - 10 = -1 steps CW from the start. Since moving CCW beyond the starting point loops us back around the circle, -1 steps CW is equivalent to 19 steps CW from the start (as there are 20 dots total).\n\nNow, let's identify what item is located at the position 19 steps CW from the start:\n\nFrom the initial list, counting the items CW from the sunglasses:\n1.

Alaskan Malamute\n13. Fire salamander\n14. Teddy bear\n15. Oxygen mask\n16. Split-rail fence\n17. Pan flute\n18. Shower curtain\n19. Sea lion\n20.
