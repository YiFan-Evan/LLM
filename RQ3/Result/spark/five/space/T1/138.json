Let's assume the breakwater is at position \\( x \\). After 8 steps counter-clockwise, we land at position \\( x - 8 \\) (adjusting for the loop using modulo arithmetic, \\((x - 8) \\% 20\\)).\n4. **Next Movement**: 16 steps clockwise.\n5. **Landing Point**: From the new position, we move 16 steps clockwise. Adding 16 to the current position gives us \\((x - 8 + 16) \\% 20\\). Simplifying, we get \\((x + 8) \\% 20\\).\n6. **Next Movement**: 7 steps counter-clockwise.\n7. **Landing Point**: Again adjusting for the loop, we subtract 7 from the current position: \\((x + 8 - 7) \\% 20\\).
