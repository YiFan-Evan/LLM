This means going to the next element, which is the mud turtle (7th element).\n\n3. **Second Move**: Move 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction from the mud turtle. Counter-clockwise means moving back to the previous element, which is the snow leopard (6th element).\n\n4. **Third Move**: Move 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the snow leopard. Counting 9 steps back from the 6th element wraps around the circle and lands you at the traffic light (10th element).\n\n5. **Fourth Move**: Move 3 steps in a clockwise direction from the traffic light. This takes you to the bolete (11th element).\n\n6. **Fifth Move**: Move 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the bolete. Counting 7 steps back from the 11th element brings you to the soup bowl (4th element).\n\n7. **Sixth Move**: Move 6 steps in a clockwise direction from the soup bowl.
