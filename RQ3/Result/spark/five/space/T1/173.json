The actual object \"sunglasses\" is not relevant to finding the final position.\n\n### Step 2: Locate the Shower Curtain\nWe need to find the shower curtain in the list of items given:\n- sunglasses (index 0)\n- wolf spider (index 1)\n- mashed potato (index 2)\n- jeep (index 3)\n- Bluetick Coonhound (index 4)\n- white-headed capuchin (index 5)\n- filing cabinet (index 6)\n- sea cucumber (index 7)\n- screwdriver (index 8)\n- ski (index 9)\n- Egyptian Mau (index 10)\n- Alaskan Malamute (index 11)\n- fire salamander (index 12)\n- teddy bear (index 13)\n- oxygen mask (index 14)\n- split-rail fence (index 15)\n- pan flute (index 16)\n- shower curtain (index 17)\n- sea lion (index 18)\n- fountain (index 19)\n\nThe shower curtain is located at index 17.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate Movements\n1. **Move 6 steps counter-clockwise from the shower curtain (index 17):**\n   Counter-clockwise means moving backwards. So, \\(17 - 6 = 11\\).\n\n2. **Move 2 steps clockwise from index 11:**\n   Clockwise means moving forwards. So, \\(11 + 2 = 13\\).\n\n3. **Move 5 steps counter-clockwise from index 13:**\n   Counter-clockwise again: \\(13 - 5 = 8\\).\n\n4. **Move 10 steps counter-clockwise from index 8:**\n   Counter-clockwise once more: \\(8 - 10 = -2\\). Since the path is circular and consists of 20 dots, wrap around by adding 20: \\( -2 + 20 = 18\\).\n\n### Final Position\nYou end up at index 18, which corresponds to the sea lion.\n\nTherefore, after all these movements, you will find the **sea lion**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
