Then, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. Moving counter-clockwise from the bell-cot takes you to the barrette. Next, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. Counting 4 steps from the barrette in a clockwise direction, you land on the military uniform. After that, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. Counting 8 steps from the military uniform in a clockwise direction, you land on the tailed frog.
