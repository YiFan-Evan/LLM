Since you are on the sixth element (the umbrella), counting 18 steps counter-clockwise means moving back 18 - 6 = 12 steps (because passing the starting point requires subtracting one full circle).\n\n4. **Second Move**: After completing the first move, you then move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nLet's calculate these moves:\n\n- First move: 18 steps counter-clockwise from the umbrella brings us to the 12th element before the umbrella. Counting backwards from the umbrella:\n  - Umbrella (6th element)\n  - Doormat (5th element)\n  - Megalith (4th element)\n  - Police van (3rd element)\n  - Egyptian Mau (2nd element)\n  - Football helmet (1st element, which is the top position)\n  - Toy terrier (20th element, continuing counter-clockwise)\n  - Polaroid camera (19th element)\n  - Three-toed sloth (18th element)\n  - Teapot (17th element)\n  - Hermit crab (16th element)\n  - Chainsaw (15th element)\n  - Chain (14th element)\n  - Great white shark (13th element)\n  - Komodo dragon (12th element)\n\n  So, after 18 steps counter-clockwise from the umbrella, you land at the Komodo dragon.\n\n- Second move: Moving 2 steps further counter-clockwise from the Komodo dragon:\n  - Komodo dragon (12th element)\n  - Great white shark (13th element)\n  - Chain (14th element)\n\nTherefore, after following all the instructions, you will find the **chain**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
