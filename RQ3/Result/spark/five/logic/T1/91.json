You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Start with the known fact that Fae is a grimpus. This is stated directly as (12).\n\n2. From (3), we know that everything that is orange, blue, or a rompus is a grimpus. Since Fae is a grimpus, it implies Fae could be orange, blue, or a rompus. However, this does not directly help us prove that Fae is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus.\n\n3. Considering Fae is also a shumpus (from (13)), and looking at (8), we find that everything sour, bitter, or a shumpus is an impus. Therefore, Fae being a shumpus means Fae is an impus.\n\n4. Now, let's consider the properties of being a yumpus. According to (1), everything that is large, small, or a yumpus is a wumpus. And from (4), everything that is kind, angry, or a grimpus is a yumpus. Since Fae is a grimpus (from (12)), Fae must also be a yumpus.\n\n5. With Fae established as a yumpus, we now refer back to (6), which states everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus. Since Fae is a yumpus, it follows that Fae must be either luminous, metallic, or both.\n\nTherefore, based on the logical deduction from the given premises, we have proven that Fae is either luminous, metallic, or a yumpus, satisfying the proof obligation (14)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
