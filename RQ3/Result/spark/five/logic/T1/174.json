Since Sally is also stated to be a shumpus in Premise 3, it follows that she is a vumpus.\n\nNow, using Premise 9 where each vumpus is a tumpus, we can deduce that Sally is also a tumpus because she has been established as a vumpus.\n\nSince Sally is a tumpus, she must be a brimpus according to Premise 4, which states that everything that is a shumpus or a rompus or a tumpus is a brimpus. This conclusion supports our earlier deduction from Premise 12.\n\nHowever, from Premise 13, we know that Sally is not a vumpus, which contradicts our previous deduction based on Premises 3, 11, and 9.

Here's how we can approach this:\n\n1. **Premise Analysis**:\n   - Premise (1) states that Numpuses are yumpuses.\n   - Premise (2) states that each dumpus is a shumpus.\n   - Premise (3) states that Sally is a shumpus.\n   - Premise (4) states that anything that is a shumpus, rompus, or tumpus is a brimpus.\n   - Premise (5) states that anything that is a grimpus, gorpus, or rompus is a vumpus.\n   - Premise (6) states that every grimpus is a lorpus.\n   - Premise (7) states that wumpuses are yumpuses.\n   - Premise (8) states that anything that is a grimpus, gorpus, or rompus is a lorpus.\n   - Premise (9) states that each vumpus is a tumpus.\n   - Premise (10) states that wumpuses are rompuses, grimpuses, and vumpuses.\n   - Premise (11) states that every shumpus is a vumpus.\n   - Premise (12) states that Sally is a yumpus, a shumpus, and a jompus.\n   - Premise (13) states that Sally is a dumpus and Sally is a numpus and Sally is not a vumpus.\n\n2. **Logical Deduction**:\n   - From Premise (3), we know Sally is a shumpus.\n   - From Premise (4), since Sally is a shumpus, she must also be a brimpus.\n   - From Premise (11), since Sally is a shumpus, she must also be a vumpus.\n   - However, Premise (13) directly contradicts this by stating Sally is not a vumpus. This creates an inconsistency in the premises.\n\n3. **Handling the Inconsistency**:\n   - The contradiction between Premise (11) and Premise (13) regarding whether Sally is a vumpus means that the premises provided cannot be used to definitively prove or disprove whether Sally is a wumpus. The contradiction prevents us from drawing a valid conclusion based on these premises alone.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the inconsistency in the premises, we cannot logically deduce whether Sally is a wumpus or not.
