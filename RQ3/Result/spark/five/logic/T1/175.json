You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

(Premise 5)\n8. Each wumpus is not loud. (Premise 8)\n14. Brimpuses are numpuses. (Premise 16)\n18. Each jompus is not small. (Premise 18)\n19. Impuses are fruity. (Premise 19)\n23. Sally is a brimpus. (Premise 23)\n24. Sally is a shumpus. (Premise 24)\n\nNow, let's use these premises step by step:\n\n1. From Premise 24, \"Sally is a shumpus.\"\n2. From Premise 1, \"Each shumpus is an impus,\" so \"Sally is an impus\" (from step 1).\n3. From Premise 5, \"Shumpuses are wumpuses,\" so \"Sally is a wumpus\" (from step 1).\n4. From Premise 8, \"Each wumpus is not loud,\" so \"Sally is not loud\" (from step 3).\n5. From Premise 18, \"Each jompus is not small,\" but we don't know if Sally is a jompus yet. However, since Sally is a brimpus (from Premise 23), and every jompus is a lorpus (Premise 14), we can infer that Sally is also a lorpus.\n6. From Premise 14, \"Brimpuses are numpuses,\" so \"Sally is a numpus\" (from step 23).\n7. From Premise 18, \"Each jompus is not small,\" and we already know from step 5 that each jompus is a lorpus, thus \"Sally is not small\" because Sally is a jompus (from step 5).\n\nTherefore, by combining these steps, we conclude:\nSally is not small.\n\nThus, the proof obligation (25) \"Sally is not small\" is proven using the given premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
