You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Here's how you can approach it:\n\n1. **Understanding the Premises**:\n   - Premise (2) states that everything which is amenable, mean, angry, aggressive, and an impus is a dumpus.\n   - Premise (3) states that everything which is muffled, loud, discordant, melodic, and a dumpus is a lempus.\n   - From Premises (6), (9), (11), (12), (13), (14), (16), and (17), we know Wren has all these characteristics: amenable, mean, angry, aggressive, muffled, melodic, bright, loud, discordant, and an impus.\n\n2. **Applying Premise (2)**:\n   - Since Wren is amenable, mean, angry, aggressive, and an impus (as per Premises (6), (9), (12), (13), (16)), by Premise (2), it follows that Wren is a dumpus.\n\n3. **Using Intermediate Conclusion with Premise (3)**:\n   - Now that we have established Wren as a dumpus, we can apply Premise (3). Since Wren is also muffled, loud, discordant, melodic, and a dumpus (as per Premises (11), (17), (10), (7), and from the conclusion of Step 2), by Premise (3), it follows that Wren is a lempus.\n\n4. **Combining All Traits for Final Proof**:\n   - We already know from the above steps that Wren is muffled, loud, discordant, melodic, and a dumpus. Therefore, putting this together, Wren indeed fits the description \"muffled and loud and discordant and melodic and a dumpus.\"\n\nThus, using the chain of logical deduction through the given premises, we conclude that Wren is indeed \"muffled and loud and discordant and melodic and a dumpus,\" which proves statement (18)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
