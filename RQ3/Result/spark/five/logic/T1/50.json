Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a yumpus. (Premise 12)\n13. Max is a vumpus and a dumpus and a jompus. (Premise 13)\n14. Max is a shumpus, a lempus, and a numpus. (Premise 14)\n15. Max is a zumpus. (Premise 15)\n16. Max is a tumpus. (Premise 16)\n\nFrom Premise 14, we know that Max is a lempus. Using Premise 6, we can deduce that:\n- Max is a gorpus (since each lempus is a gorpus).\n\nFrom Premise 7, we also know that:\n- Max is a gorpus.\n\nNow, using Premise 11 and Premise 4, we have:\n- Max is a wumpus.\n- Max is a zumpus.\n\nFrom Premise 3, since Max is a zumpus, a wumpus, and a gorpus, we can conclude that:\n- Max is a vumpus.\n\nFrom Premise 13, we know that:\n- Max is a jompus.\n\nUsing Premise 9, we can deduce that:\n- Max is a yumpus (since jompuses are yumpuses).\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of Premise 12:\n- Everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a yumpus.\n\nSince Max is a zumpus (from Premise 15) and a tumpus (from Premise 16), if Max were also an impus, then according to Premise 12, Max would be a yumpus. However, this would create a contradiction because we already know from Premise 1 that each lempus is not a yumpus, and from Premise 14 we know that Max is a lempus.\n\nTherefore, to avoid contradiction, we must conclude that Max cannot be an impus. This aligns with the goal of proving that Max is not an impus. Thus, we can state:\n\nMax is not an impus."}]
