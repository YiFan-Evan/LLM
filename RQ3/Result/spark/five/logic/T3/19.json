According to premise (7), rompuses are vumpuses and gorpuses, so since Sally is a rompus, she must also be a gorpus.\n\nNow, let's see if there is any connection between gorpuses and gorpuses. From premise (3), every gorpus is a yumpus and a wumpus. However, this only tells us what properties a gorpus has but does not tell us how to become a gorpus.\n\nLet's try another angle. Since Sally is a rompus (from premise (10)) and rompuses are vumpuses (from premise (7)), then Sally is also a vumpus. According to premise (6), vumpuses are grimpuses and lorpuses, which means Sally is also a grimpus and a lorpus.\n\nHowever, none of these connections directly lead us to proving that Sally is a gorpus. We need to find a link between Sally being a rompus or vumpus and being a gorpus.\n\nLooking at premise (3), it states that every gorpus is a yumpus and a wumpus, but it doesn't provide information on how to become a gorpus. We need to find a property that connects Sally to gorpus through the given premises.\n\nUnfortunately, based on the given premises, there is no direct or indirect path that links Sally to being a gorpus.
