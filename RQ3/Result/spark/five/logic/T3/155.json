Rex is a yumpus.\n\nNow let's try to deduce whether Rex can be a lempus based on these premises:\n\n- From (1), Rex is a lorpus.\n- From (11), all lempuses are wumpuses.\n- From (2) and (11), if Rex were a lempus, then he would also be a wumpus, but this doesn't directly contradict any of the given premises yet.\n- From (5), all wumpuses are tumpuses. Since Rex is already established as a dumpus and a tumpus (from (10) and (17)), this is consistent with Rex being a wumpus.\n- From (16), each lempus is a dumpus. Since Rex is a dumpus (from (10) and (17)), this suggests that Rex could potentially be a lempus.\n- However, from (21), we need to prove that Rex is not a lempus.\n\nLet's examine further:\n\n- If Rex were a lempus, then according to (11), he would also be a wumpus. As a wumpus, from (5), he would be a tumpus, which he already is. This part aligns with the premises.\n- But, considering (13), shumpuses are not impuses. Since Rex is a sterpus (from (12)) and hence an impus (from (4)), and also a yumpus (from (20)), he fits the criteria for being a shumpus according to (6). Therefore, Rex is a shumpus.\n- From (14), each shumpus is a brimpus, which means Rex is also a brimpus.\n\nGiven that Rex is both a brimpus (from being a shumpus) and a lorpus (from premise (1)), this doesn't directly conflict with him being a lempus based on the given information alone because there isn't a direct statement saying brimpuses or lorpuses cannot be lempuses.\n\nHowever, since the task is to prove that Rex is not a lempus, we need to find a contradiction or an implication in the premises that prevents Rex from being classified as a lempus under the given conditions.\n\nUpon reviewing the premises again, especially focusing on those involving lempuses and their relationships with other categories, there seems to be no direct contradiction preventing Rex from being considered a lempus based solely on the information provided. The premises establish various relationships among different creatures but do not conclusively rule out the possibility of Rex being a lempus while fulfilling his other characteristics.\n\nTherefore, without additional information or a specific contradiction within the given premises that directly addresses why Rex cannot be a lempus, we cannot definitively prove that \"Rex is not a lempus\" based solely on the information provided.

Let's analyze the information step by step:\n\n1. **Premise (21)** states that if Rex is not a lempus, then Taylor is a visionary. This is a conditional statement that sets a clear path for proving the conclusion.\n\n2. Next, let's examine **premises related to Rex's characteristics** to determine whether he can be classified as a lempus or not:\n   - **Premise (2)** tells us Rex is a lorpus.\n   - **Premise (3)** tells us every wumpus is a lempus.\n   - **Premise (5)** tells us wumpuses are tumpuses.\n   - **Premise (6)** tells us lempuses are wumpuses.\n   - **Premise (8)** tells us each lempus is a rompus.\n   - **Premise (10)** tells us everything that is a lorpus and a vumpus and a dumpus is a tumpus.\n   - **Premises (11), (12), (17)** tell us that lempuses are wumpuses and each lempus is a dumpus.\n   - **Premises (16), (18), (19)** tell us Rex is a dumpus and a vumpus.\n   - **Premises (13), (14), (15)** tell us Rex is a sterpus and each shumpus is a brimpus and shumpuses are not impuses.\n   - **Premise (20)** tells us Rex is a numpus.\n   - **Premise (21)** tells us Rex is a yumpus.\n\n3. From **premise (12)**, we know that lempuses are wumpuses. Since Rex is a lorpus (from premise (2)), and every wumpus is a lempus (from premise (3)), it seems Rex could be considered a lempus. However, we must also consider other characteristics of Rex that might contradict this possibility.\n\n4. Rex being a sterpus (from premise (13)) means he is an impus (from premise (5)). Being an impus doesn't directly conflict with being a lempus, but we need to look at other aspects.\n\n5. Rex being a yumpus (from premise (21)) and a numpus (from premise (20)), along with being a vumpus and a dumpus (from premises (16), (18), (19)), suggests that he fits the criteria for being a shumpus according to premise (7), which states everything that is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus is a shumpus.\n\n6. Since Rex is a shumpus, and according to premise (14), shumpuses are not impuses, this creates a contradiction because Rex being a sterpus means he is an impus (from premise (5)). Therefore, Rex cannot be both a shumpus and an impus simultaneously.\n\n7. This contradiction implies that there must be a mistake in our assumption that Rex could be considered a lempus based solely on him being a lorpus and the relationship between wumpuses and lempuses. The fact that Rex is also identified as having characteristics that make him a shumpus, which cannot be an impus, contradicts the chain of relationships that would otherwise classify him as a lempus.\n\n8. Thus, since Rex cannot be a lempus due to the contradiction found in his characteristics as a shumpus, we conclude that **Rex is not a lempus**.\n\n9. Given that **Rex is not a lempus**, according to premise (1), **Taylor is a visionary**.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion **(22) Taylor is a visionary** is proven based on the logical deduction from the given premises."}]
