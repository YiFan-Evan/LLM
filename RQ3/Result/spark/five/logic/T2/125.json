Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

This implies that if something is a tumpus, it must also be a sterpus.\n   - Premise (3), (4), (6), (11): Rex is a shumpus, a wumpus, a lorpus, and again a shumpus. These establish multiple identities for Rex.\n   - Premise (5): Impuses are wumpuses. Since Rex is an impus, this means Rex is also a wumpus.\n   - Premise (7): Everything that is a shumpus, a yumpus, and a grimpus is a gorpus.\n   - Premise (8): Lorpuses are brimpuses. This means Rex, as a lorpus, is also a brimpus.\n   - Premise (9): Everything that is a lorpus, a shumpus, and a wumpus is a dumpus. Given Rex fulfills these conditions, he is thus a dumpus.\n   - Premise (10): Rex is a tumpus, Rex is not a brimpus, and Rex is an impus. This contradicts with Premise (8), where we established Rex as a brimpus. Therefore, there's a logical inconsistency here.\n   - Premise (12): Rex is a wumpus, a gorpus, and a jompus. This aligns with our previous findings about Rex being a wumpus.\n   - Premise (13): Rex is a yumpus. This further confirms Rex's identity as a yumpus.\n\n2. **Logical Deduction**:\n   - From Premise (7) and knowing Rex is a shumpus, a yumpus, and a gorpus from other premises, we can infer that Rex must be a gorpus.\n   - From Premise (9) and knowing Rex is a lorpus, a shumpus, and a wumpus, we can deduce that Rex is a dumpus.\n   - The contradiction in Premises (8) and (10) regarding whether Rex is or isn't a brimpus suggests an error or misinterpretation in the premises. However, for the sake of proving (14), we proceed by acknowledging Rex could be a brimpus due to other supporting evidence.\n   - If Rex were a grimpus, according to Premise (1), since Rex is already identified as being a shumpus, a yumpus, and a grimpus, Rex would then have to be a brimpus. However, this leads to a contradiction with Premise (10), which states Rex is not a brimpus.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the contradiction between the necessity of Rex being a brimpus if he were a grimpus (according to Premise (1)) and the direct statement that Rex is not a brimpus in Premise (10), we can conclude that Rex cannot be a grimpus without causing a logical inconsistency.\n   - Therefore, based on the logical deduction and analysis of the provided premises, Rex must not be a grimpus to maintain consistency among the statements.\n\nHence, the proof that **Rex is not a grimpus** stands valid under the logical framework established by the given premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a yumpus.

Thus, Rex must be a gorpus.\n   - Rex being a lorpus from Premise (8) and a shumpus from Premise (11), along with being a wumpus from Premise (10), meets the conditions of Premise (5), so Rex is a dumpus.\n   - Premise (6) states that lorpuses are brimpuses, which means Rex, being a lorpus, should also be a brimpus. However, this contradicts Premise (4) which states Rex is not a brimpus. This inconsistency indicates an error or misinterpretation in the premises regarding Rex's status as a brimpus. For the sake of proving (14), we will assume the correctness of Premise (4) over Premise (6).\n   - If Rex were a grimpus, according to Premise (7), since Rex is already identified as being a shumpus, a yumpus, and a grimpus, Rex would then have to be a brimpus. However, this leads to a contradiction with Premise (4), which states Rex is not a brimpus.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Given the contradiction between the necessity of Rex being a brimpus if he were a grimpus (according to Premise (7)) and the direct statement that Rex is not a brimpus in Premise (4), we can conclude that Rex cannot be a grimpus without causing a logical inconsistency.\n   - Therefore, based on the logical deduction and analysis of the provided premises, Rex must not be a grimpus to maintain consistency among the statements.\n\nHence, the proof that **Rex is not a grimpus** stands valid under the logical framework established by the given premises."}]
