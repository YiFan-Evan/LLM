You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

However, this classification does not directly contribute to proving she is a vumpus.\n5. **Stella is bright** (Premise 16), which means she can be classified as a vumpus because **everything that is bright and a tumpus is a vumpus** (Premise 9). Since Stella is already established as a tumpus, she satisfies both conditions of being bright and a tumpus, thus making her a vumpus.\n6. Combining Premises 1 and 5, Stella being temperate (from Premise 17) and being a vumpus (from the combination of being bright and a tumpus as per Premise 9), leads us to the conclusion that Stella is temperate and a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises required to prove that Stella is temperate and a vumpus includes:\n- (17), Stella is temperate,\n- (16), Stella is bright,\n- (18), Stella is a tumpus,\n- (9), Everything that is bright and a tumpus is a vumpus.\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n(17), (16), (18), (9) -> (20)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Stella is angry.
