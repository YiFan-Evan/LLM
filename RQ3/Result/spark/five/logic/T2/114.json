[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Here are five examples: 1. [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Premises: [(1) Each zumpus is a jompus and a yumpus.

Since we are assuming Sam is a tumpus, we need to check if Sam is also a yumpus and a rompus.\n   - Premise (12) states that Sam is a yumpus.\n   - Premise (14) states that Sam is a rompus.\n   - Therefore, since Sam is a tumpus, a yumpus, and a rompus, according to premise (8), Sam is a wumpus.\n\n3. **Further analysis based on Sam being a wumpus:**\n   - Premise (4) states that everything that is a wumpus, a tumpus, and a lempus is a vumpus.
