Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Starting with premise (10), we know that \"Rex is a jompus.\"\n2. From premise (5), since Rex is a jompus, he must be a grimpus.\n3. According to premise (7), everything that is a grimpus, a sterpus, or a lempus is a numpus. Since Rex is a grimpus, he must also be a numpus.\n4. Premise (8) states that \"Zumpuses are numpuses.\" This means that being a zumpus implies being a numpus. However, it doesn't state that all numpuses are zumpuses. Therefore, we can't directly conclude from here whether Rex is a zumpus or not.\n5. Premise (6) tells us that \"Jompuses are impuses.\" Since Rex is a jompus (from step 1), he must also be an impus.\n6. Premise (2) says that everything that is a wumpus, a shumpus, or a sterpus is an impus. We already know from step 5 that Rex is an impus. However, this does not necessarily mean that Rex is specifically a wumpus, shumpus, or sterpus; it only confirms that if he were any of these, he would still be an impus.\n7. Premise (3) states that \"Rompuses are impuses.\" This information doesn't directly relate to Rex but could be relevant for other parts of the proof.\n8. Now, let's consider premise (4), which states that everything that is a lorpus, a gorpus, or a grimpus is an impus. Since Rex is a grimpus (from step 2), he is covered by this premise as well. However, this doesn't add new information about Rex's specific status beyond being an impus.\n9. Premise (1) states that everything that is a lorpus, a gorpus, or a grimpus is a wumpus, rompus, and zumpus. Since Rex is a grimpus, he must also be a wumpus.\n10. Combining the information from steps 5, 6, and 9, Rex is both an impus and a wumpus.\n\nFrom the analysis above, we have determined that Rex is definitely an impus and a wumpus due to his status as a jompus and a grimpus.
