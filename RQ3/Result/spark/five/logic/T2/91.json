(3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

However, none of these colors directly link to being luminous, metallic, or a yumpus.\n\n3. **Next Intermediate Step**: Since Fae is also a shumpus (Premise 13), and from Premise 8, \"Everything that is sour or bitter or a shumpus is an impus,\" we can infer that Fae is an impus.\n\n4. **Final Step**: Now, considering Fae as an impus, we need to connect this to being luminous, metallic, or a yumpus. None of the direct premises connect impus to any of these attributes. Therefore, we cannot directly derive that Fae is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus solely based on the given premises.\n\nHowever, looking at Premise 6, \"Everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus,\" we see that being a yumpus is sufficient for being a vumpus. If Fae were a yumpus, then by Premise 6, she would be a vumpus, which aligns with the goal of proving she is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus.\n\nGiven the information, the closest we can get without directly violating any premises is recognizing that Fae being a grimpus and a shumpus does not directly lead us to conclude she is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus based on the logical structure provided. Thus, based on the given premises, we cannot prove that \"Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus\" directly.
