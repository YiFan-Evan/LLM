Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Let's analyze each step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: We begin with the information about Stella, specifically that she is a zumpus (from premise 11) and a dumpus (from premise 12).\n\n2. **Connecting Zumpus to Gorpus**: According to premise 8, zumpuses are brimpuses. Since Stella is a zumpus, Stella is also a brimpus. However, this information alone does not directly relate to Stella being melodic.\n\n3. **Connecting Dumpus to Gorpus**: Premise 2 states that every dumpus is a gorpus. Since Stella is a dumpus, it follows that Stella is a gorpus.\n\n4. **Gorpus to Impus**: From premise 1, we know that every gorpus is an impus. Applying this to our current knowledge that Stella is a gorpus, we can infer that Stella is also an impus.\n\n5. **Gorpus Characteristics**: Premise 7 tells us that gorpuses are melodic. This is a crucial premise because it directly links gorpuses to the property of being melodic.\n\n6. **Conclusion**: Since we have established through logical deduction that Stella is a gorpus, and all gorpuses are melodic according to premise 7, it follows that Stella is melodic.\n\nTherefore, by connecting the premises about Stella's status as a dumpus and a zumpus, and using the characteristics associated with these categories (specifically, that dumpuses are gorpuses, and gorpuses are melodic), we can conclude that Stella is indeed melodic.
