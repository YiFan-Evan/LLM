You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Let's go through the premises step by step to see how they connect:\n\n(1) Every vumpus is transparent. (This doesn't seem directly relevant to proving Sam is overcast, but it establishes a property of vumpuses.)\n\n(2) Brimpuses are slow. (This also seems unrelated, but it establishes a property of brimpuses.)\n\n(3) Every gorpus is not melodic. (This premise talks about gorpuses and their properties but does not seem immediately relevant to Sam being overcast.)\n\n(4) Dumpuses are nervous. (Like the others, this establishes a property of dumpuses but doesn't seem directly related to Sam being overcast.)\n\n(5) Each zumpus is a wumpus. (This tells us something about zumpuses but doesn't directly relate to Sam being overcast.)\n\n(6) Zumpuses are dumpuses. (Again, this provides information about zumpuses and dumpuses but doesn't seem directly relevant to Sam being overcast.)\n\n(7) Every yumpus is cold. (This establishes a property of yumpuses but doesn't directly relate to Sam being overcast.)\n\n(8) Every yumpus is a brimpus. (This links yumpuses with brimpuses, potentially connecting to Sam since Sam is mentioned as a yumpus in premise (16).)\n\n(9) Lorpuses are earthy. (This establishes a property of lorpuses but doesn't seem directly relevant to Sam being overcast.)\n\n(10) Every yumpus is a lorpus. (This connects yumpuses with lorpuses, which might be relevant because Sam is mentioned as a yumpus in premise (16).)\n\n(11) Vumpuses are impuses. (This establishes a relationship between vumpuses and impuses but isn't directly related to Sam being overcast.)\n\n(12) Zumpuses are overcast. (This is key because it directly states that zumpuses are overcast. Since Sam is mentioned as a yumpus in premise (16), this could be the link we need.)\n\n(13) Lorpuses are zumpuses. (This tells us that lorpuses are a type of zumpus, which might be relevant because of premise (12).)\n\n(14) Lorpuses are gorpuses. (This tells us that lorpuses are a type of gorpus, but it's not directly relevant to proving that Sam is overcast.)\n\n(15) Sam is a vumpus. (This establishes that Sam is a vumpus, which has its own properties according to premise (1).)\n\n(16) Sam is a yumpus. (This is crucial because it directly links Sam to the property established in premise (12), that yumpuses are overcast.)\n\nNow, let's piece together the reasoning:\n\n- From premise (12), we know that zumpuses are overcast.\n- From premise (16), we know that Sam is a yumpus.\n- Therefore, combining these two facts, we can conclude that since Sam is a yumpus and all yumpuses are overcast, then Sam must also be overcast.\n\nThus, the proof for (17) Sam is overcast would be:\n(16), (12) -> (17)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sam is a yumpus.
