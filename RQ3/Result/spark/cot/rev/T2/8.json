Here's the thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 3], [1, 5], [1, 7], [2, 4], [5, 6]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The starting point is node 1.\n3. **Destination**: The destination is node 4.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (1).\n2. Mark node 1 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination (node 4), stop the search.\n4. Reconstruct the path from the destination to the start using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 1.\n2. Enqueue 1: `[1]`\n3. Dequeue 1:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 3, 5, and 7: `[3, 5, 7]`\n4. Dequeue 3:\n   - Enqueue neighbor 1 (already visited): `[5, 7]`\n5. Dequeue 5:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 6 and 1 (already visited): `[6, 7]`\n6. Dequeue 6:\n   - Enqueue neighbor 5 (already visited): `[7]`\n7.
