Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and edges are [[0, 2], [0, 7], [0, 12], [1, 9], [2, 3], [3, 6], [4, 12], [5, 11], [6, 9], [7, 8], [7, 11], [9, 10]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 5.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 7.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (5).\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3.
