Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 3], [0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 5.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 4.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (5).\n2. Mark node 5 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination (4), stop the search.\n4.
