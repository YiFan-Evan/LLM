Nodes are [0, 13, 3, 14, 12, 8, 9, 6, 10, 11, 14] and edges are [[0, 13], [0, 3], [1, 9], [1, 6], [2, 8], [3, 14], [4, 12], [4, 8], [5, 6], [5, 13], [7, 9], [8, 10], [10, 11], [10, 14]].\n2. **Starting Point**: Node 10.\n3. **Destination**: Node 6.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1.
