Here's a step-by-step thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 2], [0, 7], [1, 6], [1, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 7]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 2.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 5.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (2).\n2. Mark node 2 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination (5), stop the search.\n4. Reconstruct the path from the destination to the start using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 2.\n2. Enqueue 2.\n3. Dequeue 2, enqueue its neighbors 0 and 7.\n4. Dequeue 0, enqueue its neighbors 2 and 7 (already visited).\n5. Dequeue 7, enqueue its neighbors 0 and 3 (already visited).\n6. Dequeue 3, enqueue its neighbors 1, 4, 5, and 7 (already visited).\n7. Dequeue 1, enqueue its neighbors 6 and 3 (already visited).\n8. Dequeue 6, enqueue its neighbors 1 and 3 (already visited).\n9. Dequeue 4, enqueue its neighbors 3 (already visited).\n10. Dequeue 5, which is the destination.\n\n### Path Reconstruction:\n- From node 5, follow the parent pointers back to the start node:\n  - 5 -> 3 -> 1 -> 6 -> 1 -> 3 -> 0 -> 2\n- However, this path includes some redundant steps due to revisiting nodes.
