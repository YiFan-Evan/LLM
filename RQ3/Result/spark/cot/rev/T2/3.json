Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 3], [0, 5], [1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 4.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 5.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (4).\n2. Mark the start node as visited.\n3.
