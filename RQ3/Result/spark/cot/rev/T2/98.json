Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and edges are [[0, 7], [0, 10], [0, 8], [1, 4], [2, 8], [2, 6], [2, 9], [3, 10], [4, 10], [5, 11], [5, 6], [9, 12]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 8.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 9.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (8).\n2. Mark node 8 as visited.\n3.
