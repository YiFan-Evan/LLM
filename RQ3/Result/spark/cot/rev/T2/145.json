Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and edges are [[0, 3], [1, 6], [2, 14], [3, 14], [4, 14], [5, 11], [5, 7], [6, 10], [6, 9], [7, 12], [7, 14], [8, 13], [8, 9], [9, 11]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 8.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 4.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (8).\n2. Mark node 8 as visited.\n3.
