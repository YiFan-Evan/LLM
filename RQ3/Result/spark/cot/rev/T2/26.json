Here's a step-by-step thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 6], [0, 2], [1, 5], [2, 7], [3, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 6.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 0.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (6).\n2. Mark node 6 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n4. Once the destination node (0) is dequeued, reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 6: `queue = [6]`, `visited = {6}`.\n2. Dequeue 6: `current_node = 6`.\n   - Neighbors of 6: [0].\n   - Visit 0: `queue = [0]`, `visited = {0, 6}`, `parent = {0: 6}`.\n3. Dequeue 0: `current_node = 0`.\n   - Neighbors of 0: [6].\n   - Since 6 is already visited, no action needed.\n4.
