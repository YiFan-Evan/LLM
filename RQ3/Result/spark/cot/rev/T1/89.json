Here's the thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and edges are [[0, 1], [0, 2], [2, 4], [3, 7], [3, 8], [3, 4], [4, 6], [4, 12], [5, 10], [5, 12], [6, 11], [8, 9]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 6.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 8.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (6).\n2. Mark node 6 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination (8), stop the search.\n4. Reconstruct the path from the destination to the start using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 6.\n2. Enqueue 6 and mark it as visited.\n3.
