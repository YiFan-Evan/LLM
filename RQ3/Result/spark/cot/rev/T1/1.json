Here's a step-by-step thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 1], [0, 7], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 2.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 6.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (2).\n2. Mark node 2 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination (6), stop the search.\n4. Reconstruct the path from the destination node back to the start node using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 2.\n2. Enqueue 2.\n3.
