Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 3], [0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]].\n2. **Starting Point**: We start at node 5.\n3. **Destination**: We want to reach node 4.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (5).\n2. Mark node 5 as visited.\n3.
