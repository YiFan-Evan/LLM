Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and edges are [[0, 4], [0, 3], [0, 7], [1, 11], [2, 5], [2, 11], [3, 11], [6, 12], [6, 7], [7, 14], [8, 13], [8, 12], [9, 13], [10, 12]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 6.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 5.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (6).\n2. Mark node 6 as visited.\n3.
