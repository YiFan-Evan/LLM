Here's a step-by-step thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 6], [2, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6], [4, 7]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 2.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 5.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (2).\n2. Mark node 2 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination (5), stop the search.\n4. Reconstruct the path from the destination node back to the start node using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 2.\n2. Enqueue 2.\n3. Dequeue 2, enqueue its neighbors 6 and 4.\n4. Dequeue 6, enqueue its neighbors (none since they are all visited or out of bounds).\n5. Dequeue 4, enqueue its neighbor 7.\n6. Dequeue 7, enqueue its neighbor (none since it is out of bounds).\n7. Dequeue 5 (reached via node 3), enqueue its neighbors (none since they are all visited or out of bounds).\n8.
