If we reach the destination node (0), we reconstruct the path using the parent information stored in the `visited` dictionary.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once the destination is reached, we backtrack from the destination to the start node using the parent information to construct the path.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 0 in the given graph is:\n```plaintext\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->7->6->0\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]} The end node: 0 The start node: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
