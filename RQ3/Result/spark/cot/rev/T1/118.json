Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and edges are [[0, 12], [1, 10], [2, 3], [3, 11], [3, 7], [4, 10], [4, 7], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 9], [6, 8], [8, 12]].\n2. **Starting Point**: Node 9.\n3. **Destination**: Node 7.\n4. **Algorithm Choice**: BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize a queue** with the starting node (9).\n2. **Track visited nodes** to avoid cycles and redundant processing.\n3. **Track the path** using a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is the previous node on the path.\n4. **Perform BFS**:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node, if it hasn't been visited:\n     - Mark it as visited.\n     - Record the path.\n     - Enqueue the neighbor.\n5. **Reconstruct the path** once the destination node (7) is reached.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 9.\n2. Enqueue 9 and mark it as visited.\n3. Dequeue 9:\n   - Neighbors of 9 are 6 and 8.\n   - Enqueue 6 and 8, marking them as visited.\n4.
