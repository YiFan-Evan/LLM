Here's the thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and edges are [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 8], [3, 7], [4, 8], [4, 6], [5, 10], [6, 7], [7, 9], [9, 11], [9, 12], [10, 11]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 6.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 4.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (6).\n2. Mark node 6 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination (4), stop the search.\n4. Reconstruct the path from the destination node back to the start node using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 6.\n2. Enqueue 6 and mark it as visited.\n3. Dequeue 6:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 7 and 4 (since they are connected to 6).\n4. Dequeue 7:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 6, 9 (already visited), and 3 (already visited).\n5. Dequeue 4:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 8 and 6 (already visited).\n6. Dequeue 8:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 2 and 4 (already visited).\n7. Dequeue 2:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 8 (already visited).\n8.
