Here's a step-by-step thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 4], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 3], [3, 7], [4, 5], [6, 7]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 6.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 5.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (6).\n2. Mark node 6 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination (5), stop the search.\n4. Reconstruct the path from the destination node back to the start node using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 6.\n2. Enqueue 6 and mark it as visited.\n3. Dequeue 6:\n   - Neighbors of 6 are 7 and 1 (since edges are bidirectional).\n   - Enqueue 7 and mark it as visited with parent 6.\n   - Enqueue 1 and mark it as visited with parent 6.\n4. Dequeue 7:\n   - Neighbor of 7 is 6 (already visited).\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n5. Dequeue 1:\n   - Neighbor of 1 is 6 (already visited).\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n6. Dequeue 7 again:\n   - Neighbor of 7 is 6 (already visited).\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n7. Dequeue 1 again:\n   - Neighbor of 1 is 6 (already visited).\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n8. Continue until the queue is empty or the destination is found.\n9.
