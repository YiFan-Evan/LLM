Here's the thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are the points, and edges are the connections between these points.\n2. **Starting Point**: We start at node 10.\n3. **Destination**: We need to reach node 9.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**: BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. It explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n5. **Steps**:\n   - Initialize a queue with the starting node.\n   - Use a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parent nodes to reconstruct the path.\n   - Dequeue a node, check if it is the destination. If yes, reconstruct the path using the parent nodes.\n   - If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.\n\n### Implementation:\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the starting node\n    queue = deque([start])\n    # Dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parents\n    visited = {start: None}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if current == goal:\n            return reconstruct_path(visited, start, goal)\n        \n        # Get all neighbors of the current node\n        neighbors = [edge[1] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[0] == current] + \\\n                    [edge[0] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[1] == current]\n        \n        for neighbor in neighbors:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n                visited[neighbor] = current\n    \n    return \"No path found\"\n\ndef reconstruct_path(visited, start, goal):\n    path = []\n    step = goal\n    while step is not None:\n        path.append(step)\n        step = visited[step]\n    path.reverse()\n    return '->'.join(map(str, path))\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 17], [2, 18], [3, 8], [4, 11], [4, 20], [4, 19], [5, 12], [5, 24], [6, 17], [7, 23], [7, 9], [8, 23], [9, 10], [9, 12], [12, 22], [13, 15], [13, 21], [14, 19], [16, 18], [16, 19], [16, 21], [17, 21], [17, 22]]\n}\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 10\ndestination_node = 9\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: `10->9`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 17], [2, 18], [3, 8], [4, 11], [4, 20], [4, 19], [5, 12], [5, 24], [6, 17], [7, 23], [7, 9], [8, 23], [9, 10], [9, 12], [12, 22], [13, 15], [13, 21], [14, 19], [16, 18], [16, 19], [16, 21], [17, 21], [17, 22]]} The start node: 10 The destination: '.join(map(str, path))\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 17], [2, 18], [3, 8], [4, 11], [4, 20], [4, 19], [5, 12], [5, 24], [6, 17], [7, 23], [7, 9], [8, 23], [9, 10], [9, 12], [12, 22], [13, 15], [13, 21], [14, 19], [16, 18], [16, 19], [16, 21], [17, 21], [17, 22]]\n}\n\n# Start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 10\ndestination_node = 9\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: `10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path in a graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS), we need to implement the BFS algorithm.
