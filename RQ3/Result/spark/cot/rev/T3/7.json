Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 2], [0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 4.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 6.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: `[(4, [])]` where each element is a tuple containing the current node and the path taken to reach it.\n   - Visited: `{4}`\n   - Parent: `{}`\n\n2. **Iterate**:\n   - Dequeue an element from the queue.\n   - If the current node is the destination (6), reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighbors with updated paths.\n\n### Execution:\n1. Start with node 4:\n   - Enqueue neighbors: 1 (path: [4])\n   - Mark 4 as visited.\n\n2. Dequeue node 4:\n   - Path: [4]\n   - Enqueue neighbors: 1 (path: [4, 1])\n   - Mark 1 as visited.\n\n3.
