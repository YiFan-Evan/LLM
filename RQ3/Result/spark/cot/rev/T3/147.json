Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and edges are [[0, 5], [0, 11], [0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 8], [1, 9], [2, 9], [3, 6], [4, 10], [6, 12], [6, 14], [7, 9], [7, 12], [10, 13]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 3.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 13.\n4. **Algorithm Choice**: BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize a queue**: Start with the starting node 3.\n2. **Track visited nodes**: To avoid cycles and redundant paths.\n3. **Track the path**: Maintain a dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1.
