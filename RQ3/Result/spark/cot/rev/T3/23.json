Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 3.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 6.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (3).\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3.
