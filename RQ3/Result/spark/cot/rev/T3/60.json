If a neighbor has not been visited, we mark it as visited and enqueue it. This continues until we reach the destination node (4).\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: Once we reach the destination node, we backtrack using the parent records stored in the `visited` dictionary to construct the path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `5->4`"}]
