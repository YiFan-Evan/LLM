Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and edges are [[0, 3], [0, 12], [0, 4], [1, 9], [2, 8], [2, 4], [2, 14], [5, 10], [5, 13], [6, 7], [7, 9], [7, 14], [9, 11], [12, 13]].\n2. **Starting Point**: Node 3.\n3. **Destination**: Node 13.\n4. **Algorithm Choice**: BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\n\n### Steps:\n1. **Initialize a queue** with the starting node (3).\n2. **Track visited nodes** to avoid cycles and redundant processing.\n3. **Track the path** using a dictionary where each key is a node and its value is the previous node on the path.\n4. **Perform BFS**:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node, if it hasn't been visited:\n     - Mark it as visited.\n     - Enqueue it.\n     - Record the path.\n   - If the destination node (13) is reached, stop and reconstruct the path.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1.
