Here's the thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and edges are [[0, 9], [1, 6], [1, 8], [1, 9], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 8], [4, 7], [5, 12], [9, 11], [10, 11]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 7.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 2.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a parent dictionary to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (7).\n2. Mark node 7 as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination (2), stop the search.\n4. Reconstruct the path from the destination node back to the start node using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 7.\n2. Enqueue 7 and mark it as visited.\n3. Dequeue 7:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 4 and 9 (since they are connected to 7).\n4. Dequeue 4:\n   - Enqueue neighbor 2 (since it is connected to 4).\n5. Dequeue 2:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 4 and 6 (since they are connected to 2).\n6. Dequeue 9:\n   - Enqueue neighbor 11 (since it is connected to 9).\n7. Dequeue 2 again:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 4 and 6 (already visited).\n8.
