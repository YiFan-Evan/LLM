Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 5], [0, 6], [1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 3], [4, 6], [6, 7]].\n\n2. **Initialization**:\n   - Start with node 5.\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parent nodes to reconstruct the path later.\n\n3. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Enqueue the start node (5) into the queue.\n   - Mark node 5 as visited.\n   - While the queue is not empty:\n     - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n     - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n       - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n         - Mark it as visited.\n         - Record its parent (the node from which it was reached).\n         - Enqueue the neighbor.\n       - If the neighbor is the destination node (0), stop the search.\n\n4. **Path Reconstruction**:\n   - Once the destination node is found, backtrack using the parent records to construct the path from the destination to the start node.\n\nLet's implement this step-by-step:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node\n    queue = deque([start])\n    # Dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parents\n    visited = {start: None}\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue a node from the front of the queue\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if current == goal:\n            break\n        \n        # Get neighbors of the current node\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    # Mark the neighbor as visited and record its parent\n                    visited[next_node] = current\n                    queue.append(next_node)\n    \n    # Backtrack to find the path from start to goal\n    path = []\n    step = goal\n    while step is not None:\n        path.append(step)\n        step = visited[step]\n    path.reverse()\n    \n    return path\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 3], [4, 6], [6, 7]]}\nstart_node = 5\ndestination_node = 0\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize the BFS with node 5 and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: We explore all neighbors of node 5 (which are nodes 0 and 6).

For each node, we check its neighbors and add unvisited neighbors to the queue. If we reach the goal node (0), we break out of the loop.\n3. **Path Reconstruction**: After finding the goal node, we backtrack from the goal node to the start node using the `visited` dictionary to reconstruct the path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\n5->0\n```"}]
