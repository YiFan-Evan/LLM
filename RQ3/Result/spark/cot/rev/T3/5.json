Here's the thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], and edges are [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [3, 7], [4, 6], [6, 7]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The starting point is node 0.\n3. **Destination**: The destination is node 6.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (0).\n2. Mark the start node as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n4. Once the destination node (6) is dequeued, reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 0.\n2. Enqueue 0 and mark it as visited.\n3. Dequeue 0:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 1 and 3 (mark them as visited).\n4. Dequeue 1:\n   - Enqueue neighbor 0 (already visited).\n5. Dequeue 3:\n   - Enqueue neighbors 5, 7, and 0 (already visited).\n6. Dequeue 5:\n   - Enqueue neighbor 3 (already visited).\n7. Dequeue 7:\n   - Enqueue neighbor 6 (mark it as visited).\n8. Dequeue 6:\n   - Enqueue neighbor 7 (already visited).\n9.
