Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and edges are [[0, 6], [0, 11], [1, 7], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 7], [6, 9], [8, 10], [10, 11], [10, 12]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 1.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 5.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (1).\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     - If the neighbor has not been visited:\n       - Mark it as visited.\n       - Record its parent.\n       - Enqueue the neighbor.\n4. Once the destination node (5) is dequeued, reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary.\n\n### BFS Implementation:\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the start node\n    queue = deque([start])\n    # Dictionary to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited = {start}\n    # Dictionary to store the parent of each node\n    parent = {start: None}\n    \n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # Check if we have reached the goal\n        if current == goal:\n            break\n        \n        # Get neighbors of the current node\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    visited.add(next_node)\n                    parent[next_node] = current\n                    queue.append(next_node)\n    \n    # Reconstruct the path from goal to start using the parent dictionary\n    path = []\n    step = goal\n    while step is not None:\n        path.append(step)\n        step = parent[step]\n    path.reverse()\n    \n    return '->'.join(map(str, path))\n\n# Given graph\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 11], [1, 7], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 7], [6, 9], [8, 10], [10, 11], [10, 12]]}\nstart_node = 1\ndestination_node = 5\n\n# Find the shortest path\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: `1->7->3->2->5`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 11], [1, 7], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 7], [6, 9], [8, 10], [10, 11], [10, 12]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 2 in the given graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
