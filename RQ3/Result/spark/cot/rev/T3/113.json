Here's the thought process and the final answer:\n\n### Thought Process:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented by nodes and edges. Nodes are [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], and edges are [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 7], [2, 11], [3, 5], [3, 8], [4, 12], [5, 9], [6, 11], [6, 12], [8, 10]].\n2. **Starting Point**: The start node is 0.\n3. **Destination**: The target node is 7.\n4. **BFS Algorithm**:\n   - Use a queue to explore nodes level by level.\n   - Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\n   - Maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (0).\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node.\n   - If it is the destination node (7), reconstruct the path using the parent dictionary and return it.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.\n4. If the queue is exhausted without finding the destination, return that no path exists.\n\n### BFS Execution:\n1. Start with node 0.\n2. Enqueue 0's neighbors: 3 and 4.\n3. Visit node 3:\n   - Enqueue its neighbors: 5 and 8 (since 0 is already visited).\n4. Visit node 4:\n   - Enqueue its neighbor: 12 (since 0 is already visited).\n5. Visit node 5:\n   - Enqueue its neighbor: 9 (since 3 is already visited).\n6. Visit node 8:\n   - Enqueue its neighbor: 10 (since 3 is already visited).\n7. Visit node 9:\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n8. Visit node 10:\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n9. Visit node 12:\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue.\n10. Visit node 3 again (from step 3):\n    - Enqueue its neighbors: 5 and 8 (already visited).\n11.
