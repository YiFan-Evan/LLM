This variable serves as a counter for iterating through the array in reverse order.\n\n2. **While Loop**:\n   - The loop runs as long as `s` is greater than 0.\n   - In each iteration, `s` is decremented by 1 (`s -= 1`), moving the index one step backward.\n   - The element at the current index `s` (which is now `arr[s]`) is added to `sum_value`.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - Once the loop completes (i.e., when `s` equals 0), the function returns `sum_value`, which now contains the total sum of all elements in the array.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    s = len(arr)\n    while s > 0:\n        s -= 1\n        sum_value += arr[s]\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```python\nexample_array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nresult = give_sum(example_array)\nprint(result)  # Output will be 15\n```\n\nIn this example, the function calculates the sum of the elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is `15`.\n\n### Explanation of the Loop Invariant:\n\nFor the i-th iteration of the loop (where `i` starts from 1 and goes up to the length of the array):\n- `s = len(arr) - i`\n- `sum_value = sum of first (i-1) elements of arr`\n\nThis ensures that each element of the array is added exactly once to `sum_value`."}]
