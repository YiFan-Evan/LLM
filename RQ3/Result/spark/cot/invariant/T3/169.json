The loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration can be described as follows:\n\n**Loop Invariant for the `i-th` Iteration:**\n\"At the start of the `i-th` iteration, the subarray `arr[0...i-1]` is sorted.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - The outer loop starts with `i = 1` because a single element (the first element) is trivially sorted.\n   - `key = arr[i]` stores the value of the current element that needs to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array.\n\n2. **Inner Loop:**\n   - The inner loop compares the `key` with elements in the sorted portion of the array (from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`).\n   - If `arr[j] > key`, it shifts `arr[j]` to the right by one position (`arr[j + 1] = arr[j]`).\n   - This process continues until we find the correct position for `key` or reach the beginning of the array.\n\n3. **Insertion:**\n   - Once the correct position is found (when `arr[j] <= key`), `key` is inserted at `arr[j + 1]`.\n\n4. **Repeat:**\n   - The outer loop then increments `i` and repeats the process for the next element.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\nConsider the array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`.\n\n- **First Iteration (i = 1):**\n  - `key = 2`\n  - Compare `2` with `5` (no swap needed)\n  - Insert `2` before `5` resulting in `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`\n\n- **Second Iteration (i = 2):**\n  - `key = 9`\n  - No changes needed since `9` is already greater than `5`\n  - Array remains `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`\n\n- **Third Iteration (i = 3):**\n  - `key = 1`\n  - Compare `1` with `9`, then with `5`, then with `2`\n  - Shift `9`, `5`, and `2` to the right\n  - Insert `1` at the beginning resulting in `[1, 2, 5, 9, 5, 6]`\n\n- **Fourth Iteration (i = 4):**\n  - `key = 5`\n  - Compare `5` with `9`\n  - Shift `9` to the right\n  - Insert `5` before `9` resulting in `[1, 2, 5, 5, 9, 6]`\n\n- **Fifth Iteration (i = 5):**\n  - `key = 6`\n  - Compare `6` with `9`\n  - Shift `9` to the right\n  - Insert `6` before `9` resulting in `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n\n### Therefore, the final answer is:\nThe array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]` is sorted to `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]` using the insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = len(arr)\n    while j > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        j -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code for the insertion sort algorithm contains a few errors.

The outer loop iterates over each element starting from the second element (index 1), treating it as the key to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array. The inner loop shifts elements that are greater than the key to the right, making space for the key to be inserted in its correct position."}]
