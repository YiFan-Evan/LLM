[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

However, there are a few issues with the current implementation that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The initial value of `mid_value` is set to `arr[0]`, which is not necessarily the middle element.\n2. The loop condition `while 2 * t < len(arr)` will cause the loop to run until `t` is less than half the length of the array. This means it will stop before reaching the actual middle element in most cases.\n3. The variable `t` is used to traverse the array, but its purpose is unclear because it doesn't directly contribute to finding the middle element.\n\nTo correctly find the middle element of an array, you can use the following approach:\n\n- If the array has an odd number of elements, the middle element is at index `len(arr) // 2`.\n- If the array has an even number of elements, there are two middle elements, and you might want to return either one or both depending on your requirements.
