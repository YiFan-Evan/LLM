Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `count_value` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of times the target value appears in the array.\n   - `q` is initialized to 0. This variable serves as the index for iterating through the array.\n\n2. **Loop Through Array**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `q` is less than the length of the array (`len(arr)`).\n   - Inside the loop, there is a conditional statement that checks if the current element of the array (`arr[q]`) is equal to the target value.\n   - If the condition is true, `count_value` is incremented by 1.\n   - After each iteration, `q` is incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the array.\n\n3. **Return Result**:\n   - Once the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count_value`, which represents the total count of the target value in the array.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    q = 0\n    while q < len(arr):\n        if arr[q] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        q += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nLet's say you have an array `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5]` and you want to count how many times the number `2` appears in this array.
