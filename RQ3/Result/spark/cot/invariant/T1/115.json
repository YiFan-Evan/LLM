[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This seems like a default value, but it might not be necessary if we assume that the `id` will always be valid.\n2. **Loop**: The loop iterates through the array using a while loop, which is fine, but a for loop would be more idiomatic in Python.\n3. **Condition Check**: The condition `if p == id` checks if the current index `p` matches the given `id`.
