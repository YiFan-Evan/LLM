The loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration can be described as follows:\n\n**Loop Invariant for the `i-th` Iteration:**\n\"At the start of the `i-th` iteration, the subarray `arr[0...i-1]` is sorted.\"\n\n### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - The outer loop starts with `i = 1` because a single element (the first element) is trivially sorted.\n   - `key = arr[i]` stores the value of the current element that needs to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array.\n\n2. **Inner Loop:**\n   - The inner loop compares the `key` with elements in the sorted portion of the array (from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]`).\n   - If `arr[j] > key`, it shifts `arr[j]` to the right by one position (`arr[j + 1] = arr[j]`).\n   - This process continues until we find the correct position for `key` or reach the beginning of the array.\n\n3. **Insertion:**\n   - Once the correct position is found (when `arr[j] <= key`), `key` is inserted at `arr[j + 1]`.\n\n4. **Repeat:**\n   - The outer loop then increments `i` and repeats the process for the next element.\n\n### Example Walkthrough:\nConsider the array `[5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]`.\n\n- **First Iteration (i = 1):**\n  - `key = 2`\n  - Compare `2` with `5` (no swap needed)\n  - Insert `2` before `5` resulting in `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`\n\n- **Second Iteration (i = 2):**\n  - `key = 9`\n  - No changes needed since `9` is already greater than `5`\n  - Array remains `[2, 5, 9, 1, 5, 6]`\n\n- **Third Iteration (i = 3):**\n  - `key = 1`\n  - Compare `1` with `9`, then with `5`, then with `2`\n  - Shift `9`, `5`, and `2` to the right\n  - Insert `1` at the beginning resulting in `[1, 2, 5, 9, 5, 6]`\n\n- **Fourth Iteration (i = 4):**\n  - `key = 5`\n  - Compare `5` with `9`, then with `5`\n  - Shift `9` to the right\n  - Insert `5` before `9` resulting in `[1, 2, 5, 5, 9, 6]`\n\n- **Fifth Iteration (i = 5):**\n  - `key = 6`\n  - Compare `6` with `9`, then with `5`\n  - Shift `9` and `5` to the right\n  - Insert `6` before `9` resulting in `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`\n\nThus, the final sorted array is `[1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        j += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "It looks like there are a few issues with the provided code for insertion sort. Specifically, the variable `i` is not defined within the scope of the loop, and the logic for the inner while loop needs to be corrected. Here's a corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how this works:\n\n1. The outer loop starts from the second element (index 1) and iterates through each element of the array.\n2. For each element at index `i`, we store its value in `key`.\n3. We then compare `key` with the elements before it (those in the sorted portion of the array).\n4. If an element in the sorted portion is greater than `key`, we shift that element one position to the right.\n5. This process continues until we find the correct position for `key`.\n6. Once the correct position is found, we insert `key` into that position.\n7. The array is gradually built up as sorted elements are moved to their correct positions.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted by the end of the function."}]
