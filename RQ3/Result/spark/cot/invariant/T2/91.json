[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Let's break down how it works and then provide a loop invariant for its while loop.\n\n### Function Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `last_value` is initialized to the first element of the array `arr[0]`.\n   - `l` is initialized to 0, which will be used as the index to traverse the array.\n\n2. **While Loop**:\n   - The loop continues as long as `l` is less than the length of the array `len(arr)`.\n   - In each iteration, `last_value` is updated to the current element `arr[l]`.\n   - `l` is incremented by 1 to move to the next element.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - After the loop completes, `last_value` holds the value of the last element in the array.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\nA loop invariant is a condition that remains true at every iteration of the loop.
