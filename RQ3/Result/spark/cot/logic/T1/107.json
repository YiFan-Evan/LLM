Now we need to prove that Sam is a shumpus.\n4. From (15) Sam is a tumpus.\n5. From (7) Everything that is snowy and a tumpus is a shumpus, and since Sam is snowy (from 13) and Sam is a tumpus (from 15), it follows that Sam is a shumpus.\n6. Combining 2 (Sam is dull) and 5 (Sam is a shumpus), we have both parts of the requirement for (9).\n7.
