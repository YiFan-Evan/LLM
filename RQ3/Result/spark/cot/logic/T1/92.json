This matches the structure of premise (3), so we can apply it:\n- (3) -> Max is a grimpus.\n\nStep 2: Now that we have established that Max is a grimpus, we can combine this with the fact that Max is loud (premise 12) and discordant (premise 17). These three properties together match the structure of premise (2):\n- (2) -> Max is a numpus.\n\nHowever, our goal is not to prove that Max is a numpus but to prove that he is loud, discordant, and a grimpus. Since we already know from Step 1 that Max is a grimpus, and we know from premises (12) and (17) that Max is loud and discordant, we can directly state:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(3),(12),(13),(15),(17),(18)->(20)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

Let's break down the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**: We need to find premises that describe Max as having the properties of being loud, discordant, and a grimpus.\n\n2. **Analyze Each Premise**:\n   - Premise (12): Max is loud.\n   - Premise (17): Max is discordant.\n   - Premise (3): Everything that is bright and dull and an impus is a grimpus.\n   - Premise (13): Max is dull.\n   - Premise (18): Max is bright.\n   - Premise (15): Max is an impus.\n\n3. **Combine Relevant Information**:\n   - From premises (13), (18), and (15), we can conclude that Max is bright, dull, and an impus. This matches the structure of premise (3).\n   - Applying premise (3) to the above conclusion, we get that Max is a grimpus.\n\n4. **Combine All Properties**:\n   - Since Max is loud (premise 12), discordant (premise 17), and a grimpus (derived from premises 3, 13, 15, and 18), we can combine these properties to describe Max.\n\nTherefore, using the relevant premises, we can prove that Max is loud, discordant, and a grimpus.
