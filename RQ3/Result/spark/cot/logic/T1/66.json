Let's analyze each premise step by step:\n\n1. **(1) Everything that is floral or a sterpus is an impus.**\n   - This tells us about the relationship between being floral, a sterpus, and being an impus, but it doesn't directly relate to Rex being kind or a rompus.\n\n2. **(2) Everything that is kind or a rompus is a brimpus.**\n   - This premise directly connects being kind or a rompus with being a brimpus. It's crucial for our proof because it mentions the term \"kind\" which is part of what we need to prove.\n\n3. **(3) Everything that is temperate or a gorpus is a rompus.**\n   - This establishes a relationship between being temperate or a gorpus and being a rompus. Since Rex is mentioned as a gorpus in (6), this could be useful.\n\n4. **(4) Everything that is opaque or a rompus is a shumpus.**\n   - This connects being opaque or a rompus with being a shumpus. Although it mentions rompus, it seems less directly relevant to proving Rex is kind or a rompus without additional connections.\n\n5. **(5) Everything that is fast or a gorpus is a lempus.**\n   - This links being fast or a gorpus with being a lempus. Given Rex is a gorpus, this could potentially help if combined with other premises.\n\n6. **(6) Rex is a gorpus.**\n   - This is a direct statement about Rex, establishing him as a gorpus.\n\n7. **(7) Rex is a sterpus.**\n   - Another direct statement about Rex, establishing him as a sterpus.\n\nNow, let's combine these premises to reach our goal:\n\n- Starting with (6) and (7), we know Rex is both a sterpus and a gorpus.\n- From (1), since Rex is a sterpus, he is an impus. However, this doesn't help us prove he's kind or a rompus.\n- From (5), since Rex is a gorpus, he is also a lempus. Again, this doesn't directly help our proof obligation but sets up another property of Rex.\n- The key lies in connecting Rex's status as a gorpus (from (6)) with the concept of being a rompus. According to (3), everything that is a gorpus is a rompus. Therefore, Rex, being a gorpus, must also be a rompus.\n- Now, using (2), since Rex is a rompus, and everything that is kind or a rompus is a brimpus, we can infer that Rex is either kind or already established as a rompus, satisfying the disjunction in our proof obligation.\n\nTherefore, combining (2), (3), (6), and (7), we have successfully derived that Rex is kind or a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(3),(6),(7)->(8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
