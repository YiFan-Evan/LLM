According to Premise 3, every grimpus is also a tumpus and a shumpus. Therefore, since Fae is a grimpus, Fae must also be a shumpus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises required to prove that Fae is a shumpus is:\n- Premise 3: Each grimpus is a tumpus and a shumpus.\n- Premise 9: Fae is a tumpus and a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ (3),(9) \\rightarrow (10) \\]"}]
