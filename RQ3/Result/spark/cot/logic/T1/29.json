We start by identifying any direct statements about Wren:\n   - Premise (14) states that Wren is either a yumpus, dumpus, tumpus, or numpus.\n   - Premise (15) also states that Wren is either a dumpus, tumpus, numpus, or brimpus.\n\n2. Next, we look for any connections between these categories and the term \"impus\":\n   - From premise (1), we know that shumpuses are impuses. However, there's no direct mention of shumpuses in the premises about Wren.\n   - Premise (2) tells us that each brimpus is a sterpus, but it doesn't directly connect brimpuses to impuses.\n   - Premise (3) states that each gorpus is an impus, but there's no mention of gorpus in relation to Wren.\n   - Premise (4) states that rompuses are impuses, but again, no connection to Wren.\n   - Premise (5) reiterates that each brimpus is an impus, reinforcing the connection between brimpuses and impuses.\n   - Premise (6) states that numpuses are impuses, which is relevant since Wren could be a numpus.\n   - Premise (7) states that tumpuses are sterpuses, which means if Wren is a tumpus, then Wren is a sterpus.\n   - Premise (8) states that dumpuses are impuses, which is also relevant since Wren could be a dumpus.\n   - Premise (9) states that each dumpus is a sterpus, reinforcing the connection between dumpuses and sterpuses.\n   - Premise (10) states that wumpuses are impuses, but there's no direct mention of wumpus in relation to Wren.\n   - Premise (11) states that tumpuses are impuses, which is relevant if Wren is a tumpus.\n   - Premise (12) states that every yumpus is a sterpus, which means if Wren is a yumpus, then Wren is a sterpus.\n   - Premise (13) states that numpuses are sterpuses, which means if Wren is a numpus, then Wren is a sterpus.\n\n3. Now, let's combine the relevant information:\n   - If Wren is a numpus (from premise 14 or 15), then according to premise (6), Wren is an impus.\n   - If Wren is a dumpus (from premise 14 or 15), then according to premise (8), Wren is an impus.\n   - If Wren is a tumpus (from premise 14 or 15), then according to premise (11), Wren is an impus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises that leads to the conclusion that \"Wren is an impus\" is:\n(6),(8),(11),(14),(15)->(16)\n\nThis combination covers all possible categories that Wren could be, as stated in premises (14) and (15), and connects them to being an impus through premises (6), (8), and (11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

We'll start by examining the premises related to Wren and then connect them to the conclusion that Wren is an impus.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises for Wren**:\n   - Premise (14): Wren is a yumpus or a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus.\n   - Premise (15): Wren is a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus or a brimpus.\n\n2. **Examine Each Category Wren Could Be**:\n   - **If Wren is a Numpus**:\n     - According to premise (6), numpuses are impuses.\n     - Therefore, if Wren is a numpus, Wren is an impus.\n\n   - **If Wren is a Dumpus**:\n     - According to premise (8), dumpuses are impuses.\n     - Therefore, if Wren is a dumpus, Wren is an impus.\n\n   - **If Wren is a Tumpus**:\n     - According to premise (11), tumpuses are impuses.\n     - Therefore, if Wren is a tumpus, Wren is an impus.\n\n   - **If Wren is a Yumpus**:\n     - According to premise (12), every yumpus is a sterpus.\n     - Since being a sterpus does not directly imply being an impus, we need another connection.\n     - From premise (9), each dumpus is a sterpus.\n     - Combining this with premise (8), dumpuses are impuses, so every sterpus that is a dumpus is an impus.\n     - However, not all sterpuses are dumpuses, so we cannot conclude that all yumpuses (and therefore all sterpuses) are impuses.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - Since Wren can be a numpus, dumpus, or tumpus, and all these categories are impuses according to the premises, we can conclude that Wren is an impus regardless of which of these categories Wren falls into.\n   - The only category left, brimpus, is not directly stated to be an impus in the premises, so it does not contribute to proving that Wren is an impus.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ (6),(8),(11),(14),(15) \\rightarrow (16) \\]\n\nThis sequence shows that if Wren is a numpus, dumpus, or tumpus, then Wren is an impus based on the given premises."}]
