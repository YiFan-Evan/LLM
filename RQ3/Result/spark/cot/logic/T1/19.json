Sally is a vumpus and a rompus.\n\nNow, let's start deriving information step by step:\n\nFrom (9), we know that Sally is a jompus and a sterpus. Since jompuses are not directly related to gorpuses or yumpuses in the given premises, we can't derive any further information about Sally being a gorpus from this fact alone.\n\nHowever, from (10), we know that Sally is also a vumpus and a rompus. This gives us more information to work with.\n\nFrom (7), we know that rompuses are vumpuses and gorpuses. Since Sally is a rompus (from (10)), it follows that Sally is also a gorpus.\n\nNow, from (3), we know that every gorpus is a yumpus and a wumpus. Since Sally is now proven to be a gorpus, it follows that Sally must also be a yumpus and a wumpus.\n\nTherefore, by combining the information from (3) and the derived fact that Sally is a gorpus, we can conclude that Sally is a gorpus.\n\nThus, the final answer is: (7),(10),(3)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
