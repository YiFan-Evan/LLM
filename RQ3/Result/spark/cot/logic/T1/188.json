It does not directly mention Rex.\n\n(3) Rompuses are impuses.\nThis premise tells us that rompuses are impuses. It does not directly mention Rex.\n\n(4) Everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is an impus.\nThis premise tells us that if something is a lorpus, gorpus, or grimpus, then it is also an impus. This could be relevant if we can establish that Rex is one of these.\n\n(5) Each jompus is a grimpus.\nThis premise tells us that jompuses are grimpuses.

It does not directly mention Rex.\n\n(8) Zumpuses are numpuses.\nThis premise tells us that zumpuses are numpuses. It does not directly mention Rex.\n\n(9) Rex is a shumpus.\nThis premise tells us that Rex is a shumpus.
