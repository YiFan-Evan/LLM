This creates a contradiction unless we disprove that Max is a yumpus due to being a lempus.\n3. To resolve this contradiction, let's use (14) again, which states that Max is a lempus, a shumpus, and a numpus.\n4. From (5), each shumpus is a sterpus. This doesn't directly help with proving Max is not an impus.\n5. However, from (10), numpuses are vumpuses. Since Max is a numpus (from (14)), he must also be a vumpus.\n6. Using (3), if Max is a zumpus, a wumpus, and a gorpus, then he is a vumpus. We already know Max is a zumpus (from (4), (15)), a wumpus (from (11)), and a gorpus (from (7), (13)). Thus, Max is definitely a vumpus.\n7. Now, if we assume Max were an impus, then by (8), he would have to be a grimpus (since he is a zumpus and a tumpus).
