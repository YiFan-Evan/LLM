Start by examining the proof obligation: Prove that Max is blue, orange, or a lempus.\n   - To prove this, we need to show that Max falls into one of these categories.\n\n2. Look for premises that relate Max to any of the mentioned characteristics (blue, orange, lempus).\n   - Premise (10) states that Max is a wumpus.\n   - Premise (11) states that Max is a gorpus.\n\n3. Check if there are any premises that connect being a wumpus or a gorpus to being blue, orange, or a lempus.\n   - Premise (8) states that everything that is windy, rainy, or a gorpus is a dumpus.\n     - This tells us nothing about Max being blue, orange, or a lempus.\n   - Premise (9) states that everything that is transparent, opaque, or a wumpus is a grimpus.\n     - This also doesn't help us with proving that Max is blue, orange, or a lempus.\n\n4. Since none of the direct connections from being a wumpus or a gorpus to being blue, orange, or a lempus were found, we need to consider indirect connections.\n   - Premise (3) states that everything that is aggressive or angry or a gorpus is a lempus.\n     - This connects Max being a gorpus to being a lempus.\n\n5. Now we have established that Max is a lempus.\n   - Premise (2) states that everything that is blue or orange or a lempus is a tumpus.\n     - Since Max is a lempus, he must also be a tumpus.\n\n6. We now need to connect being a tumpus to being blue, orange, or a lempus.\n   - Premise (7) states that everything that is moderate or slow or a tumpus is an impus.\n     - This tells us that Max being a tumpus implies he is an impus.\n\n7. Finally, we need to connect being an impus to being blue, orange, or a lempus.\n   - Premise (6) states that everything that is discordant or melodic or an impus is a yumpus.\n     - This tells us that Max being an impus implies he is a yumpus.\n\n8.
