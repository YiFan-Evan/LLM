Max is a gorpus.\n\nWe need to show that Max is not moderate, which means we need to find a chain of reasoning that connects Max to the property of being not moderate.\n\nFrom premise 23, we know that Max is a brimpus. From premise 6, we know that every brimpus is a numpus. Therefore, Max is a numpus. From premise 17, we know that numpuses are dumpuses. Therefore, Max is a dumpus. From premise 24, we know that Max is a gorpus. From premise 5, we know that each gorpus is a tumpus. Therefore, Max is a tumpus. However, these facts alone do not directly lead us to the conclusion that Max is not moderate.\n\nNow, let's consider the wumpuses. From premise 20, we know that every wumpus is a lorpus. From premise 8, we know that every wumpus is not moderate. Therefore, if we can show that Max is a wumpus, then we can conclude that Max is not moderate.\n\nFrom premise 24, we know that Max is a gorpus. From premise 5, we know that each gorpus is a tumpus. However, there is no direct link between being a tumpus and being a wumpus in the given premises. Therefore, we cannot use this path to show that Max is a wumpus.\n\nInstead, let's consider the brimpuses again. From premise 23, we know that Max is a brimpus. From premise 11, we know that brimpuses are vumpuses. From premise 9, we know that vumpuses are temperate. However, there is no direct link between being temperate and being not moderate in the given premises. Therefore, we cannot use this path to show that Max is not moderate either.\n\nFinally, let's consider the connection between brimpuses and wumpuses through other categories. From premise 23, we know that Max is a brimpus. From premise 6, we know that every brimpus is a numpus. From premise 12, we know that each numpus is a lempus. From premise 19, we know that lempuses are zumpuses. From premise 22, we know that zumpuses are wumpuses. Therefore, Max is a wumpus. From premise 8, we know that every wumpus is not moderate. Therefore, Max is not moderate.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premise propositions needed to derive the proof obligation is (6), (12), (19), (22), (23), (8).
