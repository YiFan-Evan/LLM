Let's analyze the premises step by step:\n\n1. From premises (9), (11), and (12), we can combine Stella's properties of being a brimpus, moderate, and slow. According to premise (2), anything that is slow, moderate, and a brimpus is a sterpus. Therefore, we can conclude:\n   - Stella is a sterpus.\n\n2. From premises (8) and (10), we know Stella is fruity and floral. Since she is also a brimpus (premise 9), according to premise (4), anything that is fruity, floral, and a brimpus is a tumpus. Therefore, we can conclude:\n   - Stella is a tumpus.\n\n3. Now, we have established that Stella is a tumpus. We also know from premises (13) and (14) that Stella is dull and bright.
