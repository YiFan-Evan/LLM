Let's break down the necessary steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**: We start by identifying the premises that directly mention Sally and those that can help us establish a connection between being a grimpus and being dull.\n\n   - Sally is a numpus (Premise 15).\n   - Sally is a grimpus (Premise 16).\n   - Every grimpus is a brimpus (Premise 4).\n   - Every brimpus is a rompus (Premise 13).\n   - Rompuses are dumpuses (Premise 14).\n   - Rompuses are dull (Premise 2).\n\n2. **Form a Chain of Reasoning**:\n   - Since Sally is a grimpus (Premise 16), and every grimpus is a brimpus (Premise 4), it follows that Sally is a brimpus.\n   - Next, since every brimpus is a rompus (Premise 13), Sally is also a rompus.\n   - Furthermore, since rompuses are dumpuses (Premise 14), Sally is a dumpus.\n   - Finally, since rompuses are dull (Premise 2), and Sally is a rompus, it follows that Sally is dull.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: By linking these premises together, we have established that Sally is dull.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (15),(16),(4),(13),(14),(2)->(17)."}]
