This means there is an inconsistency in the information provided about Rex being a gorpus. Therefore, this path does not help us directly prove that Rex is not a jompus.\n\nNext, let's explore other paths using the information about jompuses:\n- From Premise 6, every jompus is also a numpus.\n- From Premise 5, all numpuses are jompuses.\n- Combining these, if something is a jompus, it must be a numpus.\n\nNow, consider Rex's properties:\n- From Premise 12, Rex is explicitly stated to be a zumpus, but not mentioned as a jompus or numpus.\n\nSince being a jompus implies being a numpus (from Premises 5 and 6), and Rex is not stated to be either a jompus or a numpus in any of the premises, we can infer that Rex cannot be a jompus. This inference relies on the absence of direct statements linking Rex to being a jompus or numpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the analysis above, the minimal set of premises needed to derive that Rex is not a jompus would be:\n- (5), (6), (12)\n\nThese premises collectively show that being a jompus necessitates being a numpus, and since Rex is not stated to be a numpus or a jompus anywhere in the premises, we can conclude that Rex is not a jompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ (5), (6), (12) \\rightarrow (14) \\]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

It does not contribute directly to proving whether Rex is a jompus.\n\n2. **(1) Rex is a zumpus.**\n   - Direct information about Rex being a specific type of creature.\n\n3. **(2) Dumpuses are zumpuses.**\n   - This establishes a relationship between dumpuses and zumpuses but does not directly relate to jompuses.\n\n4. **(3) Every jompus is a brimpus.**\n   - This states that all jompuses have an additional property of being brimpuses, but it doesn't exclude Rex from being a jompus.\n\n5. **(5) Numpuses are gorpuses, grimpuses, and jompuses.**\n   - This indicates that all numpuses are also jompuses, among other things.\n\n6. **(6) Every jompus is a wumpus, a dumpus, and a numpus.**\n   - This further defines the properties of jompuses, showing they must also be wumpuses, dumpuses, and numpuses.\n\n7. **(7) Grimpuses are sterpuses.**\n   - This relates to another type of creature but does not involve jompuses or Rex.\n\n8. **(8) Rompuses are zumpuses.**\n   - This adds another type of creature (rompus) as a zumpus, but does not relate to jompuses.\n\n9. **(9) Each wumpus is a tumpus.**\n   - This states that all wumpuses are also tumpuses, which might be relevant if we can link Rex being a tumpus to him not being a jompus.\n\n10. **(10) Numpuses are lorpuses.**\n    - This adds another property (being a lorpus) to numpuses, which might be relevant since numpuses are also jompuses.\n\n11. **(11) Every vumpus is a lorpus.**\n    - This states that all vumpuses are lorpuses, which might be relevant if we can link Rex being a vumpus to him not being a jompus.\n\n12. **(12) Rex is a tumpus, a zumpus, and a yumpus.**\n    - This provides more direct information about Rex, stating he is a tumpus and a zumpus.\n\n13. **(13) Rex is a vumpus and Rex is not a gorpus and Rex is a rompus.**\n    - This provides additional information about Rex being a vumpus, not a gorpus, and a rompus.\n\n### Proof by Contradiction:\nWe will use proof by contradiction to show that Rex cannot be a jompus. Assume Rex is a jompus.\n\n1. If Rex is a jompus, then by Premise (6), Rex must also be a wumpus, a dumpus, and a numpus.\n2. By Premise (9), since Rex is a wumpus, he must also be a tumpus.\n3. However, Premise (12) already states that Rex is a tumpus, which is consistent with our assumption.\n4. But by Premise (5), if Rex is a numpus, he must also be a gorpus, grimpus, and jompus.\n5. Premise (13) states that Rex is not a gorpus, which contradicts the implication from Premise (5).\n\nSince assuming Rex is a jompus leads to a contradiction (Rex being both a gorpus and not a gorpus), we conclude that Rex cannot be a jompus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal set of premises needed to prove that Rex is not a jompus is:\n\\[ (5), (6), (9), (12), (13) \\]\n\nThese premises collectively"}]
