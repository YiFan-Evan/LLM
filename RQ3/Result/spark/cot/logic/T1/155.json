Rex is a lorpus.\n2. Every wumpus is a lempus and a gorpus and an impus.\n3. Each gorpus is a rompus.\n4. Each sterpus is an impus.\n5. Wumpuses are tumpuses.\n6.

Rex is a yumpus.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce:\n\n- Rex is a lorpus (premise 1).\n- Rex is a vumpus (premise 15).\n- Rex is a numpus (premise 19).\n- Rex is a yumpus (premise 20).\n- Rex is a dumpus (premise 10).\n\nUsing premise 8, since Rex is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus, it follows that:\n(8) -> Rex is a lorpus (which we already know from premise 1).\n\nNow, let's use premise 9:\n(9) -> Since Rex is a lorpus (premise 1), a vumpus (premise 15), and a dumpus (premise 10), it follows that Rex is a tumpus.\n\nNext, using premise 5:\n(5) -> Since Rex is a tumpus (from above deduction), and tumpuses are wumpuses, Rex is a wumpus.\n\nUsing premise 11:\n(11) -> Since Rex is a wumpus (from above deduction), and lempuses are wumpuses, it follows that Rex is a lempus.\n\nHowever, this contradicts the proof obligation that Rex is not a lempus. Therefore, there must be an error in our deduction or in the premises provided. Let's check if there's any premise that contradicts the deduction that Rex is a lempus:\n\nUsing premise 12:\n(12) -> Rex is a sterpus.\n\nUsing premise 4:\n(4) -> Since Rex is a sterpus (premise 12), it follows that Rex is an impus.\n\nUsing premise 13:\n(13) -> Shumpuses are not impuses. This means that if Rex were a shumpus, he couldn't be an impus. But we already established that Rex is an impus (from premise 4), so Rex cannot be a shumpus.\n\nUsing premise 6:\n(6) -> Since Rex is not a shumpus (from above deduction), it follows that Rex cannot be simultaneously a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus. However, we know from premises 15, 19, and 20 that Rex is indeed a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus, which means Rex must be a shumpus according to premise 6.\n\nThis creates a contradiction because Rex cannot be both a shumpus and not a shumpus at the same time. Thus, the only way to resolve this contradiction is to conclude that Rex cannot be a lempus, as being a lempus would lead to the contradiction that Rex is both a shumpu"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

According to (8), if something is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus, then it is a lorpus. Since Rex is already established as a lorpus in (1), this is consistent.\n- From (10) and (16), we know that Rex is a dumpus and every lempus is a dumpus. However, this does not directly imply that Rex is a lempus because the converse of being a dumpus does not necessarily mean Rex is a lempus.\n- From (12) and (4), we know that Rex is a sterpus and every sterpus is an impus, so Rex is an impus.\n- From (2), (11), and (7), we know that every wumpus is a lempus and each lempus is a rompus.
