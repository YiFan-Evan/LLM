Let's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Premises Involving Rex\nFrom the given premises, we know about Rex:\n- Proposition 10: Rex is a numpus.\n- Proposition 11: Rex is a rompus.\n\n### Step 2: Use Rex's Properties to Derive Further Information\nWe can use proposition 10 and proposition 8 to derive more information about Rex:\n- Proposition 8 states that everything that is aggressive or a numpus is a brimpus. Since Rex is a numpus (proposition 10), it follows that Rex is a brimpus.\n\nNow, using proposition 11 and proposition 2:\n- Proposition 2 states that everything that is small or a rompus is a wumpus. Since Rex is a rompus (proposition 11), it follows that Rex is a wumpus.\n\n### Step 3: Connect Rex\u2019s Properties to Transparent or Jompus\nNext, we need to connect Rex's properties to being transparent or a jompus. We know Rex is a wumpus and a brimpus, but these don't directly help us with transparency or being a jompus. However, let's explore other premises for potential connections.\n\nWe see that:\n- Proposition 5 states that everything that is discordant or a tumpus is a zumpus.\n- Proposition 6 states that everything that is floral or a zumpus is a dumpus.\n- Proposition 9 states that everything that is metallic or a tumpus is a yumpus.\n- Proposition 7 states that everything that is slow or a jompus is a lempus.\n\nNone of these directly connect Rex's properties (numpus, rompus, brimpus, wumpus) to being transparent or a jompus.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Any Direct Connections to Transparency or Being a Jompus\nSince none of the derived properties (brimpus, wumpus) connect directly to transparency or being a jompus, we need to check if there's any direct connection from the original premises:\n- Proposition 3 states that everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus.\n- Proposition 4 states that everything that is spicy or a numpus is a jompus.\n\nSince Rex is a numpus (proposition 10), it follows from proposition 4 that Rex is a jompus.\n\n### Step 5: Conclude Using Proposition 3\nSince Rex is a jompus (from proposition 4), and proposition 3 states that everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus, it follows that Rex is either transparent or a jompus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the conclusion \"Rex is transparent or a jompus\" is:\n\\[ \\text{(4), (10) -> (12) } \\]\n\nThis means:\n- Proposition 4: Everything that is spicy or a numpus is a jompus.\n- Proposition 10: Rex is a numpus.\n- These lead to the conclusion (Proposition 12): Rex is transparent or a jompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\text{(4), (10) -> (12) } \\]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
