Let's analyze and apply the given information step by step:\n\n1. **Understanding the Premises**:\n   - Sally has various attributes like being a yumpus, dumpus, shumpus, vumpus, etc.\n   - There are several conditions linking these attributes with rompus, lempus, and other terms.\n\n2. **Identifying Relevant Premises**:\n   - We need to find which premises directly or indirectly relate to Sally not being a wumpus.\n\n3. **Applying the Premises**:\n   - From (1), (6), (13), and (14), we know Sally is a yumpus, vumpus, impus, and shumpus.\n   - From (7), since Sally is a vumpus, yumpus, and shumpus, she must be a lempus.\n   - From (9), if something is a vumpus, wumpus, and impus, it is a lempus. But Sally is already a lempus from being a vumpus, yumpus, and shumpus. This does not directly help us determine if Sally is a wumpus.\n   - From (2) and (8), being a vumpus, wumpus, impus makes one a rompus, and each dumpus is a rompus. Since Sally is a dumpus, she is a rompus.\n   - From (12), it explicitly states that Sally is not a rompus, contradicting the previous inference. This means there's an error or conflict in our application of the premises so far.\n\n4. **Resolving the Conflict**:\n   - The conflict arises because Sally being a dumpus implies she is a rompus, but (12) states she is not a rompus. This suggests that either the premise about dumpus leading to rompus (8) is incorrect or there's another condition we haven't considered.\n   - However, without additional information or corrections to the premises, we can't directly resolve this conflict based on the given information.\n\n5. **Proving the Conclusion**:\n   - To prove Sally is not a wumpus, we need a premise that directly states this or derives it from the given information. None of the premises directly state that Sally is not a wumpus, nor do they provide a clear path to this conclusion without resolving the existing conflict.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Based on the given premises and the analysis above, we cannot definitively prove that Sally is not a wumpus without additional information or correcting the apparent contradiction in the premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

This creates a contradiction unless there's another condition that overrides (8).\n   - From (2) and (9), being a vumpus, wumpus, and impus makes one a rompus. Since Sally is a vumpus (from (6)) and an impus (from (14)), if she were also a wumpus, she would be a rompus, which contradicts (12).\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - To avoid the contradiction with Sally not being a rompus, we must conclude that Sally cannot be a wumpus.
