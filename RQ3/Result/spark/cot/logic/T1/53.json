If Max were a numpus, then he would be a rompus.\n- However, there is no direct evidence from the premises provided that explicitly states Max is not a numpus. The closest we get is that if he were a numpus, he would also be a rompus due to premise 8.\n\nSince there's no direct evidence in the premises to conclude that Max is not a numpus, we cannot derive this conclusion solely based on the given information.

Additionally, being a numpus also implies being a rompus.\n\n### Relevant Information about Max:\n\n- **Premise 13** directly states that Max is a brimpus.\n- **Premise 14** and **Premise 15** state that Max is both a tumpus and a lorpus.\n- **Premise 2** and **Premise 12** state that Max is a yumpus.\n- **Premise 6** states that Max is an impus.\n- **Premise 9** states that Max is a lempus.\n- **Premise 3** states that Max is a wumpus.\n\n### Contradiction Check:\n\nSince Max is a wumpus (Premise 3), he is a grimpus (Premise 7). If Max were also a numpus, then he would be a brimpus (Premise 5), which he already is (Premise 13). However, being a numpus would also imply being a rompus (Premise 8). There is no direct statement that Max is a rompus or a dumpus or a vumpus, but this does not necessarily disprove the possibility.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nGiven the information provided, there is no direct evidence that explicitly states Max is not a numpus. The premises do not provide sufficient information to prove or disprove whether Max is a numpus. Therefore, based on the given premises, we cannot conclude that Max is not a numpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Based on the given premises, we cannot prove (16) Max is not a numpus."}]
