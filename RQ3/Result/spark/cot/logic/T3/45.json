However, these classifications do not directly help in proving that Alex is luminous or a numpus.\n\n**Additional Premises to Consider:**\n- (8) Everything that is large or a zumpus is a numpus. Since Alex is a zumpus, **Alex is a numpus**.\n\n**Combining Results:**\n- We have established that **Alex is a numpus**.\n- The proof obligation states that Alex is either luminous or a numpus.\n\nSince we have already proven that Alex is a numpus, this directly satisfies the proof obligation. Therefore, we do not need to prove that Alex is luminous.\n\n### Final Proof:\nBased on the above analysis, the minimal set of premises required to derive the proof obligation is:\n\n- (8),(11)->(12)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{(8),(11) \\rightarrow (12)} \\]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Alex is luminous or a numpus then Taylor is a visionary.
