Start by identifying the properties of Sally:\n   - From (9), Sally is a jompus and a sterpus.\n   - From (10), Sally is a vumpus and a rompus.\n\n2. Use these properties to find more information about Sally:\n   - From (7), rompuses are vumpuses and gorpuses. Since Sally is a rompus, she must also be a vumpus and a gorpus.\n   - From (6), vumpuses are grimpuses and lorpuses. Since Sally is a vumpus, she must also be a grimpus and a lorpus.\n\n3. Now we have that Sally is a sterpus, jompus, rompus, vumpus, gorpus, grimpus, and lorpus.\n\n4. Next, we look for connections between any of these classes and the class of gorpuses:\n   - From (3), every gorpus is a yumpus and a wumpus. This means that to be a gorpus, one must be both a yumpus and a wumpus.\n\n5. We need to see if Sally can be classified as a yumpus or a wumpus based on her current classifications:\n   - From (1), yumpuses are sterpuses and jompuses. Since Sally is a sterpus and a jompus, she is also a yumpus.\n\n6. Finally, we need to check if Sally can be classified as a wumpus:\n   - There isn't a direct relationship given in the premises between any of Sally's current classifications (sterpus, jompus, rompus, vumpus, gorpus, grimpus, lorpus) and being a wumpus. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Sally is a wumpus based on the given information.\n\nSince being a gorpus requires being both a yumpus and a wumpus, and while we have established that Sally is a yumpus, we cannot confirm that she is a wumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10)->(11) is not valid because we cannot prove that Sally is a gorpus based on the given premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is a gorpus then Taylor is a visionary.
