Zumpuses are numpuses.\n9. Rex is a shumpus.\n10. Rex is a jompus.\n\nNow, let's break down the proof step-by-step:\n\nFirst, we know from premise (10) that Rex is a jompus. According to premise (5), each jompus is a grimpus. Therefore, Rex is a grimpus.\n\nNext, since Rex is a grimpus, and according to premise (7), everything that is a grimpus is a numpus, Rex must be a numpus.\n\nFrom premise (9), we also know that Rex is a shumpus. According to premise (2), everything that is a shumpus is an impus, so Rex is an impus.\n\nSince Rex is an impus and a grimpus, and according to premise (4), everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is an impus, Rex must be one of these three (lorpus, gorpus, or grimpus). Since we already established that Rex is a grimpus, this confirms our previous finding.\n\nNow, from premise (1), we know that everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is also a wumpus. Therefore, since Rex is a grimpus, Rex must also be a wumpus.\n\nAt this point, we have proven that Rex is a wumpus. This satisfies the proof obligation (11), which states that Rex is a tumpus or a dumpus or a wumpus. Since we have proven that Rex is a wumpus, we don't need to consider whether Rex is a tumpus or a dumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(1),(5),(7),(9),(10)->(11)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Rex is a tumpus or a dumpus or a wumpus then Taylor is a visionary.

Rex is a jompus.\n\nNow, let's use these premises to derive the desired conclusion:\n\nFirst, from premise (11), we know that Rex is a jompus. According to premise (6), each jompus is a grimpus. Therefore, Rex is a grimpus.\n\nNext, since Rex is a grimpus, and according to premise (2), everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is also a wumpus. Therefore, Rex is a wumpus.\n\nSince Rex is a wumpus, and according to premise (3), everything that is a wumpus, a shumpus, or a sterpus is an impus. Since Rex is also a shumpus (premise 10), this confirms that Rex is an impus.\n\nNow, we have established that Rex is a wumpus. This directly satisfies the condition in premise (1) that if Rex is a tumpus or a dumpus or a wumpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, by applying premise (1), we conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n(1),(2),(3),(10),(11)->(12)"}]
