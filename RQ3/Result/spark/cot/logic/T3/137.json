Use these facts to connect Max to other categories:\n   - From Premise 1, since Max is a tumpus, and everything that is brown, blue, or a tumpus is a dumpus, we can conclude that Max is a dumpus. However, this does not help us prove that Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus.\n   - From Premise 5, since Max is a sterpus, and everything that is melodic or discordant or a sterpus is a jompus, we can conclude that Max is a jompus.

Since Max is a tumpus (Premise 6), it follows that Max is a lorpus.\n\n4. With this new information, we can now connect Max to the proof obligation:\n   - From Premise 2, everything that is luminous or wooden or a lorpus is a gorpus.

Finally, we can conclude that:\n   - Since Max is a lorpus, and being a lorpus is part of the condition for being luminous or wooden or a lorpus, we can conclude that Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (3),(6)->(8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus then Taylor is a visionary.
