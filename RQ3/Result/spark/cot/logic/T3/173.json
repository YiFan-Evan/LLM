From premise (1), we know that each sterpus is a jompus. Therefore, if someone is a zumpus, they must also be a jompus. This can be stated as:\n\n(A) If X is a zumpus, then X is a jompus.\n\nFrom premise (14), we know Fae is a wumpus. According to premise (11), wumpuses are lempuses. Therefore, Fae is also a lempus.

Therefore, if someone is an impus, they must also be a lempus. This can be stated as:\n\n(C) If Y is an impus, then Y is a lempus.\n\nSince we have established from (B) that Fae is a lempus, and from (A) and (C) that being a zumpus or an impus would make Fae a lempus, we can deduce that Fae cannot be a zumpus because if Fae were a zumpus, it would contradict the fact that Fae is already a lempus (from B). This is because being a zumpus would imply being a jompus (from A), and being an impus would also imply being a lempus (from C), which Fae already is.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination and contradiction, we conclude:\n\n(15) Fae is not a zumpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Fae is not a zumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
