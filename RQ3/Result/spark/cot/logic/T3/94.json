Since Max is a vumpus, it follows that Max is a lorpus.\n   - Premise (6) states that Max is a grimpus.\n   - Premise (5) indicates that everything that is shy or a grimpus is a tumpus. Since Max is a grimpus, it follows that Max is a tumpus.\n   - Now, we have established that Max is both a lorpus and a tumpus. However, these facts do not directly help us prove that Max is sour or a tumpus.\n   - We need to find a connection between being a tumpus and being sour or a tumpus.\n   - Premise (4) states that everything that is sour or a tumpus is a gorpus. This means if Max were sour or a tumpus, he would be a gorpus.\n   - Since we already know Max is a tumpus, this directly implies that Max is either sour or a tumpus, because being a tumpus satisfies the condition \"sour or a tumpus\".\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that Max is sour or a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7)->(8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is sour or a tumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
