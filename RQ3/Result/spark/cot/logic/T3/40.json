Since Sally is a brimpus (from Premise 10), if Sally were also a shumpus, she would have to be all of those things simultaneously. However, since Sally is not a wumpus (from Premise 10), she cannot be a shumpus because being a shumpus implies being a wumpus (from Premise 4).\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Sally is not a shumpus based on the following chain of reasoning:\n(4),(10) -> Sally is not a shumpus.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n(4),(10) -> (11)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is not a shumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
