We can use this information to link Stella with other characteristics related to brimpuses:\n- (7) Each brimpus is a numpus.\n- (2) Every brimpus is a vumpus.\n- (3) Every brimpus is snowy.\n\nSince every brimpus is a numpus (7), and each numpus is cold (12):\n- Stella is a numpus, so Stella is cold.\n\nNow, from (2), we know every brimpus is a vumpus. Since Stella is a brimpus, she is also a vumpus. This allows us to link Stella with properties of vumpuses:\n- (19) Vumpuses are tumpuses.\n- (14) Every vumpus is wooden.\n\nSince every rompus is a dumpus (15), and every dumpus is nervous (16):\n- Rompuses are nervous.\n\nFrom (20), we know every grimpus is a rompus, which means every grimpus is nervous. But this doesn't directly help us with proving transparency.\n\nHowever, from (15) and (20), we know that every grimpus is a rompus, and every rompus is a dumpus. Since every dumpus is a gorpus (5), and every dumpus is nervous (16), this still doesn't directly lead us to transparency.\n\nLooking further, from (2), every brimpus is a vumpus, and from (19), vumpuses are tumpuses. So, Stella, being a brimpus, is also a tumpus. However, tumpuses are not spicy (1), but this doesn't help with proving transparency either.\n\nNow, considering (15) and (2), every rompus is a dumpus, and every brimpus is a vumpus. Since every dumpus is a gorpus (5), and every dumpus is nervous (16), and since every brimpus is a vumpus (2), and every vumpus is wooden (14), this chain of logic does not directly contribute to proving transparency.\n\nThe key lies in connecting Stella's identity as a brimpus with her being transparent. From (10), we know rompuses are transparent. Since every brimpus is a rompus (from the chain of (2) -> (15) -> (20)), and Stella is a brimpus (24), it follows that Stella is a rompus.\n\nTherefore, by the transitive property, Stella, being a rompus, is transparent.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Stella is transparent is:\n(2), (15), (20), (10), (24) -> (25)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2), (15), (20), (10), (24)->(25)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Stella is transparent then Taylor is a visionary.
