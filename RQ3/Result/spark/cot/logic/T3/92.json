Let's analyze the premises and see how they can be combined to reach the conclusion:\n\n1. Start with Max's properties:\n   - Max is loud (premise 12).\n   - Max is dull (premise 13).\n   - Max is large (premise 14).\n   - Max is an impus (premise 15).\n   - Max is small (premise 16).\n   - Max is discordant (premise 17).\n   - Max is bright (premise 18).\n   - Max is a shumpus (premise 19).\n\n2. We need to show that Max is loud and discordant and a grimpus.\n\n3. From premise (3), we know that everything that is bright and dull and an impus is a grimpus. Since Max is bright (premise 18), dull (premise 13), and an impus (premise 15), it follows that:\n   - Max is a grimpus.\n\n4. Now we combine Max being discordant and loud with him being a grimpus. From premise (2), we know that everything that is loud, discordant, and a grimpus is a numpus. Since Max is loud (premise 12), discordant (premise 17), and a grimpus (from step 3), it follows that:\n   - Max is a numpus.\n\n5. Finally, we need to show that Max is loud and discordant and a grimpus. Since we have already established that Max is a grimpus (step 3) and a numpus (step 4), and from premise (1) we know that everything that is spicy, sour, and a numpus is a jompus. However, there are no premises stating that Max is spicy or sour, so we cannot use this to prove that Max is a jompus.\n\n6. But we don't need to prove that Max is a jompus; we only need to prove that he is loud and discordant and a grimpus. From steps 3 and 4, we have established that Max is a grimpus and a numpus. Since being a numpus is not directly related to being loud and discordant, we focus on the properties of being loud and discordant.\n\n7. Since Max is already established as being loud (premise 12) and discordant (premise 17), and we have shown that he is also a grimpus (step 3), we can conclude that:\n   - Max is loud and discordant and a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(3),(12),(13),(15),(17),(18)->(20)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is loud and discordant and a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.
