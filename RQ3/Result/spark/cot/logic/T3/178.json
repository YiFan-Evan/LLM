This still doesn't directly help us prove that Fae is not sunny.\n\n4. **Using Fae as a lorpus again**: Since Fae is a lorpus and lorpuses are temperate (10), then Fae is temperate. While this is interesting, it still doesn't directly help us prove that Fae is not sunny.\n\n5. **Returning to Fae as a jompus**: Since Fae is a jompus and jompuses are shumpuses (13), then Fae is a shumpus.

However, the direct connection between rompuses and impuses doesn't seem immediately helpful for proving that Fae is not sunny.\n\n7. **Impuses and not being sunny**: We know from (7) that each impus is not sunny.

However, there doesn't seem to be a direct route from Fae to impus using the given premises.\n\n8. **Alternative route through Yumpuses and Vumpuses**: Since Fae is a jompus (24), and every jompus is a vumpus (22), then Fae is a vumpus. Vumpuses are yumpuses (8), and every yumpus is a sterpus (15). Sterpuses are not shy (6), but this doesn't help us with the \"not sunny\" property.\n\n9. **Another route through Grimpuses**: Since Fae is a jompus (24), and Grimpuses are jompuses (19), then Fae is also a Grimpus. Grimpuses are numpuses (9), and Numpuses are not opaque (14). However, this also doesn't help us with the \"not sunny\" property.\n\nGiven the premises provided, it seems impossible to directly derive that Fae is not sunny using the given set of propositions.
