The only direct connection we have is through the relationship of temperate and wumpus (Premise 2). However, there's no direct link from wumpus to vumpus.\n3. We know Stella is bright (Premise 16) and bright things that are a tumpus are vumpuses (Premise 9).\n4. Since Stella is a lempus (Premise 14), and loud lorpus are lempuses (Premise 10), but there's no mention of Stella being loud or a lorpus, we can't use this chain to connect to vumpus.\n5. Stella being sweet (Premise 12) and a lempus (Premise 14) leads to Stella being a tumpus (Premise 6), which doesn't help directly in connecting to vumpus.\n6. Stella being red (Premise 15) and a tumpus (Premise 18) leads to Stella being a brimpus (Premise 8), which again doesn't help in connecting to vumpus.\n7.

To connect this to vumpus, we can use Premise 10:\n- \"Everything that is bright and a tumpus is a vumpus.\"\n\nSince Stella is bright (Premise 17) and a tumpus (Premise 19), it follows that Stella is a vumpus.\n\nNow we have:\n- Stella is temperate (Premise 18).\n- Stella is a vumpus (derived from Premises 10, 17, and 19).\n\nCombining these two facts, we have:\n- Stella is temperate and a vumpus.\n\nAccording to Premise 1, \"if Stella is temperate and a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary,\" we can conclude:\n- Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(1), (3), (10), (17), (18), (19) -> (21)"}]
