Since Fae is an impus (from premise 10), Fae could be a sterpus.\n\n3. Premise (8) states that every sterpus is fast, moderate, a lorpus, and a gorpus.

Combining the information from steps 2 and 4, if Fae is an impus (which it is) and can be a gorpus (due to its color description), then according to premise (2), Fae being an impus also means it can be a sterpus because impuses include sterpuses.\n\nTherefore, by linking the characteristics and definitions provided across the premises, we can conclude that Fae, being an impus and having colors that match those of a gorpus, fulfills the criteria to be classified as a sterpus based on the given definitions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(8),(6),(9),(10)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Fae is a sterpus then Taylor is a visionary.

Let's analyze the given information step by step:\n\n1. From premise (11), we know Fae is an impus. This is crucial because it links Fae to being potentially a sterpus through the definition of impuses in premise (3).\n\n2. Premise (3) states that impuses are small, large, jompuses, and sterpuses. Since Fae is an impus, Fae could be a sterpus based on this definition.\n\n3. To further support this, let's look at Fae's colors. Premise (10) describes Fae as red and brown. Premise (7) defines gorpuses as red, brown, wumpuses, and zumpuses. Since Fae matches these colors, Fae could be a gorpus.\n\n4. Premise (9) tells us that every sterpus is fast, moderate, a lorpus, and a gorpus. If Fae can be classified as a gorpus (based on color), then Fae also fulfills the criteria of being a sterpus according to this premise.\n\n5. Combining the information from steps 2 and 4, we have established that Fae being an impus and having colors consistent with a gorpus means Fae satisfies the conditions to be considered a sterpus.\n\n6. With Fae confirmed as a sterpus, we can now use premise (1) to conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, by linking the characteristics and definitions provided across the premises, we can deduce that Taylor is indeed a visionary.\n\nThe final answer is: (3),(10),(7),(9),(1)->(12)."}]
