Since Fae is a zumpus (from step 1), Fae could also be a dumpus. However, this information doesn't directly help us prove that Fae is a grimpus.\n\n3. **Using Premise (4)**: Every zumpus is a yumpus and a grimpus. Since Fae is a zumpus (from step 1), Fae must also be a yumpus and a grimpus. This already provides us with one part of our proof: Fae is a grimpus.\n\n4. **Additional Verification**: While we've already proven that Fae is a grimpus using premise (4), let's continue to explore other connections to ensure completeness.\n   - From (4): Fae is also a yumpus.\n   - Using (5): Every yumpus is a gorpus and an impus.

This doesn't directly connect to Fae.\n   - From (2): Each rompus is a lempus and a numpus. This doesn't directly connect to Fae.\n   - From (3): Each grimpus is a sterpus and a rompus. Since Fae is a grimpus, Fae is also a sterpus and a rompus.\n     - As a sterpus, Fae is a brimpus and a jompus (from (1)).\n     - As a rompus, Fae is a lempus and a numpus (from (2)).\n   - From (7): Numpuses are tumpuses and vumpuses. Since Fae is a numpus (from being a rompus), Fae is also a tumpus and a vumpus.\n   - From (8): Shumpuses are moderate and lorpuses.
