Let's analyze the given premises and the proof obligation step by step:\n\n### Premises Analysis:\n1. **Premise 1**: Everything that is a lorpus or a zumpus is a wumpus.\n   - This tells us about the properties of lorpus and zumpus in relation to being a wumpus.\n   \n2. **Premise 2**: Everything that is a sterpus or a shumpus is a brimpus.\n   - This premise talks about sterpus and shumpus in relation to being a brimpus. It does not directly relate to the proof obligation regarding Wren.\n   \n3. **Premise 3**: Everything that is a lorpus or a zumpus is a brimpus.\n   - This premise establishes that if something is a lorpus or a zumpus, it is also a brimpus.\n   \n4. **Premise 4**: Wren is not a brimpus.\n   - This premise provides information about Wren, specifically that Wren is not a brimpus.\n   \n5. **Premise 5**: Wren is not a vumpus.\n   - This premise provides additional information about Wren, but it doesn't seem directly relevant to proving whether Wren is a lorpus or a zumpus.\n\n### Proof Obligation:\n6. **Prove**: Wren is not a zumpus and Wren is not a lorpus.\n\n### Thought Process:\n- To prove that Wren is not a zumpus and not a lorpus, we need to show that neither condition (being a zumpus or being a lorpus) can be true for Wren.\n- From Premise 3, we know that if Wren were a lorpus or a zumpus, then Wren would be a brimpus.\n- However, Premise 4 states that Wren is not a brimpus.\n- Therefore, since being a lorpus or a zumpus implies being a brimpus, and Wren is not a brimpus, we can conclude that Wren cannot be a lorpus or a zumpus.\n\n### Derivation:\n- Combining Premise 3 and Premise 4, we can deduce that Wren is not a zumpus and Wren is not a lorpus because if Wren were either, then Wren would be a brimpus, which contradicts Premise 4.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises required to prove the proof obligation is Premise 3 and Premise 4.\n\n### Final Answer:\n(3),(4)->(6)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is not a zumpus and Wren is not a lorpus then Taylor is a visionary.
