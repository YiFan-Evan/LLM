This contradiction suggests that if Alex were a brimpus, there would be inconsistencies because:\n   - **Premise (5)** states that brimpuses are jompuses, numpuses, and zumpuses. Since Alex is not a numpus, Alex cannot be a brimpus if **Premise (5)** is true.\n   - **Premise (6)** states that every brimpus is a shumpus, which aligns with our earlier conclusion that Alex is a shumpus.
