Since Polly is an impus (from step 3), it follows that:\n   - Polly is a zumpus.\n\n6. From (7):\n   - Each zumpus is a rompus.\n\n7.

Since Polly is already established as a zumpus (from step 5), there is no need to consider Polly being a vumpus, jompus, or dumpus for her to be a zumpus. However, if we assume Polly were a vumpus, then she would be a zumpus by (3). But since being a rompus also makes her a zumpus (by (7) and (2)), this doesn't help us directly prove she isn't a vumpus.\n\n10. From (1):\n    - Everything that is a vumpus, a jompus, or a dumpus is a rompus.\n\n11. If we assume Polly were a vumpus, then by (1), she would be a rompus. But we already know from step 7 that Polly is a rompus. This assumption does not contradict any premises but also does not help us prove she isn't a vumpus.\n\n12. From (8):\n    - Lorpuses are not rompuses.\n\n13. Since Polly is a rompus (from step 7), she cannot be a lorpus by the contrapositive of (8).\n\n14. From (9):\n    - Each lorpus is a lempus.\n\n15. Since Polly is not a lorpus (from step 13) and each lorpus is a lempus (from step 14), this means being a lorpus is necessary for being a lempus. However, Polly is still a lempus by (10), so this doesn't contradict our findings.\n\n16. To prove Polly is not a vumpus, we need to find a contradiction or an impossibility in assuming Polly is a vumpus. We know from (1) and (3) that being a vumpus implies being a rompus, which Polly is. However, this fact alone doesn't disprove the possibility of Polly being a vumpus because all these conditions are consistent with each other.\n\n17. The key lies in understanding that while being a zumpus can come from being a vumpus, jompus, or dumpus (by (3)), Polly's identity as a zumpus is already established by her being an impus (by (2) and (6)). Thus, Polly's zumpus status doesn't necessitate her being a vumpus.\n\n18. Therefore, since being a zumpus can also come from being an impus (which Polly is), and there's no direct necessity for Polly to be a vumpus to fulfill any of the given premises, we conclude that Polly being a zumpus doesn't imply she must be a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(3),(5),(6),(7),(10),(11)->(12)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is not a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.

To prove Taylor is a visionary, we need to show that Polly is not a vumpus. We know from steps 1-8 that Polly being a zumpus and a rompus does not necessarily mean she cannot be a vumpus. However, we can use the information about Taylor being a visionary if Polly is not a vumpus.\n\n11. Since Polly is already a rompus (from step 8), and being a rompus does not exclude the possibility of being a vumpus, jompus, or dumpus (by (2) and (4)), we need to find a contradiction or an impossibility in assuming Polly is a vumpus.\n\n12. From (11), we know:\n   - Polly is a lempus, an impus, and a gorpus.\n\n13. From (10), we have:\n   - Each lorpus is a lempus.\n\n14. Since Polly is a lorpus (from step 1), it follows that:\n   - Polly is a lempus.\n\n15. Combining steps 12 and 14, we have two independent statements confirming Polly is a lempus.\n\n16. Now, considering Polly is a rompus (from step 8) and a lempus (from steps 12 and 14), and knowing that everything that is a vumpus, jompus, or a dumpus is a rompus (by (2) and (4)), but not necessarily the other way around, we cannot directly conclude that Polly is not a vumpus just because she is a rompus and a lempus.\n\n17. However, the key premise here is (1), which states \"if Polly is not a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.\" This implies that Taylor being a visionary is conditional on Polly not being a vumpus.\n\n18. Since we cannot find any direct contradiction in the premises that disproves Polly being a vumpus, and given the conditional nature of premise (1), we can only conclude that Taylor being a visionary depends on Polly not being a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1)->(13)."}]
