Since Max is a brimpus, it follows that Max is a zumpus.\n- Premise (13) tells us that Max is also a yumpus.\n- Premise (4) states that anything that is wooden or luminous or a sterpus is a yumpus. Since Max is a yumpus, this does not help us further determine if Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus.\n- Premise (10) states that anything that is nervous, shy, or a yumpus is a vumpus. Since Max is a yumpus, it follows that Max is a vumpus.\n- Premise (6) states that anything that is earthy or fruity or a vumpus is a numpus. Since Max is a vumpus, it follows that Max is a numpus.\n\nNow we have established that Max is a numpus. However, this doesn't directly prove that Max is earthy or fruity.
