The condition in premise (1) is:\n\n\"If Polly is not a brimpus and Polly is not a wumpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\"\n\nLet's break down the necessary steps to derive this conclusion:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**:\n   - Premise (3): Everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a yumpus.\n   - Premise (5): Polly is not a yumpus.\n   - Premise (6): Polly is not a shumpus.\n\n2. **Analyze the Relevance of Each Premise**:\n   - From premise (3), if something is a wumpus or a brimpus, it must be a yumpus.\n   - Premise (5) tells us that Polly is not a yumpus.\n   - Premise (6) tells us that Polly is not a shumpus, but this does not directly relate to whether Polly is a brimpus or wumpus.\n\n3. **Combine Premises to Derive Necessary Conclusions**:\n   - Since Polly is not a yumpus (premise 5) and everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a yumpus (premise 3), we can infer that Polly cannot be a wumpus or a brimpus. This is because if she were either, she would have to be a yumpus, which contradicts premise (5).\n\n4. **Apply the Derived Conclusion to Premise (1)**:\n   - We have established that Polly is not a brimpus and Polly is not a wumpus.\n   - According to premise (1), if Polly is not a brimpus and Polly is not a wumpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, by combining premises (3), (5), and applying them to premise (1), we can conclude that:\n\n(3), (5) -> (7)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n(3), (5) -> (7)."}]
