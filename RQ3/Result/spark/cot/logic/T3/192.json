Premise 17 indicates that every impus is a grimpus, but we don't have a direct connection between Rex and being an impus yet.\n6. Premise 8 states that each lorpus is an impus. Since Rex is a tumpus and tumpuses are brimpuses (from step 3), we need to find a link between brimpuses and lorpuses.\n7. Premise 4 connects tumpuses to lorpuses, stating that tumpuses are lorpuses.

The proof obligation is directly linked to Rex being sweet in premise (1), which then implies that Taylor is a visionary. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Rex's Attributes**: From premise (24) and (25), we know that Rex is both a jompus and a numpus.\n2. **Link Jompus to Sweet**: Premise (10) states that every lempus is a jompus, and premise (20) states that every jompus is luminous. However, these do not directly link to sweetness.\n3. **Link Numpus to Sweet**: Premise (2) indicates that numpuses are rompuses, but this does not help us prove that Rex is sweet.\n4. **Find a Direct Link to Sweet**: Premise (12) tells us that impuses are sweet. Since Rex is a numpus and a jompus, we need to find a way to connect these to being an impus.\n5. **Connect Jompus to Impus**: Premise (9) states that each lorpus is an impus. We already know from premise (23) that each jompus is a tumpus, and premise (5) states that tumpuses are lorpuses.\n6. **Combine the Connections**: Since Rex is a jompus, he is also a tumpus (premise 23) and thus a lorpus (premise 5). As a lorpus, Rex is also an impus (premise 9).\n7. **Conclude Rex is Sweet**: Since Rex is an impus, and all impuses are sweet (premise 12), it follows that Rex is sweet.\n8. **Relate to Taylor**: With Rex being sweet (from step 7), and premise (1) stating that if Rex is sweet then Taylor is a visionary, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (24),(25),(23),(5),(9),(12),(1)->(26)."}]
