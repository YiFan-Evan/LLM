Premise (5): Everything that is windy and snowy and sunny and rainy and a zumpus is a grimpus.\n   - Polly matches the description as being windy, snowy, sunny, rainy, and also a zumpus (from premises 12, 13, 15, 18, and 9). Therefore, we can conclude that Polly is a grimpus.\n\n2. Premise (3): Everything that is blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus is an impus.\n   - We already know from the above analysis that Polly is a grimpus. Now, let's check if Polly matches the other conditions in premise (3):\n     - Blue (Premise 16)\n     - Orange (Premise 20)\n     - Brown (Premise 14)\n     - Red (Premise 17)\n     - Grimpus (as derived from premise (5))\n   - All these conditions are met for Polly. Thus, Polly is an impus based on premise (3).\n\n3. Since we have established that Polly is an impus based on premise (3), we now need to see if there's any direct connection between being an impus and the conclusion that Polly is \"blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus.\" However, the premises given do not directly connect being an impus back to the specific color and attribute combination required.\n\nTherefore, using the provided premises and following the logical deduction process:\n- We first used premise (5) to establish that Polly is a grimpus.\n- Then, we used premise (3) to establish that Polly is an impus because she meets all the conditions listed in that premise.\n\nHowever, since premise (3) only helps us confirm that Polly is an impus and does not directly state that she is \"blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus,\" we cannot directly use these premises to prove the exact phrase required in (22). The closest we can get is establishing that Polly is an impus due to her meeting certain conditions including being a grimpus, which indirectly supports part of the proof obligation but not conclusively.\n\nTherefore, while we can deduce that Polly is an impus based on the given premises, we cannot directly prove the entire statement \"Polly is blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus\" solely from the listed premises without additional information or premises directly linking being an impus to having all those specific attributes together with being a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Based on the given premises, we can conclude that Polly is an impus due to meeting the conditions in premise (3), but we cannot directly prove that \"Polly is blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus\" as stated in proof obligation (22)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.

Premise (1): If Polly is blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n   - This premise directly states the condition under which Taylor would be a visionary. To prove Taylor is a visionary, we need to show that Polly meets all the conditions mentioned in this premise.\n\n2.
