Let's break down the relevant information:\n\n1. From (1), (3), (4), (5), (7), (8), and (10), we know that Grimpuses, Shumpuses, Jompuses, Dumpuses, Tumpuses, Brimpuses, and Lorpuses are all yumpuses.\n2. From (6) and (9), we know that every shumpus is a numpus, and lorpuses are numpuses.\n3. From (11) and (12), we know that Max is either a jompus, a tumpus, or a shumpus, or he is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus.\n\nLet's combine these pieces of information:\n\n- If Max is a jompus, then according to (4), he is a yumpus.\n- If Max is a tumpus, then according to (7), he is a yumpus.\n- If Max is a shumpus, then according to (3), he is a yumpus.\n- If Max is a lorpus, then according to (9), he is a numpus. However, being a numpus does not directly imply being a yumpus unless it can be established through another route. But since there's no direct link between numpuses and yumpuses except via specific categories like jompuses, tumpuses, or shumpuses, this path doesn't help us prove that Max is a yumpus unless he falls into one of those categories.\n\nGiven the options in (11) and (12), Max must be one of the following: jompus, tumpus, shumpus, lorpus. If he's a jompus, tumpus, or shumpus, he's directly a yumpus. If he's a lorpus, then he's a numpus, but without additional information linking numpuses to yumpuses outside of the already mentioned specific categories, we cannot conclude he's a yumpus solely based on being a lorpus.\n\nHowever, since the question specifically wants to prove Max is a yumpus, and given the premises, the most straightforward path is if Max falls into any of the first three categories listed (jompus, tumpus, shumpus), which would directly make him a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, combining the relevant premises that lead to Max being a yumpus, we have:\n\n(4), (7), (3) -> (13)\n\nThis means if Max is a jompus, tumpus, or shumpus, then he is a yumpus.
