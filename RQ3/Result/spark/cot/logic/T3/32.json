Here's how we can derive this conclusion:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**:\n   - (1) If Polly is shy then Taylor is a visionary.\n   - (24) Polly is a sterpus.\n   - (25) Polly is a rompus.\n\n2. **Establish Relationships**:\n   - From (24), we know that Polly is a sterpus.\n   - From (25), we know that Polly is a rompus.\n\n3. **Link Polly to Shyness**:\n   - Since Polly is both a sterpus and a rompus, we need to determine if being a sterpus or rompus implies shyness.\n   - From (12), every sterpus is not discordant. This does not directly relate to shyness but provides context about Polly's nature.\n   - From (17), each impus is not cold. Again, this doesn't directly relate to shyness but provides additional information.\n   - From (18), each gorpus is shy. However, we need to establish a connection between Polly and gorpus.\n\n4. **Trace Through Gorpus**:\n   - From (10), each rompus is a gorpus. Since Polly is a rompus (from (25)), Polly is also a gorpus.\n   - Now, using (18), since Polly is a gorpus, Polly is shy.\n\n5. **Apply the Implication**:\n   - We have established that Polly is shy.\n   - From (1), if Polly is shy then Taylor is a visionary.\n\n6. **Conclusion**:\n   - Therefore, Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThe minimal set of premises required to derive this conclusion are:\n(1), (10), (18), (24), (25) -> (26)."}]
