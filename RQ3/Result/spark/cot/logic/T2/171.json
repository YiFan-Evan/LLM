The following premises seem most relevant:\n   - (14) Yumpuses are not large.\n   - (19) Stella is a lempus.\n   - (20) Stella is a gorpus.\n\n3. **Logical Reasoning**:\n   - From (19), we know Stella is a lempus.\n   - From (3), we can infer that since Stella is a lempus, she must also be a wumpus.\n   - From (20), we know Stella is a gorpus.\n   - From (2), we know gorpuses are tumpuses, so Stella is also a tumpus.\n   - From (7), we know each tumpus is not loud, but this does not help with the size attribute.\n   - From (17), we know every gorpus is a lorpus, so Stella is also a lorpus.\n   - From (9), we know every lorpus is slow, but again, this does not help with the size attribute.\n   - From (14), we know yumpuses are not large. However, there is no direct link between being a yumpus and Stella.\n\n4. **Finding the Connection**:\n   To prove that Stella is not large, we need a link between Stella and the property of being a yumpus or any other entity that is not large. Unfortunately, none of the premises directly connect Stella to being a yumpus or having the property of being not large.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   Based on the given premises and logical reasoning, it seems that we cannot derive the conclusion that \"Stella is not large\" without additional information or assumptions. Therefore, the minimal set of premises that could potentially lead to the conclusion, based on the given information, would be:\n   - (14) Yumpuses are not large.\n   - (19) Stella is a lempus.\n   - (20) Stella is a gorpus.\n\nHowever, these alone do not provide a sufficient chain of logic to establish the proof obligation.
