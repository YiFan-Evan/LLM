Premise (24) states that Stella is a zumpus.\n7. From premise (15), we know that each zumpus is not transparent. So, Stella is not transparent.\n8. Premise (7) states that every zumpus is a numpus. Therefore, Stella is a numpus.\n9. Premise (14) tells us that each yumpus is fruity. Since Stella is a yumpus (from premise (20)), Stella is fruity.\n10.

Let's analyze the premises step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Stella is a gorpus (premise 2).\n\n2. **Gorpus to Vumpus**: Every gorpus is a vumpus (premise 3). Therefore, Stella is a vumpus.\n\n3. **Vumpus to Melodic**: Each vumpus is melodic (premise 9). Hence, Stella is melodic.\n\n4. **Gorpus to Grimpus**: Every gorpus is a grimpus (premise 8). So, Stella is also a grimpus.\n\n5. **Grimpus to Shumpus**: Grimpuses are shumpuses (premise 20). This means Stella is a shumpus.\n\n6. **Shumpus to Not Mean**: Every shumpus is not mean (premise 7). Therefore, Stella is not mean.\n\n7. **Grimpus to Sterpus**: Grimpuses are sterpuses (premise 24). Thus, Stella is a sterpus.\n\n8. **Sterpus to Dumpus**: Sterpuses are dumpuses (premise 21). So, Stella is a dumpus.\n\n9. **Dumpus to Not Happy**: Every dumpus is not happy (premise 6).
