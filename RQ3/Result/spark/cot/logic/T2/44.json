However, it contradicts **Premise (4)** and **Premise (7)** by stating that Alex is not a numpus, despite being a tumpus (which should imply Alex is a numpus according to **Premise (4)**). This contradiction suggests that if Alex were a brimpus, there would be inconsistencies because:\n   - **Premise (5)** states that brimpuses are jompuses, numpuses, and zumpuses. Since Alex is not a numpus, Alex cannot be a brimpus if **Premise (5)** is true.\n   - **Premise (6)** states that every brimpus is a shumpus. While this is consistent with Alex being a shumpus, it does not resolve the conflict with Alex not being a numpus as required by **Premise (5)** for a brimpus.\n\n3. **Premise (8)** tells us that each jompus is a grimpus, but since being a jompus is part of being a brimpus (**Premise (5)**), and Alex cannot be a jompus (and thus a grimpus) due to not being a numpus, this further supports that Alex cannot be a brimpus.\n\n4.

This is crucial because it sets the conditions for being a brimpus.\n\n2. **Premise (5)** tells us that brimpuses are jompuses and numpuses and zumpuses.
