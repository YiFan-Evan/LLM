Therefore, Fae is a yumpus.\n\nNow that we have established that Fae is a yumpus, we can use this in conjunction with Premise (6) to reach our goal:\n- According to Premise (6), everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus. Since Fae is a yumpus, Fae must also be a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, by combining the facts that Fae is a yumpus and using Premise (6), we can conclude that Fae is either luminous, metallic, or a yumpus.
