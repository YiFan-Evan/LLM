From premise 6, we know that every brimpus is a numpus. Therefore, Max is a numpus. From premise 17, we know that numpuses are dumpuses. Therefore, Max is a dumpus. From premise 24, we know that Max is a gorpus. From premise 5, we know that each gorpus is a tumpus. Therefore, Max is a tumpus. However, these facts alone do not directly lead us to the conclusion that Max is not moderate.\n\nNow, let's consider the wumpuses. From premise 20, we know that every wumpus is a lorpus. From premise 8, we know that every wumpus is not moderate. Therefore, if we can show that Max is a wumpus, then we can conclude that Max is not moderate.\n\nFrom premise 24, we know that Max is a gorpus. From premise 15, we know that gorpuses are happy. However, happiness does not directly relate to being a wumpus.\n\nFrom premise 23, we know that Max is a brimpus. From premise 11, we know that brimpuses are vumpuses. From premise 9, we know that vumpuses are temperate. However, temperateness does not directly relate to being a wumpus either.\n\nThe key lies in the fact that Max is both a brimpus and a gorpus, and we need to find a connection to wumpuses. From premise 22, we know that zumpuses are wumpuses. From premise 21, we know that zumpuses are shumpuses. From premise 19, we know that lempuses are zumpuses. From premise 12, we know that each numpus is a lempus. Since Max is a numpus (from being a brimpus), Max is a lempus. Since Max is a lempus, Max is a zumpus. Since Max is a zumpus, Max is a wumpus. And since every wumpus is not moderate (from premise 8), Max is not moderate.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions needed to derive the proof obligation is:\n- (6), (12), (19), (21), (22), (8)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $\\boxed{(6),(12),(19),(21),(22),(8)->(25)}$"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a gorpus.
