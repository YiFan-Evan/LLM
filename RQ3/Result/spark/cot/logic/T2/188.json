From premise 1, we know that everything that is a lorpus, gorpus, or grimpus is a wumpus, rompus, and zumpus. Since jompuses are grimpuses (premise 5), Rex, being a jompus, must also be a grimpus.\n\n3. Now, since Rex is a grimpus, we can apply premise 7, which states that everything that is a grimpus, sterpus, or lempus is a numpus. Therefore, Rex is a numpus.\n\n4. We already established that Rex is a shumpus (premise 9), and from premise 2, we know that everything that is a wumpus, shumpus, or sterpus is an impus. Therefore, Rex is an impus.\n\n5. Additionally, from premise 6, we know that jompuses are impuses. Since Rex is a jompus (premise 10), this reiterates that Rex is an impus.\n\n6.

To bridge the gap, we need to find a connection between being an impus and being a tumpus, dumpus, or wumpus.

Therefore, based on the provided premises, we cannot directly prove that Rex is a tumpus, dumpus, or wumpus.\n\n8.
