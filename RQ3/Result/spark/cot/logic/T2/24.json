From (17) we know that every vumpus is brown, but this information doesn't directly help us prove that Max is not large.\n3. From (23) we know that Max is a yumpus.\n4. From (1) we know that each yumpus is nervous, but again, this doesn't directly help us prove that Max is not large.\n5. From (21) we know that every yumpus is a jompus, so since Max is a yumpus, Max is also a jompus.\n6. From (7) we know that jompuses are hot, but this still doesn't help us with the size of Max.\n7. From (22) we know that every tumpus is a dumpus, and from (2) we know that every yumpus is a tumpus, so every yumpus is also a dumpus. Since Max is a yumpus (from (23)), Max is also a dumpus.\n8. From (10) we know that dumpuses are not transparent, but this doesn't help with the size either.\n9. From (15) we know that tumpuses are muffled, and since Max is a tumpus (from (23) and (2)), Max is also muffled.\n10. From (19) we know that each sterpus is not large, and from (9) we know that each rompus is a sterpus, so each rompus is not large.\n11. From (5) we know that each rompus is not fast, but this doesn't help with the size.\n12. From (8) we know that tumpuses are numpuses, and since Max is a tumpus (from (23) and (2)), Max is also a numpus.\n13. From (6) we know that numpuses are angry, but this doesn't help with the size.\n14. From (11) we know that numpuses are grimpuses, so since Max is a numpus (from (12)), Max is also a grimpus.\n15. From (13) we know that every grimpus is not dull, but this doesn't help with the size.\n16. From (18) we know that sterpuses are brimpuses, and from (20) we know that rompuses are zumpuses, so since rompuses are sterpuses (from (9)), rompuses are also brimpuses.\n17. From (12) we know that every brimpus is sweet, but this doesn't help with the size.\n18. Since Max is a yumpus (from (23)), and every yumpus is a jompus (from (21)), and every jompus is hot (from (7)), Max is hot. But this doesn't help with the size.\n\nNow, we need to connect the dots to prove that Max is not large. We already established that Max is a yumpus (from (23)), and from (2) we know that every yumpus is a tumpus, so Max is a tumpus. From (22) we know that every tumpus is a dumpus, so Max is a dumpus. From (19) we know that each sterpus is not large, and from (9) we know that each rompus is a sterpus, so each rompus is not large. From (20) we know that each rompus is a zumpus, so each zumpus is not large. Since Max is a dumpus (as established earlier), and from (22) we know that every tumpus is a dumpus, and from (2) we know that every yumpus is a tumpus, it follows that Max is not large.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(20),(22),(19),(9),(23)->(25)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a vumpus.
