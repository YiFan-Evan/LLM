Assume for contradiction that Wren is a zumpus. According to (1), being a zumpus implies being a wumpus. And according to (3), being a zumpus also implies being a brimpus. However, this contradicts (4), which states that Wren is not a brimpus. Therefore, our assumption that Wren is a zumpus must be false.\n\n2. Similarly, assume for contradiction that Wren is a lorpus. Following the same logic as above, being a lorpus would imply both being a wumpus and a brimpus, which again contradicts (4). Thus, our assumption that Wren is a lorpus must also be false.\n\nTherefore, by process of elimination and contradiction, we have proven that Wren cannot be either a zumpus or a lorpus. Hence, the proof obligation (6) holds true.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(4)->(6)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Wren is not a vumpus. (2) Wren is not a brimpus.
