Therefore, Polly is a tumpus.\n   - From premise (9), Each tumpus is transparent. Therefore, Polly is transparent.\n   - From premise (13), Tumpuses are yumpuses. Therefore, Polly is a yumpus.\n   - From premise (18), Each yumpus is not dull. Therefore, Polly is not dull.\n   - From premise (16), Gorpuses are not discordant. This doesn't directly relate to Polly but connects gorpuses to not being discordant.\n   - From premise (12), Numpuses are gorpuses. Therefore, numpuses are not discordant.\n   - From premise (1), Lorpuses are numpuses. Therefore, lorpuses are not discordant.\n   - From premise (10), Lorpuses are shumpuses. Therefore, shumpuses are not discordant.\n   - From premise (21), Shumpuses are not aggressive. Therefore, shumpuses are not aggressive.\n   - From premise (22), Brimpuses are not fruity. This doesn't directly relate to Polly but connects brimpuses to not being fruity.\n   - From premise (7), Brimpuses are lorpuses. Therefore, brimpuses are not fruity implies lorpuses are not fruity.\n   - From premise (2), Lorpuses are not luminous. This doesn't directly relate to Polly but connects lorpuses to not being luminous.\n   - From premise (19), Impuses are not feisty. This doesn't directly relate to Polly but connects impuses to not being feisty.\n   - From premise (20), Each impus is a rompus. Therefore, impuses are rompuses.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   The key connection here is through the relationship between grimpuses and being orange. Since Polly is connected to being a brimpus and brimpuses are not fruity, and from the chain of reasoning, we can deduce that Polly is not a grimpus, and since grimpuses are not orange, Polly is not orange.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (23),(24),(15),(9),(13),(18),(16),(12),(1),(10),(21),(22),(7),(2),(19),(20)->(25)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is a brimpus.
