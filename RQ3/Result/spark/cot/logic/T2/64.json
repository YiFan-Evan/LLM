Rex is transparent or a jompus.\n\nFirst, let's see if there's an immediate connection between Rex and being transparent or a jompus using the provided premises.\n\nStarting from premise (10) and (11):\n- Rex is a numpus.\n- Rex is a rompus.\n\nFrom premise (8), which talks about aggressive or a numpus being a brimpus, we don't have information about Rex being aggressive, so this doesn't help us directly prove (12).\n\nHowever, from premise (2), since Rex is a rompus, he must be a wumpus because everything that is small or a rompus is a wumpus.\n\nNow, let's try connecting this to the conclusion through other premises. We know from premise (9) that everything that is metallic or a tumpus is a yumpus, but we don't have information about Rex being metallic or a tumpus, so this doesn't help us either.\n\nNext, let's explore premise (5), which states that everything that is discordant or a tumpus is a zumpus. If we can somehow show that Rex is discordant or a tumpus, then Rex would be a zumpus. However, we have no direct information about Rex being discordant or a tumpus.\n\nPremise (6) mentions that everything that is floral or a zumpus is a dumpus, but again, we lack direct information linking Rex to being floral or a zumpus based on our current knowledge.\n\nPremise (7) discusses being slow or a jompus leading to being a lempus, but we have no information about Rex being slow or a jompus.\n\nPremise (4) states that everything that is spicy or a numpus is a jompus. Since Rex is a numpus, according to premise (10), it follows that Rex must also be a jompus. This directly connects Rex to being a jompus, fulfilling one part of the \"or\" condition in the conclusion we need to prove.\n\nSince we've established that Rex is a jompus, and according to premise (3), everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus, this further confirms our previous finding without adding new information relevant to proving the transparency part of the \"or\" condition in (12).\n\nTherefore, combining these findings:\n- Rex is a numpus (premise 10), making him a jompus (by premise 4).\n- Being a jompus directly relates to the conclusion we aim to prove, as per premise (3).\n\nThus, the minimal set of premise propositions needed to derive the conclusion is:\n(4),(10)->(12)\n\nThis sequence shows that Rex being a numpus leads to him being a jompus, and being a jompus satisfies the condition for being transparent or a jompus, thus proving the desired conclusion."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a rompus.
