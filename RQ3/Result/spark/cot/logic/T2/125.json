Everything that is a shumpus and a yumpus and a grimpus is a brimpus.\n\nWe need to prove:\n- (14) Rex is not a grimpus.\n\nLet's start by examining the premises related to Rex's properties:\n- From (1), (3), and (11), we know Rex is a yumpus and a shumpus.\n- From (2), (10), and (11), we know Rex is also a wumpus.\n- From (4), we know Rex is an impus and a tumpus but not a brimpus.\n- From (8), we know Rex is a lorpus.\n- From (9), we know impuses are wumpuses, which we already knew from (2) and (10).\n\nNow, let's look at the implications:\n- From (6), lorpuses are brimpuses. Since Rex is a lorpus (from (8)), it would imply that Rex is a brimpus if he were not already established as not being one (from (4)).\n- From (5), everything that is a lorpus, a shumpus, and a wumpus is a dumpus. Since Rex is all these things, Rex is a dumpus.\n- From (7), everything that is a shumpus, a yumpus, and a grimpus is a gorpus. Since Rex is a shumpus and a yumpus (from (1) and (3)), for Rex not to be a grimpus, he cannot fulfill the condition of being a gorpus (which he is, from (2)). Thus, Rex cannot be a grimpus.\n- From (13), everything that is a shumpus and a yumpus and a grimpus is a brimpus. Since Rex is not a brimpus (from (4)), he cannot be all three: a shumpus, a yumpus, and a grimpus simultaneously.\n\nCombining these insights, we can deduce:\n- Rex being a lorpus implies he should be a brimpus (from (6)), but he isn't (from (4)).\n- Rex being a lorpus, shumpus, and wumpus implies he is a dumpus (from (5)).\n- Rex being a shumpus and yumpus implies he cannot be a grimpus without also being a brimpus (from (13) and contradicting (4)).\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises that allows us to derive the proof obligation that Rex is not a grimpus is:\n(4), (6), (13) -> (14)\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n(4),(6),(13)->(14)"}]
