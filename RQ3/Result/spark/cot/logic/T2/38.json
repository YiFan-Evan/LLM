Let's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. We know from premise (19) that Stella is angry.\n2. From premise (11), if something is angry and a lempus, then it is a yumpus. Since Stella is angry and a lempus (from premise (14)), we can conclude that Stella is a yumpus.\n3. Premise (10) states that everything that is loud and a lorpus is a lempus. However, there is no information about Stella being loud or a lorpus, so this premise does not help us directly.\n4. Premise (15) tells us that Stella is red.\n5. Premise (8) states that everything that is red and a tumpus is a brimpus. Since Stella is red (from premise (15)) and a tumpus (from premise (18)), we can conclude that Stella is a brimpus.\n6. Premise (16) states that Stella is bright.\n7. Premise (9) states that everything that is bright and a tumpus is a vumpus. Since Stella is bright (from premise (16)) and a tumpus (from premise (18)), we can conclude that Stella is a vumpus.\n8.
