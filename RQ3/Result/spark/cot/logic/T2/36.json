We'll start by identifying which premises directly or indirectly relate to Wren and then build from there.\n\n1. Premises (14) and (15) tell us that Wren is either a zumpus, a rompus, a brimpus, or a dumpus.\n2. From premise (7), we know every dumpus is a shumpus.\n3.

Premise (11) tells us each zumpus is a vumpus.\n\nNow, let's connect these:\n- If Wren is a dumpus (from premise 14 or 15), then by premise (7), Wren is a shumpus.\n- If Wren is a brimpus (from premise 14 or 15), then by premise (6), Wren is a vumpus.\n- If Wren is a rompus (from premise 14 or 15), then by premise (9), Wren is a shumpus.\n- If Wren is a zumpus (from premise 14 or 15), then by premise (11), Wren is a vumpus.\n\nSince being a shumpus doesn't directly lead to being a vumpus (based on the given premises), we focus on the direct connections:\n- Being a zumpus leads directly to being a vumpus (premise 11).\n- Being a brimpus leads directly to being a vumpus (premise 6).\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether Wren is specifically identified as a zumpus, brimpus, dumpus, rompus, or any other type of pus not directly leading to vumpus, the fact that Wren can be one of those types that does lead directly to vumpus (zumpus or brimpus) is sufficient to conclude that Wren is a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (14),(15),(6),(11)->(16)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Wren is a sterpus or a zumpus or a rompus or a brimpus.
