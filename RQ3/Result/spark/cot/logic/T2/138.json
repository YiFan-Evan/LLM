However, this doesn't directly help us prove that Sam is snowy or a brimpus; it only confirms that if Sam were either of those, he would be a numpus.\n\nBut here's the key point: We don't need to prove that Sam is snowy or a brimpus based on whether he's a numpus or not. We already know from premise (1) that Sam is a brimpus because he's a lempus. Therefore, by the definition in premise (4), being a brimpus is sufficient to satisfy the condition \"Sam is snowy or a brimpus.\"\n\nTherefore, since Sam is already proven to be a brimpus, he fulfills the condition of being \"snowy or a brimpus.\"\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive the proof obligation is premise (1) and premise (6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(6)->(8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sam is a lorpus.
