But this doesn't directly help us with proving Wren is a shumpus.\n\nHowever, from (3), since Wren is a brimpus (from being a shumpus as per our assumption), we can deduce:\n- Wren is a wumpus.\n- Wren is a zumpus.\n\nFrom (10), we already know:\n- Wren is a zumpus.\n- Wren is a wumpus.\n\nSo, all the information we have derived so far aligns with the given facts, but we still need to establish Wren as a shumpus directly.\n\nFrom (8), we know that every shumpus is a jompus and a brimpus. This means if someone is a shumpus, they must also be a brimpus. Since we have established that Wren is a brimpus from being a shumpus (our assumption), this forms a circular logic where we assumed Wren is a shumpus to prove Wren is a shumpus.\n\nTherefore, to break this circular logic and find the minimal set of premises that directly lead to the conclusion without assuming what we are trying to prove, we need to reconsider our approach.\n\nLooking back at the premises, the most direct connection to proving Wren as a shumpus comes from the fact that Wren is a gorpus (from being a vumpus), and gorpuses are shumpuses (from premise 6). Thus, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Wren is a shumpus is:\n\n(7) Each vumpus is a sterpus and a gorpus.\n(6) Gorpuses are shumpuses and lorpuses.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (7),(6)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Wren is a zumpus and a wumpus.
