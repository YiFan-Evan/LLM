From proposition 15, since Max is a brimpus, he is also a tumpus (because every brimpus is a tumpus).\n3. From proposition 1, since Max is a tumpus, he is also a lorpus (because every tumpus is a lorpus).\n4. From proposition 17, since Max is a lorpus, he is also a numpus (because every lorpus is a numpus).\n5. From proposition 22, since Max is a lorpus, he is not cold (because every lorpus is not cold).\n\nThus, by following these steps, we have proven that Max is not cold based on the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (23),(15),(1),(17),(22)->(25)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a jompus.

Let's identify the relevant propositions and construct a logical sequence:\n\n1. From proposition 24, we know that every tumpus is a lorpus.\n2. From proposition 10, we know that each brimpus is a tumpus.\n3. Combining 1 and 2, since Max is a brimpus (proposition 2), he is also a tumpus, and thus he is a lorpus.\n4. From proposition 21, we know that every jompus is a sterpus.\n5. Since Max is a jompus (proposition 1), he is also a sterpus.\n6. From proposition 8, we know that every impus is a brimpus.\n7. From proposition 4, we know that each impus is a rompus.\n8. Combining 6 and 7, every rompus is a brimpus.\n9. From proposition 17, we know that every impus is a brimpus.\n10.
