This is consistent with premise 20, which states that Rex is a lorpus.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of Rex being a lorpus, vumpus, and dumpus:\n- From premise 12, if something is a lorpus, vumpus, and dumpus, it is a tumpus. Since Rex is all three, he must be a tumpus.\n\nNext, let's look at the implications of Rex being a sterpus:\n- From premise 17, since Rex is a sterpus, he must be an impus.\n\nNow, let's consider the implications of Rex being an impus:\n- From premise 8, shumpuses are not impuses. This means if Rex were a shumpus, he couldn't be an impus, but since he is an impus, he can't be a shumpus.\n\nLet's now consider the implications of Rex being a vumpus, numpus, and yumpus:\n- From premise 15, since Rex is a vumpus, numpus, and yumpus, he must be a shumpus.\n\nSince Rex is a shumpus, and shumpuses are not impuses (premise 8), there is a contradiction because Rex is also an impus (from being a sterpus). This contradiction implies that our initial assumption that Rex is a lempus must be false, because if Rex were a lempus, he would be a dumpus (from premise 5), and then he would be a wumpus (from premise 10), and then he would be a lempus, a gorpus, and an impus (from premise 19), which would make him an impus, leading to the contradiction with him being a shumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (8), (9), (10), (12), (13), (14), (15), (17), (19), (20) -> (21)"}]
