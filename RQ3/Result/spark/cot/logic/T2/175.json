Therefore, Sally is also an impus.\nFrom premise 19, every impus is a zumpus. Therefore, Sally is also a zumpus.\nFrom premise 22, each jompus is a tumpus. From premise 23, zumpuses are jompuses. Combining these, we know that each zumpus is a tumpus.\nFrom premise 18, zumpuses are dumpuses. Therefore, each tumpus is also a dumpus.\nFrom premise 7, each jompus is not small. Since each jompus is a tumpus (from premise 22), and each tumpus is a dumpus (from premise 18), it follows that each dumpus is not small.\nSince Sally is a shumpus (premise 1) and shumpuses are wumpuses (premise 20), Sally is also a wumpus.\nFrom premise 17, each wumpus is not loud. This does not directly relate to the size of Sally but establishes another property of Sally as a wumpus.\nFrom premise 16, each lorpus is kind. Since each jompus is a lorpus (premise 11), and each jompus is a tumpus (premise 22), it follows that each tumpus (and thus each dumpus) is kind. However, this does not help in proving that Sally is not small.\n\nCombining all the relevant information, Sally being a shumpus implies she is an impus, and being an impus implies she is a zumpus. Since each jompus is a tumpus and each tumpus is a dumpus, and each jompus is not small, it follows that Sally, being a dumpus, is not small.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(7),(18),(19),(22),(23),(24)->(25)."}]
