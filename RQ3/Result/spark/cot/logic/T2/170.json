Premise (10) tells us that Polly is a lempus.\n2. Premise (11) tells us that Polly is a tumpus.\n3. Premise (6) states that anything that is a lempus, an impus, or a rompus is a sterpus.\n4. Premise (2) states that every tumpus is a numpus, a vumpus, and an impus.\n5. Premise (7) states that every numpus is a sterpus.\n6. Premise (9) states that each impus is a brimpus.\n\nNow, let's see if we can derive the proof obligation using these premises:\n\nFrom (11), we know Polly is a tumpus. According to (2), since Polly is a tumpus, she must also be a vumpus and an impus. This immediately gives us two of the three possibilities needed for the proof obligation: Polly is a vumpus and an impus.\n\nHowever, to satisfy the proof obligation fully, we would need to show that Polly is either a shumpus, a vumpus, or an impus. Since we have already established that Polly is a vumpus and an impus, we only need to consider the possibility of Polly being a shumpus.\n\nPremises (1), (3), (4), (5), (8), and (9) do not contribute directly to proving that Polly is a shumpus or adding any new information about Polly's status as a vumpus or an impus. Therefore, they are not necessary for deriving the proof obligation.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises that allows us to prove the proof obligation is:\n\n(2),(11)->(12)\n\nThis is because (2) provides the necessary information that as a tumpus, Polly is also a vumpus and an impus, and (11) identifies Polly as a tumpus, which in turn leads to the conclusion that Polly is a vumpus and an impus, satisfying the proof obligation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n(2),(11)->(12)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is a tumpus.

Let's analyze the premises and see how they can be used to derive the proof obligation.\n\n**Premises Analysis:**\n\n1. **Premise (1)**: Polly is a tumpus.\n2. **Premise (2)**: Polly is a lempus.\n3. **Premise (3)**: Each impus is a brimpus.\n4. **Premise (4)**: Wumpuses are dumpuses.\n5. **Premise (5)**: Every numpus is a sterpus.\n6. **Premise (6)**: Everything that is a lempus, an impus, or a rompus is a sterpus.\n7. **Premise (7)**: Every vumpus is a dumpus.\n8. **Premise (8)**: Tumpuses are dumpuses.\n9. **Premise (9)**: Vumpuses are wumpuses and jompuses and impuses.\n10. **Premise (10)**: Every tumpus is a numpus, a vumpus, and an impus.\n11. **Premise (11)**: Every jompus is a gorpus.\n\n**Proof Process:**\n\nFrom **Premise (1)** and **Premise (10)**, we can deduce:\n- Polly is a tumpus, therefore Polly is a numpus, a vumpus, and an impus.\n\nFrom **Premise (2)** and **Premise (6)**, we can deduce:\n- Polly is a lempus, therefore Polly is a sterpus.\n\nNow, combining these deductions:\n- Polly is a numpus, a vumpus, and an impus (from being a tumpus).\n- Polly is a sterpus (from being a lempus).\n\nSince we already know Polly is a vumpus and an impus from the deduction above, we have directly satisfied two of the three conditions in the proof obligation. The remaining condition to check is whether Polly can be a shumpus. However, none of the premises mention anything about shumpuses directly related to Polly or any other entities.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot directly prove that Polly is a shumpus. But we have proven that Polly is at least a vumpus and an impus.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe minimal set of premises that allows us to prove that Polly is a vumpus or an impus is:\n- Premise (1), (2), (10) -> (12)\n\nHowever, without additional information or premises specifically linking Polly to being a shumpus, we cannot complete the proof for all three possibilities (shumpus, vumpus, impus) stated in the proof obligation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(1),(2),(10)->(12)"}]
