Let's analyze each premise and see how they relate to proving that \"Max is not an impus.\"\n\nFirst, let's list out the premises:\n1. Each lempus is not a yumpus.\n2. Max is a jompus.\n3. Everything that is a zumpus and a wumpus and a gorpus is a vumpus.\n4. Max is a zumpus.\n5. Each shumpus is a sterpus.\n6. Each lempus is a gorpus.\n7. Max is a gorpus.\n8.

Max is a tumpus.\n\nProof obligation:\n17. Max is not an impus.\n\nNow, let's analyze the premises:\n\nFrom (2), (9), and (1):\n- Max is a jompus.\n- Jompuses are yumpuses.\n- Each lempus is not a yumpus.\n\nSince Max is a jompus and jompuses are yumpuses, it follows that Max is a yumpus. Since each lempus is not a yumpus, it implies that Max is not a lempus.\n\nFrom (4), (11), (7), and (3):\n- Max is a zumpus.\n- Max is a wumpus.\n- Max is a gorpus.\n- Everything that is a zumpus, a wumpus, and a gorpus is a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, Max is a vumpus.\n\nFrom (14) and (10):\n- Max is a shumpus, a lempus, and a numpus.\n- Numpuses are vumpuses.\n\nSince Max is a numpus, it follows that Max is also a vumpus.\n\nFrom (15), (16), and (8):\n- Max is a zumpus.\n- Max is a tumpus.\n- Everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a grimpus.\n\nWe cannot directly use these premises to conclude anything about whether Max is or is not an impus because the conjunction with being an impus is missing in the information given about Max.\n\nFrom (12):\n- Everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a yumpus.\n\nAgain, we cannot use this to directly conclude anything about whether Max is or is not an impus because the conjunction with being an impus is missing in the information given about Max.\n\nFrom (13):\n- Max is a vumpus and a dumpus and a jompus.\n\nThis does not provide any new information about whether Max is or is not an impus.\n\nFrom (14):\n- Max is a shumpus, a lempus, and a numpus.\n\nWe already know from earlier analysis that Max is a vumpus because he is a numpus.\n\nFrom (6) and (14):\n- Each lempus is a gorpus.\n- Max is a lempus.\n\nSince Max is a lempus, it follows that Max is also a gorpus. This was already established earlier.\n\nNow, combining all the relevant information we have:\n- Max is a jompus, which means he is a yumpus.\n- Max is a numpus, which means he is a vumpus.\n- Max is a lempus, which means he is a gorpus.\n- Max is a zumpus, a wumpus, and a gorpus, which means he is a vumpus.\n- Max is a shumpus, which means he is a sterpus (though this does not help with proving he is not an impus)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a tumpus.

If Max were an impus, then according to Premise 5:\n- **Everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a yumpus.**\n\nSince Max is already a zumpus (Premise 2) and a tumpus (Premise 1), and we are assuming Max is an impus, it would follow that:\n- **Max is a yumpus.**\n\nHowever, this contradicts our earlier conclusion that Max is not a yumpus. Therefore, the assumption that Max is an impus leads to a contradiction.
