From Premise 14 and Premise 15, we know that Wren is either a dumpus, a tumpus, a numpus, or a brimpus.\n2. If Wren is a dumpus, then from Premise 8, Wren is an impus.\n3. If Wren is a tumpus, then from Premise 11, Wren is an impus.\n4. If Wren is a numpus, then from Premise 6, Wren is an impus.\n5. If Wren is a brimpus, then from Premise 5, Wren is an impus.\n\nTherefore, regardless of whether Wren is a dumpus, tumpus, numpus, or brimpus, Wren is an impus.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises that allows us to prove that \"Wren is an impus\" is:\n\n(5),(8),(11),(6),(14),(15)->(16)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n(5),(8),(11),(6),(14),(15)->(16)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Wren is a dumpus or a tumpus or a numpus or a brimpus.

Since being a sterpus does not directly imply being an impus based on the given premises, we need to check if there's any other connection. However, Premise 4 does not provide a direct link to impus for yumpus.\n\nGiven these possibilities, we can see that in every case where Wren could be one of the specified types (dumpus, tumpus, numpus, brimpus), Wren is an impus. Therefore, the minimal set of premises required to prove that \"Wren is an impus\" would be:\n\n(1),(2),(5),(8),(10),(11)->(16)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n(1),(2),(5),(8),(10),(11)->(16)."}]
