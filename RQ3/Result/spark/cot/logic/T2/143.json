Start with the given properties of Sally:\n   - Sally is fruity (Premise 1).\n   - Sally is red (Premise 2).\n   - Sally is a jompus (Premise 3).\n   - Sally is kind (Premise 4).\n   - Sally is a numpus (Premise 5).\n   - Sally is wooden (Premise 6).\n   - Sally is a lempus (Premise 7).\n   - Sally is opaque (Premise 8).\n\n2. Use these properties to derive additional information:\n   - From Premises 1 and 3, we know that Sally is both fruity and a jompus. Using Premise 11: \"Everything that is fruity and a jompus is a tumpus,\" we can infer that Sally is a tumpus.\n   - From Premises 4 and 3, we know that Sally is both kind and a jompus. Using Premise 14: \"Everything that is kind and a jompus is a numpus,\" we can infer that Sally is a numpus.\n   - From Premises 5, 6, and 12: \"Everything that is wooden and a numpus is a rompus,\" we can infer that Sally is a rompus.\n\n3.
