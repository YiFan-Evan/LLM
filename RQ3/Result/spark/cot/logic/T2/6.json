(Premise 23)\n24. Fae is a brimpus. (Premise 24)\n\nFrom Premise 23 and Premise 1, we know that if Fae is a sterpus and every sterpus is a tumpus (from Premise 12), then Fae is also a tumpus. Since every sterpus is not luminous (Premise 21), Fae is not luminous as well. But this does not help us directly with proving that Fae is not large.\n\nNext, from Premise 24 and Premise 19, we know that Fae, being a brimpus, is also a zumpus. However, this also does not help us prove that Fae is not large directly.\n\nNow, combining Premises 10 and 4, we get that vumpuses are jompuses and jompuses are gorpuses, which means vumpuses are also gorpuses. Combining this with Premise 7, we get that every gorpus is a dumpus, so vumpuses are dumpuses as well.\n\nCombining Premises 2 and 8, we get that yumpuses are impuses. Combining this with Premise 6, we get that impuses are not aggressive, so neither are yumpuses.\n\nHowever, none of these combinations directly help us prove that Fae is not large.\n\nBut we notice that Premise 1 states that every jompus is not large. If we can prove that Fae is a jompus, then we can directly conclude that Fae is not large.\n\nFrom Premise 20, we know that every jompus is a lorpus. Combining this with Premise 4, we get that jompuses are gorpuses, so every jompus is a lorpus and a gorpus.
