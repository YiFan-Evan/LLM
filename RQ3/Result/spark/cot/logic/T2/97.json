Let's analyze the premises step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the starting point**: We start with what we know about Fae from the premises. Premise (9) states \"Fae is a tumpus and a wumpus.\" This gives us two categories Fae belongs to.\n\n2. **Expanding categories**: Next, we look for any premises that involve tumpuses or wumpuses to expand our understanding of what these categories entail. From premise (6), we know \"Zumpuses are wumpuses and tumpuses.\" Since Fae is a wumpus and a tumpus, Fae must also be a zumpus.\n\n3. **Connecting more categories**: Now that we know Fae is a zumpus, we can use this information to connect more categories. Premise (8) states \"Every yumpus is a dumpus and a gorpus.\" Although this does not directly mention zumpuses, it provides a connection between yumpus and gorpus, which will become relevant later.\n\n4. **Exploring rompuses**: Premise (7) states \"Every rompus is a yumpus and a brimpus.\" Since Fae is identified as a rompus in premise (10), this directly implies that Fae is also a yumpus.\n\n5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, based on the chain of reasoning from premises (9), (6), and (7), we can deduce that Fae is a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (9),(6),(7)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is a brimpus and a rompus.
