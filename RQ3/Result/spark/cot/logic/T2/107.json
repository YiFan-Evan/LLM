Premise (9): Everything that is dull and a shumpus is a brimpus.\n2. Premise (16): Sam is dull.\n\nFrom these two premises, we can deduce that if Sam is dull and a shumpus, then Sam is a brimpus. However, we don't yet know if Sam is a shumpus. We need to find additional premises that can help us establish this connection.\n\n3.

Premise (15): Sam is a tumpus.\n\nFrom these premises, we can deduce that if Sam is snowy and a tumpus, then Sam is a shumpus. Since we already know from premises (13) and (15) that Sam is snowy and a tumpus, it follows that Sam is a shumpus.\n\nNow, combining this with the fact that Sam is dull (premise 16), we can use premise (9) to conclude that Sam is a brimpus. However, our goal is to prove that Sam is dull and a shumpus, not just that Sam is a brimpus.\n\nSince we have established that Sam is a shumpus, and we already knew that Sam is dull, we can now directly state that Sam is dull and a shumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (9),(16),(4),(7),(13),(15)->(17)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sam is dull.
