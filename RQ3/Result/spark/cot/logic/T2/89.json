Use the information about impuses and gorpus from (3) and (1):\n   - Each impus is a wumpus and a gorpus. Since Max is a gorpus, he could be an impus.\n\n3. Use the information about dumpuses from (4):\n   - Dumpuses are spicy and impuses. If Max is an impus, then he could also be a dumpus.\n\n4. Use the information about tumpus from (5):\n   - Each tumpus is hot and a sterpus and a brimpus. We need to find a connection between being a dumpus and a tumpus.\n\n5.
