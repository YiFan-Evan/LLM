(1) Everything that is a brimpus or a lempus or a rompus is a zumpus and a tumpus and a vumpus.\n   - This tells us that if something is a brimpus, lempus, or rompus, it has three additional properties: zumpus, tumpus, and vumpus.\n\n2. (2) Everything that is a rompus, a dumpus, or a lorpus is a jompus.\n   - This tells us about rompus, dumpus, and lorpus being related to jompus, but does not directly help with proving Polly is a tumpus.\n\n3. (3) Everything that is a brimpus or a lempus or a rompus is a sterpus.\n   - This adds another property (sterpus) to brimpus, lempus, and rompus.\n\n4. (4) Everything that is an impus or a dumpus or a yumpus is a numpus.\n   - This connects impus, dumpus, and yumpus to numpus. Since Polly is a dumpus (from premise 10), Polly is also a numpus.\n\n5. (5) Everything that is a lempus, a grimpus, or a numpus is a shumpus.\n   - This tells us that if something is a lempus, grimpus, or numpus, it is also a shumpus. We know from premise 4 that Polly is a numpus, so Polly is also a shumpus.\n\n6. (6) Everything that is a rompus, a dumpus, or a lorpus is a lempus.\n   - This tells us that rompus, dumpus, and lorpus are all lempuses. Since Polly is a dumpus (from premise 10), Polly is also a lempus.\n\n7. (7) Zumpuses are grimpuses.\n   - This tells us that zumpuses are grimpuses. However, we don't have information about Polly being a zumpus yet.\n\n8. (8) Every vumpus is a yumpus.\n   - This tells us that vumpuses are yumpuses. We know from premise 1 that rompus (and thus Polly as a lempus via premise 6) is a vumpus, so Polly is also a yumpus.\n\n9. (9) Polly is a yumpus.\n   - This reiterates that Polly is a yumpus, which we already established in step 8.\n\n10. (10) Polly is a dumpus.\n    - This reiterates that Polly is a dumpus, which we already established in step 4.\n\nNow, let's combine these steps to derive the conclusion:\n\nFrom premise 6, Polly is a dumpus, so Polly is a lempus.\nFrom premise 1, since Polly is a lempus, Polly is also a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(6)->(11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is a dumpus.
