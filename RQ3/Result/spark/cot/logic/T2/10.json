From premise (4), we know that Polly is not a yumpus. This means that Polly cannot be a grimpus or a tumpus, because according to premise (1), everything that is a grimpus or a tumpus is a yumpus. Therefore, Polly is neither a grimpus nor a tumpus.\n\n2. Now, let's consider premise (2). It states that everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a yumpus. Since Polly is not a yumpus (from premise (4)), it follows that Polly cannot be a wumpus or a brimpus, because if she were either, she would be a yumpus, which contradicts premise (4).\n\n3. Therefore, we have established that Polly is not a wumpus and not a brimpus based on the fact that she is not a yumpus and the relationship between being a wumpus/brimpus and being a yumpus as stated in premise (2).\n\n4. Premise (5) states that Polly is not a shumpus, but this information is not directly relevant to proving that Polly is not a brimpus or a wumpus since there is no premise stating that being a shumpus implies being a wumpus or a brimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(1), (2), (4) -> (6)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is not a shumpus.

Polly is not a brimpus and Polly is not a wumpus.\n\nLet's start by considering the implications of premises (3) and (4):\n\n- According to premise (4), if Polly were a brimpus or a wumpus, then Polly would be a yumpus. However, premise (2) states that Polly is not a yumpus. Therefore, Polly cannot be a brimpus or a wumpus because being either would contradict the fact that Polly is not a yumpus.\n\nNow, let's formalize this reasoning:\n\n- If Polly were a brimpus, then by premise (4), Polly would be a yumpus. But this contradicts premise (2), which states that Polly is not a yumpus. Therefore, Polly cannot be a brimpus.\n- Similarly, if Polly were a wumpus, then by premise (4), Polly would also be a yumpus. Again, this contradicts premise (2). Therefore, Polly cannot be a wumpus.\n\nSince both possibilities lead to contradictions, we can conclude that Polly is neither a brimpus nor a wumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(2), (4) -> (6)"}]
