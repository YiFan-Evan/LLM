The premises do not provide any specific information about Max's status as a numpus other than the implications related to being a brimpus and grimpus.

From premise (1), (2), (3), and (4), we know that Max is a yumpus, tumpus, and lorpus.\n2. From premise (5), we know that \"Everything that is a yumpus and a tumpus and a lorpus is not a grimpus.\" Since Max is all three, Max is not a grimpus.\n3. From premise (9), we know that \"Every wumpus is a grimpus.\"\n4. From premise (13), we know that Max is a wumpus.\n5. Combining premises (3) and (13), since every wumpus is a grimpus and Max is a wumpus, Max must be a grimpus.\n6. However, from premise (5), we already established that Max cannot be a grimpus because he is a yumpus, tumpus, and lorpus.\n\nThis creates a contradiction because Max cannot simultaneously be and not be a grimpus. To resolve this contradiction, we must re-examine the premises to see if there's any information that can help us determine whether Max can be a numpus without causing a contradiction.\n\nLet's look at the remaining premises:\n\n- Premise (6) states that \"Everything that is a yumpus, an impus, and a lempus is a vumpus.\" Since Max is a yumpus, impus, and lempus (from premises (4), (10), and (7)), Max is a vumpus.\n- Premise (8) states that \"Everything that is a dumpus, a numpus, or a vumpus is a rompus.\" Since Max is a vumpus, Max is also a rompus.\n- Premise (11) states that \"Everything that is a sterpus, a numpus, or a shumpus is a brimpus.\" This does not directly affect our proof regarding Max being a numpus.\n- Premise (12) states that \"Everything that is a sterpus, a numpus, or a shumpus is a grimpus.\" This also does not directly affect our proof.\n\nSince being a numpus would make Max a brimpus and a grimpus according to premises (11) and (12), but we have already established that Max cannot be a grimpus (due to being a yumpus, tumpus, and lorpus), Max cannot be a numpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(5), (9), (13) -> (16)\n\nThis conclusion is reached by recognizing the contradiction created by Max being both a wumpus (and thus a grimpus) and not being able to be a grimpus due to being a yumpus, tumpus, and lorpus."}]
