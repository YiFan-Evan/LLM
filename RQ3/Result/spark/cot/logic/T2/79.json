Let's break down the premises and see how they can be connected:\n\n1. **Fae is a tumpus and a grimpus.** (Premise 1)\n2. **Each grimpus is a tumpus and a shumpus.** (Premise 7)\n3. **Every vumpus is sunny and a sterpus.** (Premise 9)\n4. **Lempuses are numpuses and impuses.** (Premise 5)\n5. **Shumpuses are gorpuses and lempuses.** (Premise 6)\n6. **Each tumpus is a zumpus and a jompus.** (Premise 8)\n7. **Every brimpus is a rompus and a lorpus.** (Premise 3)\n8. **Every wumpus is a brimpus and a grimpus.** (Premise 4)\n9. **Fae is an impus and a numpus.** (Premise 2)\n\nFrom Premise 1, we know that Fae is a tumpus and a grimpus. This directly connects Fae to the properties of being a tumpus and a grimpus.\n\nNext, from Premise 7, we know that each grimpus is a tumpus and a shumpus. Since Fae is a grimpus (from Premise 1), it follows that Fae must also be a shumpus.\n\nThus, the chain of reasoning is as follows:\n- Fae is a grimpus (from Premise 1).\n- Every grimpus is a shumpus (from Premise 7).\n- Therefore, Fae is a shumpus.\n\nThis chain of reasoning directly links Fae to being a shumpus without needing any additional premises.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `(1),(7)->(10)`."}]
