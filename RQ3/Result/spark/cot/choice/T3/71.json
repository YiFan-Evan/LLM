The correct answer is B. uninhabitable.\n\nExplanation: While the words \"circulating_blood\" and \"death\" are associated with toxicity, and \"suitless\" and \"prison_room\" imply an unfit environment, they do not directly relate to the specific reasons why Mercury is unsuitable for human life. Mercury is considered uninhabitable due to its extreme temperatures and lack of a breathable atmosphere, which are the primary reasons it is unsuitable for human life.
