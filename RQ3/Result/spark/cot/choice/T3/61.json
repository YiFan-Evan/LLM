(Since the top reason-words generated by the model include \"sports_complex\" and \"pitchfork,\" it suggests that the model is associating baseball with a sports facility or complex, and implying that the newest stadium is likely to be located in an urban area that accommodates such facilities. Moreover, the presence of \"bronx_new_york\" in the reason-words may be indicating that the model has detected a correlation between recent baseball stadium developments and New York City.
