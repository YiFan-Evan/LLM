Punctured - This would be true because the basketball has a hole in it.\nB. Popular in America - This is a characteristic of basketballs generally and does not depend on whether the ball has a hole in it.\nC. Full of air - This would not be true because a hole in the basketball would cause the air to escape.\nD. Gone - This is irrelevant to the condition of the basketball having a hole.\nE. Round - This would still be true because the basketball maintains its general shape, which includes being round.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC. full of air"}]
