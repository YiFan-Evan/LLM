However, if we interpret the question as asking which option completes the phrase in a meaningful way, let's analyze each option:\n\nA. friendship - This would imply that making friends was no personal friendship, which doesn't make sense in this context.\nB. conflict - This could imply that making friends was not a source of personal conflict for him, but it doesn't fit well with the idea of being outgoing.\nC. good feeling - This suggests that making friends was not a good feeling for him, which contradicts the idea of being outgoing.\nD. having friends - This could mean that making friends was not about having friends for him, which is confusing and doesn't fit the context.\nE. scary - This implies that making friends was not a scary experience for him, which aligns with the idea of being outgoing.\n\nConsidering the context of being outgoing, the most fitting option that completes the phrase meaningfully would be:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}]
