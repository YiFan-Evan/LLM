They are understood by children to be fantasies or imaginations.\nE. people believe - This option is too vague and doesn't directly relate to the idea of something being \"pretend.\"\n\nConsidering the context of the question, the most likely answer would be something that a child might perceive as pretend due to its abstract nature or because it involves beliefs that are not easily visualized or understood.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. religion"}]
