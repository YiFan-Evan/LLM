However, assuming the correct options are intended to be:\n\nA. Iowa B. Kentucky C. Desert D. Town E. England\n\nThe thought process would be:\n\n- The term \"corner shop\" is commonly used in the UK, specifically in England, to refer to small local stores or convenience stores.\n- In the United States, \"corner shop\" can also be used but is less common than terms like \"grocery store\" or \"convenience store.\"\n- The other options like \"Kentucky,\" \"Desert,\" and \"Town\" do not specifically indicate a place where you would typically find a corner shop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nE.
