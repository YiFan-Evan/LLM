Strikes are usually called off when the demands of the unions are met by the employers, resulting in an agreement that satisfies both parties.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. union - This option seems unrelated to the demands needed to end a strike. It doesn't specify any type of demand.\nB. return to work - This is not a demand made by the union; rather, it is an action that may occur after the demands are met.\nC. not go to work - This is the opposite of what is needed for the strike to end. It represents the continuation of the strike, not its conclusion.\nD. more money - While this could be a demand that leads to the end of a strike, it is too specific and doesn't encompass all possible types of demands that could end a strike.\nE. reasonable - This option suggests that the demands are fair and acceptable to both parties, which is a common characteristic of demands that lead to the end of a strike.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nE. reasonable"}]
