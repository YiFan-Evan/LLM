Among the options provided, \"learn to walk\" is a phase that babies go through which requires significant time, patience, and supervision from parents. This stage can be particularly challenging because it involves ensuring the baby's safety while they explore mobility, often leading to falls or accidents. The other options do not necessarily represent challenges in raising a baby in the same way. For example, \"arrive early,\" \"boy or girl,\" and \"bring joy\" are not inherently problematic, and \"talk nonsense\" is a normal part of language development rather than a challenge.

Among the options provided, \"talk nonsense\" refers to babies not being able to communicate effectively through words, which can lead to misunderstandings and difficulties in understanding their needs and comforting them.
