Let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. direct sunlight - This is a plausible answer as it directly addresses the lack of shade.\nB. eat cake - This is unrelated to the given context.\nC. sunny place - While this implies sunlight, it doesn't specifically address the absence of shade.\nD. bright sunshine - This is similar to \"direct sunlight\" and could also be a plausible answer.\nE. full sunlight - This is essentially the same as \"direct sunlight.\"\n\nBetween A and D, both are strong candidates.
