The setting of the sun is a downward movement, not an upward one.\nB. near - Seeing something rise could imply that you are close enough to observe it as it ascends. This could be a reasonable option.\nC. fall - This is the opposite of what is described. If you see something rise, it is not falling.\nD. below - If you are below something that is rising, it would appear to be rising to you because its position relative to yours is increasing. This could also be a reasonable option.\nE. lower - This is similar to option D, suggesting that you are at a lower elevation than the object that is rising.\n\nConsidering the options, both B and D/E make sense in the context of seeing something rise.
