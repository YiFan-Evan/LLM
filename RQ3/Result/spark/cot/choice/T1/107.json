This is a natural and inevitable part of life for all organisms. The other options do not accurately describe what happens immediately after birth. \"Start reproduction\" (E) is not an immediate consequence of birth; organisms need to mature before they can reproduce. \"Death\" (D) is the end of life, not the start. \"Sometimes bad\" (C) is too vague and does not specifically relate to the life cycle. \"Expiration\" (A) typically refers to the end of a product's shelf life or usefulness, which is not applicable here.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. growing older."}]
