Elevation refers to the height or raised position of a place. Therefore, the opposite would be a lowered or sunken position.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. Disgust - This is an emotion and not related to geographical features.\nB. Reduction - This implies decreasing in size or amount but doesn't directly relate to elevation changes.\nC. Depression - This can refer to a dip or a sunken area in the landscape, which is the direct opposite of elevation.\nD. Demotion - This usually refers to a decrease in rank or status, not geographical terms.\nE. Diminishment - This also implies a reduction but is more abstract and doesn't specifically refer to geographical features.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nC. depression"}]
