This is a valid reason.\nB. **Backache** - This is unrelated to the car's ability to drive and pertains to the driver's physical condition.\nC. **Pollution** - Severe pollution might force road closures or make driving hazardous, but it's less likely to directly stop a car that is already driving.\nD. **Smoke** - Smoke coming from the car often indicates a serious mechanical issue, potentially preventing further driving. This is a valid reason.\nE. **Low fuel tank** - Running out of fuel will definitely stop the car from continuing to drive. This is a valid reason.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nA.
