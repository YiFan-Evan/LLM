Indestructible: This means that the film cannot be destroyed under any circumstances. This is an absolute term and might be too strong for the context given, as it suggests complete immunity to all forms of damage.\n- B. Durable: This implies that the film can withstand wear and tear over time. It's a relative term and could be appropriate, but it doesn't specifically address the fragility mentioned in the question.\n- C. Undestroyable: Similar to \"indestructible,\" this also suggests complete immunity to destruction, which might be too strong a claim based on the information given.\n- D. Indestructible: Again, this is similar to \"undestroyable\" and \"indestructible,\" suggesting an absolute resistance to destruction, which might be too strong for the context.\n- E. Unbreakable: This term specifically addresses the fragility mentioned in the question. It suggests that despite appearing delicate, the film is strong enough to withstand typical use or stress without breaking.\n\nGiven the context and the options available, the most suitable answer is:\nE. Unbreakable\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}]
