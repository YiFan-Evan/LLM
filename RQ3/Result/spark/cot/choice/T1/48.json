Strikes usually occur due to unmet demands or grievances, and they often end when both parties can agree on terms that are considered reasonable by the workers and acceptable to the employers.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. reasonable - This suggests that the demands made by the union should be fair and justifiable, which is a key component in resolving a strike. However, it doesn't specify what those reasonable demands entail.\nB. more money - While financial compensation is often a point of contention in strikes, simply demanding \"more money\" without context is not specific enough to be a complete answer.\nC. not go to work - This is an action rather than a demand, and it contradicts the goal of ending a strike, which requires returning to work.\nD. return to work - This is also an action, indicating the cessation of the strike, but it does not describe the nature of the demands that would lead to this outcome.\nE. union - This option is unclear as it stands alone; it does not provide information about the demands that would end a strike.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most appropriate answer would be one that indicates the demands are both reasonable and specific to the issues at hand. Since option A (\"reasonable\") is the most general and encompassing term that could include various specific demands like better working conditions, higher pay, improved benefits, etc., it seems to be the best fit.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nA. reasonable"}]
