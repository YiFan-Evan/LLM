Home - A home can vary greatly in size, and the dining area can be either large or small depending on the overall size of the house. However, it's more likely that a home would have a smaller dining area compared to commercial establishments.\nC. Mall - Malls usually have food courts with numerous seating options, making the dining area quite large.\nD.
