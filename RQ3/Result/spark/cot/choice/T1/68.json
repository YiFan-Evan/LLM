Therefore, this option is not suitable for showcasing silk.\n\nB. mulberry tree - Mulberry trees are where silkworms feed on the leaves, but they are not related to displaying silk in a finished product.\n\nC. garments - Garments can be made from silk and would be an appropriate choice to showcase its beauty and qualities. However, this term is very broad and does not specifically indicate luxury or high-end fashion.\n\nD. expensive clothing - This option suggests that the silk is being used in high-end, luxurious clothing items, which could be a great way to show off the quality and elegance of silk.\n\nE. parachutes - Parachutes are typically made of strong, durable materials like nylon or polyester, not silk. Thus, this option is not suitable for showcasing silk.\n\nConsidering the context of showing off silk, the most appropriate options would be those that highlight the luxurious and elegant nature of the fabric. Between \"expensive clothing\" (D) and \"garments\" (C), \"expensive clothing\" is more specific and directly relates to the idea of showcasing silk in a high-end manner.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. expensive clothing."}]
