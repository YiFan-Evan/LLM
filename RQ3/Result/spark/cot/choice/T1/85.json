In the context of the question, it's likely that the sound of the motor was loud enough to drown out his cries for help. The other options (surface of earth, teardrops, snowflake, typhoon) do not logically fit the scenario described."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Joe was thrown from his boat into the water.

However, his cries were drowned out by another sound. Given the context of being on a boat, the most likely source of noise that would drown out a person's cries is the sound of the boat's motor. The other options (typhoon, snowflake, teardrops, surface of earth) do not make as much sense in this context."}]
