It's a plausible option.\nB. sporting - This is similar to A but even more general. It refers to anything related to sports.\nC. basketball - In basketball, the ball is not typically hit over a boundary (like in cricket or baseball) to strike an audience member. This seems less likely.\nD. society - This doesn't relate to any kind of game or sport.\nE. ranch country - This also doesn't relate to any kind of game or sport.\n\nConsidering the context of the question, the most specific and accurate answer would be the one that directly relates to a scenario where a ball could be hit over a boundary and potentially strike an audience member. While both A and B are possible, A (\"sporting event\") is more specific than B (\"sporting\").\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A."}]
