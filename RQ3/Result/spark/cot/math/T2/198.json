However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to symbolic integration tools or tables that provide us with the antiderivative. For many complex integrals, software like Mathematica, Maple, or even online integrators can be used.\n\nAssuming we have computed the integral (using such tools), we get:\n\\[ \\int \\ln(\\cos(x)) e^x \\, dx = e^x \\ln(\\cos(x)) - \\int e^x \\tan(x) \\, dx \\]\n\nThe second integral \\( \\int e^x \\tan(x) \\, dx \\) is also non-trivial and typically requires special functions or numerical methods for an explicit solution.
