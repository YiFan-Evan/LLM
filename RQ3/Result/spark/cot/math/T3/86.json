We can split this into two separate integrals and then add them together.\n\n#### Integral of \\( \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\)\nThis part does not have an elementary antiderivative, so we will leave it in its integral form:\n\\[ \\int \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\, dx \\]\n\n#### Integral of \\( x \\)\nThe integral of \\( x \\) is straightforward:\n\\[ \\int x \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} \\]\n\nCombining these, the indefinite integral of \\( \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} + x \\) is:\n\\[ \\int \\left( \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} + x \\right) \\, dx = \\int \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\, dx + \\int x \\, dx = \\int \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\, dx + \\frac{x^2}{2} \\]\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 4 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 4 \\) into the expression for the indefinite integral:\n\\[ \\text{Result at } x = 4 = \\int \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\, dx + \\frac{4^2}{2} = \\int \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\, dx + 8 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Round Down to the Nearest Integer\n\nSince we cannot evaluate the integral \\(\\int \\frac{e^x}{\\cos(x)} \\, dx\\) in terms of elementary functions, we will use a numerical approximation to find its value at \\( x = 4 \\).
