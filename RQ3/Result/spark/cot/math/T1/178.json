Let $ u = \\sin(x) $ and $ du = \\cos(x) \\, dx $. Then, $ \\sin^2(x) = u^2 $. For $ \\sinh(x) $, we know that $ \\sinh(x) = \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} $, but this form does not easily integrate with $ \\sin^2(x) $. Therefore, we proceed directly with the substitution for $ \\sin(x) $.\n\nThe integral becomes:\n$$ \\int \\frac{u^2}{\\sinh(x)} \\, du $$\n\nThis integral is complex due to the presence of $ \\sinh(x) $ in the denominator, and it does not have a straightforward elementary antiderivative.
