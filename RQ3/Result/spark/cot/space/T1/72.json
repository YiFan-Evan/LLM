This takes us to the spiny lobster.\n   - From the spiny lobster, moving clockwise by 4 more steps takes us to the European garden spider (since 8 + 4 = 12, and 12 % 10 = 2, counting from 0 again, it's the second item from the spiny lobster).\n   - Now, moving counter-clockwise by 4 steps from the European garden spider takes us back to the tights (since 2 - 4 = -2, adding 10 for positive indexing gives us 8, which counts back two items from the European garden spider to the tights).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: tights."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
