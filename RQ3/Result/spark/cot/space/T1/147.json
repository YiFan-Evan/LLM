So, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving \\(20 - 15 = 5\\) steps clockwise from the langur's position (17). This lands us on the 2nd dot, which is the hook.\n\n2. **Move clockwise by 6 steps from the current position (hook at position 2)**: \\(2 + 6 = 8\\). This lands us on the 8th dot, which is the Dobermann.\n\n3. **Move clockwise by 12 steps from the current position (Dobermann at position 8)**: \\(8 + 12 = 20\\). Since the circle has only 20 dots, moving past the 20th dot loops us back to the 1st dot. Therefore, we land on the 1st dot, which is the printer.\n\n4. **Move clockwise by 8 steps from the current position (printer at position 1)**: \\(1 + 8 = 9\\).
