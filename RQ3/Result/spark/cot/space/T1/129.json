You start on the padlock at position 20 (since there are 20 dots and you start at the top).\n2. You move 13 steps in a clockwise direction from the padlock. Since the map is circular and has 20 dots, you calculate the new position as:\n   - \\( 20 + 13 = 33 \\)\n   - The actual position is found by taking the remainder of 33 divided by 20:\n   - \\( 33 \\mod 20 = 13 \\)\n   - Therefore, you end up at position 13, which is the gorilla.\n\n3.
