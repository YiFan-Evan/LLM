You start from the Maltese and move in various steps around the circle as described.\n\nHere\u2019s how we can track your movements:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Maltese (position 4)\n2. **Move Counter-Clockwise by 3 Steps**: Since you're moving counter-clockwise, subtract 3 from your current position (4 - 3 = 1). The item at dot 1 is a lampshade.\n3. **Move Clockwise by 19 Steps**: Moving clockwise means adding steps to your current position. Add 19 to your current position (1 + 19 = 20). Since there are only 20 dots, wrap around to the beginning: 20 % 20 = 0. The item at dot 0 (starting point again) is an electric ray.\n4. **Move Counter-Clockwise by 13 Steps**: Subtract 13 from your current position (0 - 13 = -13). To find the correct position, add 20 until it's within the range of 0 to 19: -13 + 20 = 7.
