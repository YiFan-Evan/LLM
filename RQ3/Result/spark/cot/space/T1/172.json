Move 1 step in a clockwise direction from the Arctic fox.\n2. Move 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction from the new position.\n3. Move 20 steps in a clockwise direction from the current position.\n\nSince moving 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction essentially cancels out the previous clockwise step, you are back at the Arctic fox after these two initial moves. Now, starting from the Arctic fox, you move 20 steps in a clockwise direction. As mentioned earlier, moving 20 steps in a circular path with 20 items means that you would end up back at your starting point, which is the Arctic fox.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Arctic fox."}]
