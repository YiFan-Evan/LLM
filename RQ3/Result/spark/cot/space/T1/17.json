Here's how we can approach it:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Point:**\n   - The starting point is the square academic cap.\n\n2. **Determine the Position of Each Item:**\n   - Ocean liner (start)\n   - Fox squirrel\n   - Bassinet\n   - Square academic cap\n   - Remote control\n\n3. **Follow the Movements:**\n   - First movement: Move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction from the square academic cap. This leads to the remote control.\n   - Second movement: Move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction from the remote control. This leads back to the square academic cap.\n   - Third movement: Move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the square academic cap. Moving 5 steps from the square academic cap in a clockwise direction will take you back to the square academic cap after completing one full circle.\n\n4. **Count the Steps:**\n   - From the square academic cap, moving 1 step clockwise takes you to the remote control.\n   - From the remote control, moving 1 step counter-clockwise takes you back to the square academic cap.\n   - From the square academic cap, moving 5 steps clockwise brings you back to the square academic cap after completing one full circle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: square academic cap."}]
