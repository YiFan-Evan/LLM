Old English Sheepdog\n\nNow, you are at the upright piano which is in position 7. Let's follow your movements step by step:\n\n1. You move 6 steps counter-clockwise from position 7:\n   - Counter-clockwise means moving backward.\n   - Position 7 to 6 is one step back.\n   - Position 6 to 5 is another step back.\n   - Position 5 to 4 is another step back.\n   - Position 4 to 3 is another step back.\n   - Position 3 to 2 is another step back.\n   - Position 2 to 1 is another step back.\n   - Position 1 to 10 is another step back.\n   - Position 10 to 9 is another step back.\n   - Position 9 to 8 is another step back.\n   - Position 8 to 7 is another step back.\n   - So, after 6 steps counter-clockwise from position 7, you end up at position 1 (Digital Clock).\n\n2. Next, you move 3 steps counter-clockwise from position 1 (Digital Clock):\n   - Following the same logic as above:\n   - Position 1 to 10 is one step back.\n   - Position 10 to 9 is another step back.\n   - Position 9 to 8 is another step back.\n   - After 3 steps counter-clockwise from position 1, you end up at position 8 (Goldfish).\n\n3. Finally, you move 4 steps clockwise from position 8 (Goldfish):\n   - Clockwise means moving forward.\n   - Position 8 to 9 is one step forward.\n   - Position 9 to 10 is another step forward.\n   - Position 10 to 1 is another step forward.\n   - Position 1 to 2 is another step forward.\n   - After 4 steps clockwise from position 8, you end up at position 2 (Dust Jacket).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Dust Jacket."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
