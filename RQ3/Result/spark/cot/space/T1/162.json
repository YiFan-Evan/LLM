From there, we move to the carton, which is the 18th item, then perform three more movements as described:\n\n1. Move counter-clockwise by 10 steps from the carton (18th item).\n   - Counter-clockwise movement means subtracting steps from the current position.\n   - New position = 18 - 10 = 8 (modulo 20) = 8th item (English Setter).\n\n2. Move clockwise by 16 steps from the English Setter (8th item).\n   - Clockwise movement means adding steps to the current position.\n   - New position = 8 + 16 = 24 (modulo 20) = 4th item (Baseball).\n\n3.
