Baboon\n10. Bell-cot\n\nStarting from the limousine (position 6), let's calculate the final position after the given movements:\n\n1. Move counter-clockwise by 9 steps from the limousine:\n   - Start at position 6.\n   - Move 9 steps counter-clockwise: \\( 6 - 9 = -3 \\). Since the path is circular and has 10 positions, we add 10 to any negative result to find the equivalent positive position: \\( -3 + 10 = 7 \\).\n   - The new position is 7, which corresponds to the Soccer Ball.\n\n2. Move clockwise by 7 steps from the new position (Soccer Ball):\n   - Start at position 7.\n   - Move 7 steps clockwise: \\( 7 + 7 = 14 \\). Since the path is circular and has 10 positions, we take the remainder of 14 divided by 10: \\( 14 \\mod 10 = 4 \\).\n   - The new position is 4, which corresponds to the Crane (bird).\n\n3. Move clockwise by 6 steps from the new position (Crane):\n   - Start at position 4.\n   - Move 6 steps clockwise: \\( 4 + 6 = 10 \\). Since the path is circular and has 10 positions, \\( 10 \\mod 10 = 0 \\).\n   - The new position is 0, but since we start counting from 1, we adjust it to 10.
