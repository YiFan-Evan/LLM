Starting from the common redshank, move 16 steps counter-clockwise.\n2. Then, move an additional 20 steps counter-clockwise from the new position.\n\nWe can represent these movements mathematically by calculating the effective number of steps moved in total:\nTotal steps = (16 + 20) % 20 = 36 % 20 = 16\n\nThis means that after completing the first 16 steps counter-clockwise and then another 20 steps counter-clockwise, you effectively move 16 steps counter-clockwise from the starting position (the common redshank).\n\nNow, we need to find what is 16 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank:\n- From common redshank, moving 16 steps counter-clockwise brings us to the screw.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nScrew"}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Starting from common redshank**: This is our initial position.\n\n2. **Move 1 step clockwise**: From common redshank, moving one step clockwise brings us to the pillow.\n\n3. **Move 1 step counter-clockwise**: From the pillow, moving one step counter-clockwise brings us back to the common redshank.\n\n4. **Move 16 steps counter-clockwise**: Now we move 16 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank. Since there are 20 dots total, moving 16 steps counter-clockwise from the common redshank means we go back 4 steps (20 - 16 = 4). So, counting backward from the common redshank:\n   - common redshank -> switch -> bath towel -> bookstore -> mud turtle -> chest -> golf ball -> crate -> Lhasa Apso -> patas monkey -> prison -> analog clock -> trolleybus -> car mirror -> eel -> screw -> acorn squash -> hyena -> dock -> pillow.\n\n5. **Move 20 steps counter-clockwise**: Moving 20 steps counter-clockwise from the current position (pillow) completes a full circle and returns us to the starting point, which is the common redshank again.\n\nTherefore, after all these movements, you will find the **common redshank**."}]
