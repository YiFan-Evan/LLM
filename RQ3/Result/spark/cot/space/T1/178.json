We start from the European polecat and move in the directions specified by the given steps.\n\n1. **Starting Point:**\n   - The European polecat is positioned at dot 5 (since it's the 5th item on the list).\n\n2. **Counter-clockwise Movement:**\n   - Move 15 steps counter-clockwise. Since we are moving counter-clockwise and the total number of dots is 20, subtract 15 from 5 to get \\( 5 - 15 = -10 \\).\n   - To convert this to a positive index within the range of 1 to 20, add 20 to -10: \\( -10 + 20 = 10 \\). So, after this step, you land at dot 10.\n\n3. **Clockwise Movement:**\n   - Move 9 steps clockwise from dot 10. Add 9 to 10: \\( 10 + 9 = 19 \\). So, after this step, you land at dot 19.\n\n4. **Another Clockwise Movement:**\n   - Move 14 steps clockwise from dot 19. Add 14 to 19: \\( 19 + 14 = 33 \\). Since 33 exceeds the number of dots, subtract 20 from 33 to wrap around the circle: \\( 33 - 20 = 13 \\). So, after this step, you land at dot 13.\n\n5. **Final Counter-clockwise Movement:**\n   - Move 20 steps counter-clockwise from dot 13. Subtract 20 from 13: \\( 13 - 20 = -7 \\). To convert this to a positive index within the range of 1 to 20, add 20 to -7: \\( -7 + 20 = 13 \\).
