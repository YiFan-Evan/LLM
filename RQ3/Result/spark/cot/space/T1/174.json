Starting from the crate, moving 16 steps clockwise:\n   - Since there are 20 dots on the path and moving 16 steps takes us to the 16th dot from the starting point (the crate).\n\n2. Then moving 19 steps counter-clockwise from the current position:\n   - Moving 19 steps counter-clockwise from the 16th dot means we are going backwards by 19 steps on a 20-dot circle. This can be calculated as \\(20 - 19 = 1\\). So, we end up at the dot immediately before the crate, which is the white stork.\n\n3. Next, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise from the current position (white stork):\n   - Continuing from the white stork and moving 13 steps backwards on the 20-dot path, we calculate the new position as \\(1 + 13 = 14\\) since we go backwards from dot 1.\n\n4.

Then moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the current position:\n   - Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the 1st dot means we are going backwards by 1 step on a 20-dot circle.

Next, moving 16 steps clockwise from the current position (ruffed grouse):\n   - From the ruffed grouse and moving 16 steps forward on the 20-dot path, we calculate the new position as \\(19 + 16 = 35\\). Since we have only 20 dots, we use modulo operation to find the equivalent position in the circle: \\(35 \\mod 20 = 5\\). So, we end up at the 5th dot from the start.\n\n4. Then moving 19 steps counter-clockwise from the current position:\n   - From the 5th dot, moving 19 steps backwards gives us \\(5 - 19 = -14\\).
