Move counter-clockwise by 5 steps from position 13:\n   - Counter-clockwise movement decreases the position number, so 13 - 5 = 8.\n   - You land at position 8, which is the Frying pan.\n\n2. Move counter-clockwise by 12 steps from position 8:\n   - Continuing counter-clockwise, 8 - 12 = -4. Since we are in a circle of 20, we add 20 to wrap around: -4 + 20 = 16.\n   - You land at position 16, which is the Barbell.\n\n3. Move clockwise by 15 steps from position 16:\n   - Clockwise movement increases the position number, so 16 + 15 = 31. To find the actual position, we take 31 modulo 20: 31 % 20 = 11.\n   - You land at position 11, which is the Cougar.\n\n4.
