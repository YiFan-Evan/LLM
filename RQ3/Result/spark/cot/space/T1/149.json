We know that there are 20 dots in total and each dot has a unique item associated with it. The starting position is at the top of the path where the pineapple is located, which we can denote as position 1.\n\nWe will number the positions from 1 to 20 clockwise starting from the pineapple:\n\n1. Pineapple\n2. English Springer Spaniel\n3. Snowmobile\n4. Tibetan Mastiff\n5. Parallel bars\n6. Binoculars\n7. Fiddler crab\n8. Goldfinch\n9. American black bear\n10. Torch\n11. Dung beetle\n12. Tile roof\n13. Wooden spoon\n14. Black swan\n15. Ear\n16. Oboe\n17. Paintbrush\n18. Bubble\n19. Baseball\n20. Snow leopard\n\nNow, we start from the goldfinch (position 8) and move counter-clockwise by 15 steps. Moving counter-clockwise means we subtract the number of steps from the current position:\n\n\\[ 8 - 15 = -7 \\]\n\nSince we are in a circular path with 20 dots, we need to handle negative indices by adding 20 until we get a positive index:\n\n\\[ -7 + 20 = 13 \\]\n\nTherefore, after moving 15 steps counter-clockwise from the goldfinch, we land on the wooden spoon (position 13).\n\nNext, we move clockwise by 15 steps from this new position. Moving clockwise means we add the number of steps to the current position:\n\n\\[ 13 + 15 = 28 \\]\n\nAgain, since the path is circular with 20 dots, we need to take this result modulo 20 to get a valid position:\n\n\\[ 28 \\mod 20 = 8 \\]\n\nPosition 8 corresponds to the goldfinch.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Goldfinch."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
