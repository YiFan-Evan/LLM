So, if the Lhasa Apso is at dot number 1, the golf cart would be at dot number 6.\n\n2. **First Movement**: Moving 13 steps in a clockwise direction from the golf cart (dot 6):\n   - Since there are 20 dots in total, moving 13 steps from dot 6 will wrap around the circle. The calculation for the new position is \\( (6 + 13) \\% 20 = 19 \\). So, after the first movement, you end up at dot 19, which is the spoonbill.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Moving 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the spoonbill (dot 19):\n   - Moving 10 steps counter-clockwise means moving 20 - 10 = 10 steps clockwise from dot 19. The calculation for the new position is \\( (19 + 10) \\% 20 = 29 \\% 20 = 9 \\). So, after the second movement, you end up at dot 9, which is the drum.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Moving 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the drum (dot 9):\n   - Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means moving 20 - 3 = 17 steps clockwise from dot 9. The calculation for the new position is \\( (9 + 17) \\% 20 = 26 \\% 20 = 6 \\).
