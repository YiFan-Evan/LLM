We will start from the snow leopard and move according to the instructions given.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Snow Leopard\n   - The snow leopard is at position 5 (since there are 4 items before it starting from the top).\n\n2. **First Movement**: 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction\n   - In a counter-clockwise direction, moving from position 5 by 9 steps means subtracting 9 from 5. Since we want a positive position within the range of 1 to 20, we calculate as follows:\n     \\[\n     5 - 9 = -4 \\quad (\\text{which corresponds to } 20 - 4 + 1 = 17)\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, after the first movement, you are at position 17, which is the disc brake.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: 3 steps in a clockwise direction\n   - From position 17, moving 3 steps in a clockwise direction means adding 3 to 17:\n     \\[\n     17 + 3 = 20\n     \\]\n   - Position 20 wraps around to position 1 because it's a circular path, so you end up at position 1, which is the hornbill.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction\n   - From position 1, moving 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction means subtracting 7 from 1:\n     \\[\n     1 - 7 = -6 \\quad (\\text{which corresponds to } 20 - 6 + 1 = 15)\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, after the third movement, you are at position 15, which is the leafhopper.\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: 6 steps in a clockwise direction\n   - From position 15, moving 6 steps in a clockwise direction means adding 6 to 15:\n     \\[\n     15 + 6 = 21 \\quad (\\text{which corresponds to } 21 - 20 = 1)\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, after the fourth movement, you are back at position 1, which is the hornbill.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **hornbill**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
