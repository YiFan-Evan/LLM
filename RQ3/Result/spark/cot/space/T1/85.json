You move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction from the jack-o'-lantern:\n   - Starting from position 9, moving 7 steps clockwise: \\(9 + 7 = 16\\)\n   - Since there are only 10 dots, we find the position by taking modulo 10: \\(16 \\mod 10 = 6\\)\n   - Position 6 is the hook.\n\n2. Next, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction from the hook:\n   - Starting from position 6, moving 9 steps clockwise: \\(6 + 9 = 15\\)\n   - Again, taking modulo 10: \\(15 \\mod 10 = 5\\)\n   - Position 5 is the southern black widow.\n\n3. Finally, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction from the southern black widow:\n   - Starting from position 5, moving 2 steps clockwise: \\(5 + 2 = 7\\)\n   - Position 7 is the fiddler crab.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **fiddler crab**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
