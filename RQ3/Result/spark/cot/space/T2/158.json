Since we are moving counter-clockwise and there are a total of 20 elements on the path, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise means you will land on the element that is 19 positions behind the gas pump. The elements are numbered from 1 to 20 starting with the mosquito net at position 1. The gas pump is in position 9. So, 9 - 19 = -10. To find the positive equivalent on a 20-element circle, we add 20 to -10: -10 + 20 = 10. This means the first stop is at position 10 which is the white-headed capuchin.\n3. **Second movement**: From the white-headed capuchin (position 10), move 15 steps clockwise. Clockwise addition on the circle means simply adding the number of steps to the current position number. So, 10 + 15 = 25. On a 20-element circle, to find the equivalent position, we take 25 mod 20 = 5. Therefore, the second stop is at position 5, which is the duck.\n4. **Third movement**: From the duck (position 5), move 12 steps clockwise. Adding again, 5 + 12 = 17. So, the third stop is at position 17, which is the leatherback sea turtle.\n5. **Fourth movement**: From the leatherback sea turtle (position 17), move 5 steps counter-clockwise. Subtracting, 17 - 5 = 12.

Since we are moving clockwise and there are a total of 20 elements on the path, moving 19 steps clockwise means you will land on the element that is 19 positions ahead of the common redshank. The common redshank is in position 13. So, 13 + 19 = 32. On a 20-element circle, to find the equivalent position, we take 32 mod 20 = 12.

Counter-clockwise subtraction on the circle means subtracting the number of steps from the current position number. So, 12 - 15 = -3.
