This means going backward on the circle. From position 3, moving back 2 steps gives us position 1, where the face powder is.\n3. **Second Movement**: Now, move clockwise by 5 steps from the face powder. From position 1, moving forward 5 steps takes us to position 6, where the canoe is located.\n4. **Third Movement**: Continue with a clockwise movement of 9 steps from the canoe. From position 6, adding 9 steps brings us to position 15 ((6 + 9) % 20 = 15), where the Leonberger is found.\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Finally, move counter-clockwise by 8 steps from the Leonberger.
