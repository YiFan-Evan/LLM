Move 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Dobermann (position 3):\n   Counter-clockwise means moving left. From position 3, moving left by 4 steps takes us to position 3 - 4 = -1. Since the positions are cyclic and there are 10 elements, we add 10 to any negative positions to wrap them around. So, -1 + 10 = 9. Position 9 corresponds to the **Television**.\n\n2.
