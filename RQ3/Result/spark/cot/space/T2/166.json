Starting from the Maltese (which is 3rd item if starting from the electric ray as the first item), let's follow your steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: Maltese at position 3.\n2. **Move Counter-Clockwise by 3 Steps**: Since moving counter-clockwise reduces the position number, subtract 3 from the current position: 3 - 3 = 0. However, since positions are zero-indexed but our counting starts from 1, we adjust by adding 1 to make it fit within the 1-20 range. The new position is 20 + 0 = 20 (adjusted for circular nature of the map). At position 20 lies the Pekingese.\n3. **Move Clockwise by 19 Steps**: Moving clockwise increases the position number. Add 19 to the current position: 20 + 19 = 39. To find the actual position on a 20-item circle, we take modulo 20: 39 % 20 = 19. At position 19 lies the chainsaw.\n4. **Move Counter-Clockwise by 13 Steps**: Subtract 13 from the current position: 19 - 13 = 6.
