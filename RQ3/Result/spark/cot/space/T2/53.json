Now, moving clockwise by 7 steps from the screw, we count forward. Since moving clockwise means going right, and we are at the 4th position, counting forward 7 steps will take us to the 10th position, then back to the 1st position (because it's a circular path), and continue counting until we reach the 7th position, where we find the Labrador Retriever.\n4. Finally, moving clockwise by 5 steps from the Labrador Retriever, we count forward another 5 positions from the 7th position. This takes us to the 12th position, but since it's a circular path with only 10 positions, we wrap around and count from the beginning again. Counting forward 2 more positions from the 10th position brings us to the 2nd position, where we find the Border Collie.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Border Collie."}]
