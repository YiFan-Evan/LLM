Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we will subtract 8 from the current position (which is 2 for the breakwater):\n   - New position = 2 - 8 = -6\n   - Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we add 20 to make it positive: -6 + 20 = 14\n   - At position 14, we find the Granny Smith.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 16 steps in a clockwise direction from the Granny Smith. Since we are moving clockwise, we will add 16 to the current position (which is 14 for the Granny Smith):\n   - New position = 14 + 16 = 30\n   - Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we take modulo 20 to find the actual position: 30 % 20 = 10\n   - At position 10, we find the baluster.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the baluster.
