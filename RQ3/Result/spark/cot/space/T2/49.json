We know that the path consists of 10 connected dots and you are starting from the dot at the top of the path where the projectile is located.

Measuring cup\n7. Polar bear\n8. Soup bowl\n9. Spindle\n10. Toilet paper\n\nNow, let's analyze your movements:\n- You start at the spindle (position 9).\n- You move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction.\n- Then you move around the ring by 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nFirst, calculate the position after moving 9 steps in a clockwise direction from the spindle:\nStarting from position 9, moving 9 steps clockwise:\n\\( 9 + 9 = 18 \\)\nSince there are only 10 positions, we need to find the equivalent position within the range of 1 to 10. To do this, we take the remainder of 18 when divided by 10:\n\\( 18 \\mod 10 = 8 \\)\nSo, after moving 9 steps clockwise, you end up at position 8, which is the soup bowl.\n\nNext, calculate the position after moving 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the soup bowl (position 8):\nMoving 10 steps counter-clockwise means moving 2 steps clockwise (because moving 10 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise since \\( 10 - 2 = 8 \\), and 8 steps counter-clockwise would complete one full circle back to the starting point).\nSo, from position 8, moving 2 steps clockwise:\n\\( 8 + 2 = 10 \\)\nPosition 10 corresponds to the toilet paper.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: toilet paper."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
