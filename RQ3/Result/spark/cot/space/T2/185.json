Here is the step-by-step thought process:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: You start at the tiger beetle, which is located on the 4th dot in the clockwise direction from the partridge (the starting point).\n\n2. **First Movement**: Move 17 steps in a clockwise direction from the tiger beetle. Since there are 20 dots in total, moving 17 steps will take you to the \\( 4 + 17 = 21 \\)st dot. However, since it's a circular path with only 20 dots, you need to find the position within those 20 dots by calculating \\( 21 \\mod 20 = 1 \\). So, you land on the 1st dot, which is the partridge.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Next, you move 2 steps in a clockwise direction from the partridge. This means going to the \\( 1 + 2 = 3 \\)rd dot, which is the Black and Tan Coonhound.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Then, you move 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Black and Tan Coonhound. Since moving counter-clockwise means subtracting from the current position, you go to the \\( 3 - 7 = -4 \\)th dot. To find the correct position within the circle, add 20 until the result is within the range of 1 to 20: \\( -4 + 20 = 16 \\). So, you land on the 16th dot, which is the Granny Smith.\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Finally, you move 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Granny Smith.
