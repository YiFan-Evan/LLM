Since there are 20 items, moving 16 steps from position 15 will wrap around the circle. To find the new position:\n\\[ 15 + 16 \\equiv 1 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 20) \\]\nSo, you land at position 1, which is the tabby cat.\n\n**Step 3:** Move 19 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. This means moving 19 steps backwards from the current position. To find the new position:\n\\[ 1 - 19 \\equiv -18 \\equiv 2 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 20) \\]\nSo, you land at position 2, which is the loupe.\n\n**Step 4:** Move 13 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Again, move 13 steps backwards from the current position. To find the new position:\n\\[ 2 - 13 \\equiv -11 \\equiv 9 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 20) \\]\nSo, you land at position 9, which is the partridge.\n\n**Step 5:** Move 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Move 5 steps backwards from the current position. To find the new position:\n\\[ 9 - 5 \\equiv 4 \\ (\\text{mod} \\ 20) \\]\nSo, you land at position 4, which is the black-and-white colobus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **black-and-white colobus**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
