Starting from the snow leopard, we will follow the instructions given in the question.\n\n1. **Starting position**: The snow leopard is at position 5 (since there are 4 items before it).\n\n2. **First movement**: Move 9 steps counter-clockwise from the snow leopard. Since moving counter-clockwise reduces the position number, we subtract 9 from 5:\n   - $5 - 9 = -4$.\n   - To convert this into a positive index within the circular path of 20 items, we add 20 to -4:\n   - $-4 + 20 = 16$.\n   - Position after the first movement: 16.\n\n3. **Second movement**: Move 3 steps clockwise from position 16. Moving clockwise increases the position number, so we add 3 to 16:\n   - $16 + 3 = 19$.\n   - Position after the second movement: 19.\n\n4. **Third movement**: Move 7 steps counter-clockwise from position 19.
