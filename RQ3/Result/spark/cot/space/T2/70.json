Indigo bunting\n10. Candle\n\nNow, starting from the dung beetle (position 6), let's trace your movements:\n\n- First, you move 4 steps counter-clockwise from the dung beetle. Moving counter-clockwise means going backwards in the sequence. From position 6, moving back 4 steps takes you to position 2 (since there are 10 dots, and 10 - 4 = 6, then 6 - 4 = 2). At position 2, you find a CRT screen.\n- Next, you move another 4 steps counter-clockwise from the CRT screen. Again moving counter-clockwise from position 2, you land on position 8 (since 2 - 4 = -2, and adding 10 gives us 8). At position 8, you encounter a sidewinder.\n- Finally, you move 10 steps clockwise from the sidewinder. Moving clockwise means going forwards in the sequence. From position 8, moving forward by 10 steps takes you to position 6 (since 8 + 10 = 18, and taking modulo 10 leaves us with 8). At position 6, you once again find a dung beetle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Dung beetle."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
