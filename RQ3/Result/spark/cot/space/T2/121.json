Starting from the snoek, we'll move step by step according to the instructions:\n\n1. **Start at the snoek**: The snoek is in position 9 (since there are 8 items before it on the list starting from the ox).\n2. **Move clockwise by 13 steps**: From position 9, moving 13 steps clockwise means we calculate \\(9 + 13 = 22\\). Since the path is only 20 dots, we find the position within this range by taking the remainder when dividing by 20: \\(22 \\mod 20 = 2\\). So, we land on the second item in the list, which is the Otterhound.\n3. **Move clockwise by 3 steps**: Now starting from the Otterhound (position 2), moving 3 steps further clockwise gives us \\(2 + 3 = 5\\). Therefore, we end up at the tow truck.\n4. **Move clockwise by 3 steps again**: From the tow truck (position 5), moving another 3 steps clockwise results in \\(5 + 3 = 8\\). This places us at the bikini.\n5. **Move counter-clockwise by 12 steps**: Moving counter-clockwise by 12 steps from the bikini (position 8) means we subtract 12: \\(8 - 12 = -4\\). To adjust for negative positions in a circular path, we add 20 until we get a positive number within the range: \\(20 - 4 = 16\\).
