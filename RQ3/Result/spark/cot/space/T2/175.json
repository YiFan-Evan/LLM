Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we use modulo arithmetic to find the new position:\n     \\[\n     16 + 5 = 21 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 21 \\mod 20 = 1\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, you end up at position 1, where you find an Egyptian Mau.\n\n3. **Second movement - counter-clockwise by 12 steps:**\n   - From position 1, moving 12 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 12 from 1. Again, using modulo arithmetic:\n     \\[\n     1 - 12 = -11 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (-11 + 20) \\mod 20 = 9\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, you end up at position 9, where you find a castle.\n\n4. **Third movement - clockwise by 5 steps:**\n   - From position 9, moving 5 steps clockwise means adding 5 to 9:\n     \\[\n     9 + 5 = 14\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, you end up at position 14, where you find a baseball player.\n\n5. **Fourth movement - counter-clockwise by 3 steps:**\n   - From position 14, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 3 from 14:\n     \\[\n     14 - 3 = 11\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, you end up at position 11, where you find a radiator.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: radiator."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
