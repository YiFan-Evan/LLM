Start at the dog sled, which is located at the top of the path.\n2. Move around the ring in a counter-clockwise direction by 9 steps:\n   - Since the path is circular and has only 10 elements, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise from the dog sled will land us on the second element clockwise from the dog sled.\n   - The second element clockwise from the dog sled is the barn.\n3. Next, move around the ring in a counter-clockwise direction by 2 steps:\n   - Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the barn brings us to the eighth element clockwise from the barn.\n   - The eighth element clockwise from the barn is the birdhouse.\n4. Finally, move around the ring in a clockwise direction by 2 steps:\n   - Moving 2 steps clockwise from the birdhouse brings us to the tenth element counter-clockwise from the birdhouse.\n   - The tenth element counter-clockwise from the birdhouse is the red-breasted merganser.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: red-breasted merganser."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
