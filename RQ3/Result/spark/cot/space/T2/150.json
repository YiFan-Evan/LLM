Then, we move 8 steps counter-clockwise again.\n3. Finally, we move 8 steps clockwise.\n\nLet's calculate each step:\n\n- **Step 1**: Move 17 steps counter-clockwise from the lion. Since moving counter-clockwise reduces the position index, we subtract 17 from the initial index of the lion (13) and add 20 if the result is negative (because it's a circular path):\n  \\[\n  13 - 17 = -4 \\quad (\\text{mod} \\ 20) \\\\\n  -4 + 20 = 16\n  \\]\n  The item at dot 16 is a pencil case.\n\n- **Step 2**: Move 8 steps counter-clockwise from the pencil case (dot 16). Again, subtract 8 and add 20 if necessary:\n  \\[\n  16 - 8 = 8\n  \\]\n  The item at dot 8 is a hot dog.\n\n- **Step 3**: Move 8 steps clockwise from the hot dog (dot 8).
