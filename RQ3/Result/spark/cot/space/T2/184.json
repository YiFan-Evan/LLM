Next, moving 5 steps clockwise from position 2 (teddy bear):\n   2 + 5 = 7 (this corresponds to the printer)\n\n4. Finally, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise from position 7 (printer):\n   To move counter-clockwise, we subtract 13 from the current position:\n   7 - 13 = -6\n   Since we need a positive position, add 20 to wrap around the circle:\n   -6 + 20 = 14 (this corresponds to the oboe)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Oboe**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
