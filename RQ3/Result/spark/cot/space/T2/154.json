Starting from the ptarmigan, which is located in position 9 (since there are 8 items before it), we first move 2 steps in a clockwise direction. This can be calculated as:\n   - Position of ptarmigan + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11 (modulo 20)\n   - Since 11 is less than 20, it wraps around without crossing the starting point, so we find the item at position 11.\n\n2.
