The positions are cyclic, so if the result is negative, we add 20 to wrap it back around.\n\\[ P_1 = P_0 - 13 = \\text{Afghan Hound Index} - 13 \\]\nIf the index is less than zero, adjust it:\n\\[ P_1 = (\\text{Afghan Hound Index} - 13 + 20) \\mod 20 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Second Move (Counter-Clockwise by 15 Steps)\n\\[ P_2 = P_1 - 15 \\]\nAgain, adjust for negative index:\n\\[ P_2 = (\\text{Index after first move} - 15 + 20) \\mod 20 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Third Move (Counter-Clockwise by 13 Steps)\n\\[ P_3 = P_2 - 13 \\]\nAdjust for negative index:\n\\[ P_3 = (\\text{Index after second move} - 13 + 20) \\mod 20 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Fourth Move (Counter-Clockwise by 8 Steps)\n\\[ P_4 = P_3 - 8 \\]\nAdjust for negative index:\n\\[ P_4 = (\\text{Index after third move} - 8 + 20) \\mod 20 \\]\n\nNow let's compute these positions step by step.
