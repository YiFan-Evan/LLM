Triceratops\n2. Plunger\n3. Rhinoceros Beetle\n4. Gazelle\n5. Angora Rabbit\n6. Syringe\n7. Airedale Terrier\n8. Electric Guitar\n9. Nile Crocodile\n10. Revolver\n11. Bathtub\n12.

Loggerhead Sea Turtle\n\nNow, starting from the King Charles Spaniel (item 12), if you move 15 steps in a clockwise direction, you will land on:\n\n12 + 15 = 27\n\nSince there are only 20 items, we need to find the equivalent position within the range of 1 to 20. To do this, we take the remainder of the division by 20:\n\n27 % 20 = 7\n\nSo, moving 15 steps in a clockwise direction from the King Charles Spaniel brings you to the 7th item on the path, which is the **electric guitar**.\n\nNext, if you start again from the King Charles Spaniel and move 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, you need to subtract 15 from the starting point (12):\n\n12 - 15 = -3\n\nAgain, since we want a positive position within the range of 1 to 20, we add 20 to the result to wrap around the circle:\n\n-3 + 20 = 17\n\nSo, moving 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the King Charles Spaniel brings you to the 17th item on the path, which is the **spotlight**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: electric guitar, spotlight."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
