Chambered nautilus\n20. Backpack\n\nNow, let's track the movements step-by-step:\n\n1. **Start at the golf ball (position 1)**\n2. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Since moving counter-clockwise reduces the position number, we subtract 8 from the current position (1): \\( 1 - 8 = -7 \\).\n   - To convert this into a positive position within the circular path, we add 20 to it: \\( -7 + 20 = 13 \\).\n   - Position 13 corresponds to the Alpine ibex.\n3. From the Alpine ibex (position 13), move 5 steps clockwise:\n   - Moving clockwise increases the position number, so we add 5 to the current position (13): \\( 13 + 5 = 18 \\).\n   - Position 18 corresponds to the otter.\n4. From the otter (position 18), move 16 steps clockwise:\n   - Adding 16 to the current position (18): \\( 18 + 16 = 34 \\).\n   - Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we need to find the equivalent position within the range of 1 to 20: \\( 34 \\mod 20 = 14 \\).\n   - Position 14 corresponds to the pirate ship.\n5. From the pirate ship (position 14), move 14 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Subtracting 14 from the current position (14): \\( 14 - 14 = 0 \\).\n   - Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we need to find the equivalent position within the range of 1 to 20: \\( 0 + 20 = 20 \\).\n   - Position 20 corresponds to the backpack.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **backpack**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
