Since the path has only 10 positions, and it's a circle, we use modulo 10 to find the new position:\n   - \\( (7 + 9) \\% 10 = 16 \\% 10 = 6 \\).

When moving counter-clockwise, negative results are adjusted by adding 10 until a positive remainder within the range of 1 to 10 is reached. Here, since \\(-4 + 10 = 6\\), you remain at the 6th position after this movement as well.
