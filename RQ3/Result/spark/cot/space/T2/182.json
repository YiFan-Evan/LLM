This means subtracting 2 from the initial position, which gives us:\n   - \\(3 - 2 = 1\\)\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the new position. This means subtracting 14 from the current position, which gives us:\n   - \\(1 - 14 = -13\\)\n   - Since the path is circular and has 20 dots, we need to adjust for negative positions by adding 20 until we get a positive number within the range of 1 to 20:\n   - \\(-13 + 20 = 7\\)\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 17 steps in a clockwise direction.
