Since there are 20 items in total and we start at the top with a hard disk drive, we can number the positions from 1 to 20 starting with the hard disk drive at position 1.\n\nThe positions will be as follows:\n- Hard Disk Drive: 1\n- Acoustic Guitar: 2\n- Monarch Butterfly: 3\n- Daisy: 4\n- Macaque: 5\n- French Bulldog: 6\n- Tricycle: 7\n- Tusker (African bush elephant): 8\n- Box Turtle: 9\n- Running Shoe: 10\n- Badger: 11\n- Lakeland Terrier: 12\n- Plow: 13\n- Radiator: 14\n- Limousine: 15\n- Tiger Beetle: 16\n- Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake: 17\n- Baseball Player: 18\n- Piggy Bank: 19\n- Hard Disk Drive: 20 (since it's a circle)\n\nStarting from the African bush elephant (Tusker), which is at position 8, you move counter-clockwise by 6 steps. Moving counter-clockwise means we subtract the number of steps from the current position. So, 8 - 6 = 2. The item at position 2 is an acoustic guitar.\n\nNext, you move counter-clockwise by an additional 14 steps from the current position (position 2). Subtracting 14 from 2 gives us -12. Since we are in a circular path with 20 items, when we get a negative number, we add 20 to wrap around the circle. So, -12 + 20 = 8.
