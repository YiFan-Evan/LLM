Starting at the grey whale (position 3), after moving 1 step clockwise, you land at the lens cap (position 4).\n2. From the lens cap (position 4), after moving 3 more steps clockwise, you land at the solar thermal collector (position 7).\n3. From the solar thermal collector (position 7), after moving 8 more steps clockwise, you land at the notebook computer (position 3). However, since the path is circular and only has 10 positions, we need to adjust for the wrap-around. To do this, we take the total number of steps (8) and divide it by the total number of positions (10). The remainder tells us how many positions over we go past the end of the circle. In this case, 8 % 10 = 8, so we go 8 positions over from position 7, landing at position 3 again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Notebook computer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
