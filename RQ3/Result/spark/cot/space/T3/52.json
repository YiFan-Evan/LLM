Since there are only 10 elements, we take the remainder when dividing by 10: 17 % 10 = 7. This lands us on the Hummingbird.\n\n- **Step 2**: Now starting from the Hummingbird (7th element).\n  - Move 9 steps clockwise: 7 + 9 = 16. Again, taking the remainder: 16 % 10 = 6. This lands us on the Freight Car.\n\n- **Step 3**: Now starting from the Freight Car (6th element).\n  - Move 6 steps clockwise: 6 + 6 = 12. Taking the remainder: 12 % 10 = 2.
