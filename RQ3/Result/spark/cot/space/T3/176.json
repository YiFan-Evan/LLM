Turnstile\n\nWe are starting at the football helmet, which is the 3rd dot on the circle.\n\nFirst, we move 15 steps counter-clockwise:\n- Starting at the football helmet (position 3), 15 steps counter-clockwise would mean moving backwards from position 3.\n- Since we are moving counter-clockwise, subtract 15 from 3: \\(3 - 15 = -12\\). To convert this into a positive number within the range of 1 to 20, add 20 to -12: \\(-12 + 20 = 8\\).\n- So, after 15 counter-clockwise steps, we land at position 8, which is the Brittany.\n\nNext, we move 8 steps counter-clockwise from the Brittany:\n- We are currently at position 8 (Brittany).\n- Move 8 steps counter-clockwise: \\(8 - 8 = 0\\). Since the positions are from 1 to 20, we need to adjust 0 back into this range: \\(0 + 20 = 20\\).\n- Therefore, after these 8 steps, we end up at position 20, which is the turnstile.\n\nFinally, we move 20 steps counter-clockwise from the turnstile:\n- We are currently at position 20 (turnstile).\n- Move 20 steps counter-clockwise: \\(20 - 20 = 0\\). Again, adjusting this for the range of 1 to 20: \\(0 + 20 = 20\\).\n- After these 20 steps, we still end up at position 20, which is the turnstile.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: turnstile."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
