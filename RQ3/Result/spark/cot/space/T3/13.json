Moving 5 steps clockwise from position 1 will take you to position 6, but since the path is circular with only 5 dots, we need to wrap around.

Jigsaw puzzle\n\nStarting from the tusker, which is at position 2, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Moving counter-clockwise means going backwards through the circle. Since there are 5 dots, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving \\( 8 \\mod 5 = 3 \\) steps counter-clockwise.\n\nFrom position 2, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise takes us to:\n\\[ 2 - 3 = -1 \\]\nSince we are using modular arithmetic and the positions are numbered from 1 to 5, we need to adjust for negative values:\n\\[ -1 + 5 = 4 \\]\nSo, after moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the tusker, you end up at position 4, where the husky is located.\n\nNext, starting from the husky at position 4, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction. Moving clockwise means going forward through the circle. Since there are 5 dots, moving 10 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving \\( 10 \\mod 5 = 0 \\) steps clockwise.\n\nHowever, since we cannot move 0 steps and still change our position, we interpret this as completing a full circle and staying at the same position. This means that after moving 10 steps clockwise from the husky, you are still at position 4 with the husky.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **husky**."}]
