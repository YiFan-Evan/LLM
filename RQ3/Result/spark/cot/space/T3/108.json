We are given 10 items placed on a circular path in clockwise order starting from the top where the ocarina is located.

Milk can\n10.

Since we are on a circular path with 10 items, we add 10 to get the equivalent positive position: -3 + 10 = 7. This means after the first movement, we end up at the 7th position, which is occupied by the dough.\n\nSecond movement: From the dough (7th position), we move 1 step counter-clockwise: 7 - 1 = 6. So, we end up at the 6th position, which is occupied by the Rottweiler.\n\nThird movement: From the Rottweiler (6th position), we move 8 steps counter-clockwise: 6 - 8 = -2.
