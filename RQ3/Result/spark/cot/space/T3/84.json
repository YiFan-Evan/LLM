Now move 10 steps clockwise from the current position (gong at position 5):\n   - Clockwise movement means moving forwards.\n   - From position 5, move forward 10 steps: 5 + 10 = 15.\n   - Since the path is circular with 10 elements, we take modulo 10: 15 % 10 = 5.\n   - The element at position 5 is still the gong.\n4.
