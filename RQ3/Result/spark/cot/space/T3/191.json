Moving counter-clockwise means subtracting from the current position. So, $7 - 14 = -7$. In modulo 20, this becomes $20 - (-7) \\mod 20 = 27 \\mod 20 = 7$. You are back to the forklift.\n4. From the forklift, you move 13 steps in a clockwise direction. Adding 13 to the current position: $7 + 13 = 20$. In modulo 20, this remains $20 \\mod 20 = 0$.
