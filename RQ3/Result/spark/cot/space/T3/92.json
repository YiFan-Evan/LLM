Therefore, after moving counter-clockwise by 5 steps, we land on the ox.\n\nThen, we move clockwise by 10 steps from where we end up:\n- From dot 2 (where the ox is), moving clockwise by 10 steps means moving forward 10 dots.

Since we are on a circular map and there are only 10 dots, moving back 10 dots from dot 7 brings us to dot (7 - 10 = -3). To convert this to a positive number within our range of 1 to 10, we add 10 to the result: -3 + 10 = 7. Therefore, after moving counter-clockwise by 10 steps, we land on the paper towel again.\n\nThen, we move clockwise by 20 steps from where we end up:\n- From dot 7 (where the paper towel is), moving clockwise by 20 steps means moving forward 20 dots. Since there are only 10 dots total, moving forward by 20 dots from dot 7 would bring us to dot (7 + 20 = 27). To find the equivalent dot within our range of 1 to 10, we take the remainder of 27 divided by 10: 27 % 10 = 7. Therefore, after moving clockwise by 20 steps, we still land on the paper towel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Paper towel."}]
