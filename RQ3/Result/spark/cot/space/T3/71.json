We'll start by numbering the positions from 1 to 10, with the dog sled being at position 1. The other items are distributed around the circle as follows:\n\n1. Dog Sled\n2. Revolver\n3. Barn\n4.

Move clockwise by 2 steps.\n\nWe'll perform these moves step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Move Counter-clockwise by 9 Steps\nSince there are only 10 positions and moving counter-clockwise by 9 steps is equivalent to moving clockwise by 1 step (because 10 - 9 = 1), we end up at position 2. At position 2, we find a revolver.\n\n### Step 2: Move Counter-clockwise by 2 Steps\nFrom position 2, moving counter-clockwise by 2 steps takes us to position 4 (since 2 - 2 = 0, and 0 + 4 = 4). At position 4, we find a red-breasted merganser.\n\n### Step 3: Move Clockwise by 2 Steps\nFrom position 4, moving clockwise by 2 steps takes us to position 6 (since 4 + 2 = 6).
