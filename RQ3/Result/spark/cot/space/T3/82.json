Move clockwise by 1 step from the worm snake:\n   Clockwise means moving forwards. So, 1 step forward from the worm snake (item 7) would be:\n   7 + 1 = 8\n   This lands you on item 8, which is the kit fox.\n\n3. Move clockwise by 2 steps from the kit fox:\n   Again, moving forwards from the kit fox (item 8):\n   8 + 2 = 10\n   Since there are only 10 items and we reached the end, it wraps around to the beginning:\n   10 - 10 = 0 + 1 = 1\n   This lands you on item 1, which is the tool kit.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: tool kit."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
