Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point:** You start at the shoe store.\n2. **First Movement:** Move 19 steps counter-clockwise from the shoe store.\n3. **Second Movement:** Move 10 steps clockwise from the new position.\n4. **Third Movement:** Move 9 steps clockwise from the current position.\n\nLet's identify the positions step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the starting point (shoe store)\nThe items on the path are listed in a specific order. We need to find the index of the shoe store in this list. From the given sequence:\npoke bonnet, husky, cheeseburger, goose, mitten, Bloodhound, desktop computer, Toy Poodle, boa constrictor, dust jacket, honeycomb, damselfly, shoe store, hartebeest, bulbul, water buffalo, freight car, semi-trailer truck, St. Bernard, pirate ship.\n\nThe shoe store is the 13th item in this sequence.\n\n### Step 2: First Movement - 19 steps counter-clockwise\nMoving 19 steps counter-clockwise from the shoe store means we move backwards 19 positions in the circle. Since there are 20 items, we calculate the new position as follows:\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = (13 - 19) \\% 20 + 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = (-6) \\% 20 + 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = 14 \\]\n\nSo, after moving 19 steps counter-clockwise from the shoe store, you land on the 14th item. The 14th item is the **hartebeest**.\n\n### Step 3: Second Movement - 10 steps clockwise\nNow, moving 10 steps clockwise from the hartebeest:\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = (14 + 10) \\% 20 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = 24 \\% 20 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, after moving 10 steps clockwise from the hartebeest, you land on the 4th item. The 4th item is the **goose**.\n\n### Step 4: Third Movement - 9 steps clockwise\nFinally, moving 9 steps clockwise from the goose:\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = (4 + 9) \\% 20 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = 13 \\]\n\nSo, after moving 9 steps clockwise from the goose, you land on the 13th item.
