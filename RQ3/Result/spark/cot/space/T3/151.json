Since the path is circular with 20 items, moving 18 steps counter-clockwise means you are effectively moving 2 steps clockwise (20 - 18 = 2). Therefore, from the umbrella, you go clockwise to items 7 and 8, which are doormat and megalith respectively.\n\nNext, you move counter-clockwise by 2 steps from the megalith (item 8). Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from item 8 brings you to item 6 (Umbrella) and then to item 5 (Carolina anole).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Carolina anole**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

First, move counter-clockwise by 36 steps.\n2. Then, move counter-clockwise by an additional 4 steps.\n\nSince the path is circular with 20 items, moving 36 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 16 steps clockwise (because 36 - 20 = 16). From item 6 (Umbrella), moving 16 steps clockwise brings you to item 22. Since there are only 20 items, we calculate the actual position by taking modulo 20:\n22 % 20 = 2.\nSo, you land on item 2, which is a desk.\n\nNow, from the desk (item 2), you move an additional 4 steps counter-clockwise. This means moving 4 steps clockwise because moving counter-clockwise and then clockwise effectively cancels out the direction change. From item 2, moving 4 steps clockwise brings you to item 6 (Umbrella) again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Umbrella**."}]
