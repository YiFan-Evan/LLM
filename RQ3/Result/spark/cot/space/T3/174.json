Starting from the crate, we'll apply each move in sequence and determine the final position.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: You start at the crate (item number 15).\n2. **First Movement**: Move 16 steps clockwise. Since there are only 20 items, moving 16 steps around a circle of 20 brings you to item number \\(15 + 16 \\equiv 4 \\mod{20}\\) (where \\( \\equiv \\) denotes congruence modulo 20). So, after moving 16 steps, you are at item number 4, which is the rock crab.\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 19 steps counter-clockwise. Moving 19 steps counter-clockwise from item 4 would normally be \\(4 - 19 = -15\\). However, since we're on a circular path, we add 20 to make it non-negative: \\(-15 + 20 = 5\\). So, after this movement, you are at item number 5, which is the indigo bunting.\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 13 steps counter-clockwise. From item 5, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise results in \\(5 - 13 = -8\\). Again adding 20 to make it non-negative: \\(-8 + 20 = 12\\).
