This takes you to item \\(12 + 16 = 28\\). Since there are only 20 items, we find your new position by calculating \\(28 \\mod 20 = 8\\). Therefore, you move to the cello.\n- Next, move by 18 steps in a clockwise direction from the cello (item 8). This takes you to item \\(8 + 18 = 26\\). Again, using modulo operation, \\(26 \\mod 20 = 6\\). So, you move to the pedestal.\n- Then, move by 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the pedestal (item 6). This takes you to item \\(6 + 5 = 11\\). No need for modulo here as it is within the range of 20. You move to the wombat.\n- Finally, move by 16 steps in a clockwise direction from the wombat (item 11). This takes you to item \\(11 + 16 = 27\\). Using modulo operation, \\(27 \\mod 20 = 7\\). You move to the combination lock.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: combination lock."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
