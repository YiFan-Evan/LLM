Since there are 20 dots on the circular path and you move counter-clockwise, we can calculate the new position as follows:\n   - Starting at the snow leopard (6th dot), moving 9 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 9 from 6: 6 - 9 = -3.\n   - To convert this into a positive position within the 20 dots, add 20 to -3: -3 + 20 = 17.\n   - Therefore, after the first movement, you end up at the 17th dot, which is the desk.\n3. **Second Movement**: Move clockwise by 3 steps from the desk.\n   - From the 17th dot, moving 3 steps clockwise means adding 3 to 17: 17 + 3 = 20.\n   - Since it's a circular path with 20 dots, the 20th dot wraps around to the 1st dot.\n   - Therefore, after the second movement, you end up at the 1st dot, which is the hornbill.\n4. **Third Movement**: Move counter-clockwise by 7 steps from the hornbill.\n   - Starting at the 1st dot, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise means subtracting 7 from 1: 1 - 7 = -6.\n   - Adding 20 to -6 to keep it within the range: -6 + 20 = 14.\n   - Therefore, after the third movement, you end up at the 14th dot, which is the violin.\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Move clockwise by 6 steps from the violin.\n   - From the 14th dot, moving 6 steps clockwise means adding 6 to 14: 14 + 6 = 20.\n   - Since it's a circular path with 20 dots, the 20th dot wraps around to the 1st dot again.\n   - Therefore, after the fourth movement, you end up at the 1st dot again, which is still the hornbill.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **hornbill**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
