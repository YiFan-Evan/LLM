We start at the hartebeest and move counter-clockwise by 3 steps, then clockwise by 16 steps, and finally clockwise by 7 steps.\n\n1. **Starting Point:** The hartebeest is located at position 1 (since it's at the top).\n2. **First Movement:** Move counter-clockwise by 3 steps. Since moving counter-clockwise reduces the position number, we subtract 3 from the starting point:\n   - Position = 1 - 3 = -2 (This can be converted to a positive equivalent by adding 20 to make it within the range of 1 to 20: -2 + 20 = 18)\n3. **Second Movement:** Move clockwise by 16 steps. Clockwise movement increases the position number, so we add 16:\n   - Position = 18 + 16 = 34 (Since the path has only 20 dots, we find the equivalent position within the range by taking modulo 20: 34 % 20 = 14)\n4. **Third Movement:** Move clockwise by 7 steps. Again, we add 7:\n   - Position = 14 + 7 = 21 (Taking modulo 20: 21 % 20 = 1)\n\nAfter all these movements, we end up at position 1 on the circular path.
