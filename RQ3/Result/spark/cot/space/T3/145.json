From position 11, move back 8 steps:\n\\[ 11 - 8 = 3 \\]\nSo, you land on the **Ear**.\n\n### Step 3: Move 26 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Ear:\nFrom position 3, move back 26 steps:\n\\[ 3 - 26 = -23 \\]\nSince moving counter-clockwise can wrap around the circle, we add 20 until we get a positive number within the range:\n\\[ -23 + 20 = -3 \\]\n\\[ -3 + 20 = 17 \\]\nSo, you land on the **Sea urchin**.\n\n### Step 4: Move 8 steps in a clockwise direction from the Sea urchin:\nFrom position 17, move forward 8 steps:\n\\[ 17 + 8 = 25 \\]\n\\[ 25 \\mod 20 = 5 \\]\nSo, you land on the **Monastery**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Monastery**."}]
