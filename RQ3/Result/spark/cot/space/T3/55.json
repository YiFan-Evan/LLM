Since moving counter-clockwise means going backwards, wrap around if necessary. Here, it lands us back at position 1 (Odometer).\n   - After second move (4 steps counter-clockwise):\n     - From position 1, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise: \\(1 - 4 = -3\\).

So, the new position is 7 (Barn spider).\n   - After third move (9 steps clockwise):\n     - From position 7, moving 9 steps clockwise: \\(7 + 9 = 16\\).
