Let's number the items on the path starting from the vine snake as 1:\n\n1. Vine Snake\n2. Beaker\n3. Mitten\n4. Boathouse\n5. Obelisk\n6. Alligator Lizard\n7. Night Snake\n8. Pug\n9. Staffordshire Bull Terrier\n10. Angora Rabbit\n\nNow, let's follow your movements step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: You start at the obelisk (item 5).\n2. **First Move**: Move 10 steps counter-clockwise from the obelisk.\n   - Since there are only 10 items in total, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from item 5 brings you back to item 5 (the obelisk).\n3. **Second Move**: Move 2 steps counter-clockwise from the obelisk.\n   - Moving 2 steps back from item 5, you land at item 3 (the boathouse).\n4. **Third Move**: Move 20 steps clockwise from the boathouse.\n   - Moving 20 steps forward from item 3, since the path is circular and has 10 items, we calculate the effective movement:\n     \\[\n     20 \\mod 10 = 0\n     \\]\n   - This means you move a complete circle and end up back at item 3 (the boathouse).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Boathouse**."}]
