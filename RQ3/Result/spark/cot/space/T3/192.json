Now, starting from the mailbox (position 6):\n   - Moving 18 steps in a clockwise direction:\n     - 6 + 18 = 24\n     - Again, take modulo 20 of 24:\n     - 24 % 20 = 4\n     - The item at position 4 is a zucchini.\n\n3. Now, starting from the zucchini (position 4):\n   - Moving 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction:\n     - Since counter-clockwise movement means going backwards on the circle, we subtract from 20:\n     - 4 - 14 = -10\n     - Adding 20 to make it within the range of the circle:\n     - -10 + 20 = 10\n     - The item at position 10 is a wild boar.\n\n4.
