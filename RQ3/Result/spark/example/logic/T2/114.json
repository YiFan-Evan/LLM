[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Sam is a vumpus and a sterpus and a lempus.\n14. Sam is a rompus.\n\nWe need to prove:\n15. Sam is not a tumpus.\n\nFrom premise (11), we know that Sam is a numpus. Since numpuses are lorpuses according to premise (10), Sam is also a lorpus. However, this does not directly relate to whether Sam is a tumpus or not.\n\nNext, let's consider the conditions for being a wumpus. According to premise (8), everything that is a tumpus, a yumpus, and a rompus is a wumpus. We know from premises (12) and (14) that Sam is both a yumpus and a rompus. Therefore, Sam must be a wumpus due to premise (8). This is consistent with premise (1).\n\nNow, let's consider the conditions for being a vumpus. According to premise (4), everything that is a wumpus, a tumpus, and a lempus is a vumpus. We already know from premises (1), (5), and (7) that Sam is a wumpus, a lempus, and a tumpus. Therefore, Sam must be a vumpus due to premise (4). This is consistent with premise (13).\n\nSince Sam is a vumpus, and being a vumpus implies being a wumpus, a lempus, and a tumpus according to premise (4), it seems that Sam cannot be not a tumpus without contradicting the definition of being a vumpus.\n\nHowever, there is a contradiction in the premises themselves. Premise (7) states that Sam is a tumpus, while we are trying to prove that Sam is not a tumpus. This means that our proof obligation contradicts one of the given premises.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot prove that Sam is not a tumpus because it directly contradicts the information provided in premise (7).
