Let's break down the relevant premises:\n\n1. Every mother has a son. (This premise seems unrelated to the others and does not contribute to proving the final statement.)\n2. Everything that is a jompus or a gorpus or a lempus is a vumpus.\n3. Everything that is a rompus or a gorpus or a zumpus is a shumpus.\n4. Lempuses are zumpuses.\n5. Each yumpus is a shumpus.\n6.

Alex is a sterpus.\n\nWe are trying to prove:\n12. Alex is a jompus.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the information given about Alex:\n- Alex is a sterpus (Premise 11).\n- Every sterpus is a lempus, a yumpus, and a gorpus (Premise 7).\n\nFrom Premise 7, since Alex is a sterpus, we can infer that Alex is also a lempus, a yumpus, and a gorpus.\n\nNow, let's see what these implications mean according to the other premises:\n- Since Alex is a lempus (from being a sterpus), and all lempuses are zumpuses (Premise 4), then Alex is also a zumpus.\n- Since Alex is a yumpus (from being a sterpus), and each yumpus is a shumpus (Premise 5), then Alex is also a shumpus. This matches with Premise 10, which we already know.\n- Since Alex is a gorpus (from being a sterpus), and everything that is a jompus or a gorpus or a lempus is a vumpus (Premise 2), then Alex is also a vumpus.\n\nNow, we have established that Alex is a vumpus. The next step is to connect this to being a jompus:\n- Since Alex is a vumpus, and all vumpuses are jompuses (Premise 9), then it follows that Alex is a jompus.\n\nTherefore, by combining the relevant premises and applying logical deduction, we have proven that:\nAlex is a jompus."}]
