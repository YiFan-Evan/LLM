Mark each neighbor as visited and record the path taken to reach it.\n3. **Repeat**: Continue exploring until you either find the destination node (node 22) or exhaust all possible paths.\n4. **Backtrack**: Once the destination is found, backtrack using the recorded paths to construct the shortest path.\n\nHere's the Python code to implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Initialize the queue with the starting node and a list to keep track of the path\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue a node and its path\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If the current node is the goal, return the path\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Get neighbors of the current node\n        neighbors = [edge[1] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[0] == current_node] + \\\n                    [edge[0] for edge in graph['edges'] if edge[1] == current_node]\n        \n        # Enqueue unvisited neighbors with updated path\n        for neighbor in neighbors:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n    \n    # Return None if there is no path from start to goal\n    return None\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 20], [0, 21], [1, 8], [1, 17], [2, 9], [2, 13], [2, 23], [2, 10], [3, 11], [4, 12], [5, 17], [5, 24], [6, 11], [7, 18], [8, 21], [10, 22], [10, 24], [11, 24], [12, 18], [12, 24], [14, 17], [15, 22], [16, 18], [18, 19]]\n}\n\n# Find the shortest path from node 5 to node 22\nstart_node = 5\ndestination_node = 22\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the shortest path from node 5 to node 22.
