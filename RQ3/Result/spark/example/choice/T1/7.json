The term \"enviro-ethical\" implies that their decision is influenced by a desire to make choices that are environmentally responsible or sustainable.\n\nGiven this context, the most logical option that aligns with their values would be:\n\nB. biological child\n\nThis is because having a biological child typically has a larger environmental impact compared to adopting a child who already exists. Adoption can be seen as a more sustainable choice since it does not contribute to overpopulation and often requires fewer resources than raising a newborn."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The family wanted to adopt for enviro-ethical reasons, what did they abhor?\nOptions: E. abandon D. foster child C. give away B. biological child A. orphan"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "B. biological child"}]
