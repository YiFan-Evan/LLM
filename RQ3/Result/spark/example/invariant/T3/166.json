This is because the first element is considered to be already sorted.\n2. **Key Selection**: For each iteration, the current element `arr[i]` is stored in the variable `key`.\n3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares the `key` with elements before it (starting from the element just before the `key`). If an element is greater than the `key`, it shifts that element one position to the right.\n4. **Insertion**: Once the correct position for the `key` is found (when either the start of the array is reached or an element less than or equal to the `key` is found), the `key` is inserted into its correct position.\n5. **Return**: Finally, the sorted array is returned.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\narr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order by repeatedly placing each element in its correct position relative to the already sorted portion of the array."}]
