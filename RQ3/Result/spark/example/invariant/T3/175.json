Here's a corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n1. The outer loop should start from the second element (index 1) and go up to the last element.\n2. The inner loop should compare the current element with the previous elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order.\n3. The variable `i` is not defined; it should be replaced with `p`.\n4. The condition for the inner loop should be `z > 0` instead of `z < len(arr)`.\n5. The decrement of `p` should be done at the end of the outer loop, not at the beginning.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for p in range(1, len(arr)):\n        z = p\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly sorts an array using the insertion sort algorithm. Let's break down how it works:\n\n- The outer loop starts from the second element (index 1) and goes through each element of the array.\n- For each element, the inner loop checks if it is smaller than the previous elements. If it is, it swaps the elements until the current element is in its correct position.\n- This process continues until the entire array is sorted."}]
