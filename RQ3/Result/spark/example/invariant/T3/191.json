For each position `i`, we assume that the element at `i` is the minimum.\n2. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop starts from `i + 1` and goes to the end of the array. It finds the index of the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array.\n3. **Swapping**: After finding the smallest element in the unsorted portion, it swaps this element with the element at position `i`.\n4. **Return**: Finally, the sorted array is returned.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\narr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\nsorted_arr = selection_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\n```\n\nThis implementation correctly sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm."}]
