[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Specifically, the variable `i` is not defined, and the inner loop should start from `n` instead of `z`. Here's a corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = 1  # Start from the second element\n    while n < len(arr):\n        z = n\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            # Swap elements\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        n += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the corrected code:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The outer loop starts with `n` set to 1 because the first element (at index 0) is considered sorted by itself.\n2. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares the current element (`arr[n]`) with its predecessor (`arr[n-1]`). If the predecessor is greater, they are swapped. This process continues until the current element is in its correct position or the beginning of the array is reached.\n3. **Increment**: After each pass through the inner loop, `n` is incremented to move to the next element in the array.\n4. **Return**: Once all elements have been processed, the sorted array is returned.\n\nYou can test this function with an example list to see if it sorts correctly:\n\n```python\nexample_list = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\nsorted_list = insertion_sort(example_list)\nprint(sorted_list)  # Output should be [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        n -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code for the insertion sort algorithm contains a few errors and inefficiencies. Here's a corrected version of the insertion sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Initialization**: The outer loop starts from `i = 1` because the first element is considered sorted by itself.\n2. **Key Selection**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the current element (`arr[i]`) is stored in `key`.\n3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares the `key` with elements before it (`arr[j]`). If `arr[j]` is greater than `key`, it shifts `arr[j]` to the right.\n4. **Insertion**: Once the correct position for `key` is found, it is inserted into the array.\n5. **Return**: Finally, the sorted array is returned.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\nexample_list = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\nsorted_list = insertion_sort(example_list)\nprint(sorted_list)  # Output should be [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the list is sorted correctly using the insertion sort algorithm."}]
