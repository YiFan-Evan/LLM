This is because the first element is considered already sorted.\n2. **Key Element**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the current element (`key`) is stored.\n3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares the `key` with elements before it (those that are already sorted). It shifts elements that are greater than the `key` one position to the right.\n4. **Insertion**: Once the correct position for the `key` is found (when `arr[j] <= key`), the `key` is inserted at that position.\n5. **Return**: Finally, the sorted array is returned.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm."}]
