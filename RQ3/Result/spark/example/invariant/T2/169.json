The outer loop starts from the second element (index 1) and iterates through each element of the array.\n2. For each element at index `j`, we store its value in the variable `key`.\n3. We then initialize `z` to `j - 1`, which is the index of the previous element.\n4. The inner loop shifts elements that are greater than `key` one position to the right.\n5. When the correct position for `key` is found (when `arr[z] <= key` or `z < 0`), we insert `key` into its correct position.\n6. Finally, the sorted array is returned.\n\nThis implementation ensures that each element is placed in its correct position relative to the already sorted portion of the array."}]
