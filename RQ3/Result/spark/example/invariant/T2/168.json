Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the insertion sort works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The outer loop starts with `i = 0` and iterates through each element in the array.\n2. **Inner Loop**: For each element at index `i`, the inner loop compares it with the elements before it (i.e., elements at indices `0` to `i-1`).\n3. **Swapping**: If an element at index `z` is found to be smaller than the element at index `z-1`, they are swapped. This process continues until the correct position for the element at index `i` is found.\n4. **Increment**: After placing the current element in its correct position, the outer loop increments `i` and repeats the process for the next element.\n\nHere's the code again with comments for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            # Swap elements if they are in the wrong order\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output will be [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case (when the array is sorted in reverse order), but can be O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).\n- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since it sorts the array in place without requiring additional storage.\n- **Stability**: The algorithm is stable; equal elements retain their relative order.\n\nThis implementation is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted data."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        i += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code is an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm. Insertion sort works by iterating through the array and inserting each element into its correct position relative to the already sorted portion of the array.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The variable `i` is initialized to -1. This will be used to keep track of the current index being processed in the outer loop.\n2. **Outer Loop**: The outer `while` loop runs as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. This ensures that all elements are processed.\n3. **Increment Index**: Inside the outer loop, `i` is incremented by 1 to move to the next element.\n4. **Inner Loop**: The inner `while` loop checks if the current element (at index `z`, which starts at `i`) is smaller than the previous element (at index `z - 1`). If so, it swaps them.\n5. **Swapping**: The elements are swapped using a temporary variable `temp`.\n6. **Decrement Index**: After swapping, `z` is decremented by 1 to continue comparing and swapping with the previous elements until the correct position for the current element is found.\n7. **Return**: Once the entire array is processed, the sorted array is returned.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        i += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case (when the array is sorted in reverse order), but can be O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).\n- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since it sorts the array in place without requiring additional storage.\n- **Stability**: The algorithm is stable; equal elements retain their relative order."}]
