This is because the first element is considered already sorted.\n\n2. **Key Selection**: For each iteration of the outer loop, the `key` variable is set to the current element that needs to be placed in its correct position relative to the previously sorted elements.\n\n3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares the `key` with the elements before it (those that are already sorted). It shifts elements one position to the right until it finds the correct position for the `key`.\n\n4. **Insertion**: Once the correct position is found, the `key` is inserted into that position.\n\n5. **Return**: After all elements have been processed, the sorted array is returned.\n\nThis implementation ensures that each element is compared and placed correctly, resulting in a sorted array."}]
