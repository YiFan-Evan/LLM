Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the insertion sort works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The outer loop starts with `i = 0` and iterates through each element in the array.\n2. **Inner Loop**: For each element at index `i`, the inner loop compares it with the elements before it (i.e., elements at indices `0` to `i-1`).\n3. **Swapping**: If an element at index `z` is smaller than the element at index `z-1`, they are swapped. This process continues until the correct position for the element at index `i` is found.\n4. **Increment**: The outer loop increments `i` and repeats the process until all elements have been considered.\n\nHere's the code again with comments for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            # Swap elements if they are in the wrong order\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output will be [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case (when the array is sorted in reverse order), but can be O(n) in the best case (when the array is already sorted).\n- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since it sorts the array in place without requiring additional storage.\n- **Stability**: The algorithm is stable; equal elements retain their relative order.\n\nThis implementation is straightforward and easy to understand, making it suitable for small datasets or nearly sorted data."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your implementation of the insertion sort algorithm is correct. The function `insertion_sort` sorts an array in ascending order using the insertion sort technique. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the first element (index 0) and assume it is sorted.\n2. **Outer Loop**: Iterate through each element of the array starting from the second element (index 1).\n3. **Inner Loop**: For each element, compare it with the elements before it (to its left) and shift them to the right if they are greater than the current element.\n4. **Swapping**: Swap the current element with the previous element until the correct position for the current element is found.\n5. **Increment**: Move to the next element and repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.\n\nHere's your code with some comments for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:  # Outer loop to go through each element\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:  # Inner loop to shift elements to the right\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1  # Move to the previous element\n        i += 1  # Move to the next element\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\narr = [5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output will be [1, 2, 5, 5, 6, 9]\n```\n\nThis function will correctly sort the input array in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm."}]
