Specifically, the variable `i` is not defined, and the outer loop should start from `j = 1` instead of `j = 0` to correctly implement the insertion sort logic.

The outer loop starts at index `1` because the first element is considered sorted by itself.\n2. For each element at index `j`, we store its value in `z`.\n3. The inner loop checks if the previous element (`arr[z - 1]`) is greater than the current element (`arr[z]`). If it is, they are swapped.\n4. This process continues until the correct position for `arr[j]` is found, ensuring that all elements before `j` are sorted.\n5. The array is returned once all elements have been processed.\n\nYou can test this function with an example list to see how it sorts the elements:\n\n```python\nexample_list = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]\nsorted_list = insertion_sort(example_list)\nprint(sorted_list)  # Output should be [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]\n```"}]
