[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

However, it contains a mistake that prevents it from working correctly. The issue lies in the swapping logic inside the nested while loop.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the selection sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c < len(arr):\n        z = c + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[c]:\n                # Swap elements at index c and z\n                temp = arr[c]\n                arr[c] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        c += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\nThis function sorts an array `arr` in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Iterate over each element in the array with the outer loop (`while c < len(arr)`).\n2. For each element at index `c`, find the smallest element in the remaining part of the array (from index `c+1` to the end) using the inner loop (`while z < len(arr)`).\n3. If a smaller element is found, swap it with the element at index `c`.\n4. Continue this process until the entire array is sorted.\n\nLet's test the function with an example:\n\n```python\narr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\nsorted_arr = selection_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output should be [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\n```\n\nThis will correctly sort the array in ascending order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = c + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[c]:\n                temp = arr[c]\n                arr[c] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        c += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code is an implementation of the selection sort algorithm. However, it contains a logical error that prevents it from correctly sorting the array. The issue lies in the swapping logic inside the nested while loop.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the selection sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c < len(arr) - 1:\n        min_index = c\n        z = c + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = z\n            z += 1\n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element\n        arr[c], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[c]\n        c += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Outer Loop (`while c < len(arr) - 1`)**: This loop runs through each element of the array except the last one since, by the time we reach the second-to-last element, the array will already be sorted.\n2. **Inner Loop (`while z < len(arr)`)**: This loop finds the index of the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array.\n3. **Swapping**: After finding the smallest element in the unsorted portion, it swaps this element with the first element of the unsorted portion.\n4. **Increment `c`**: Move to the next position in the array and repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.\n\n### Example Usage:\n```python\narr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]\nsorted_arr = selection_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # Output should be [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]\n```\n\nThis corrected implementation ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm."}]
