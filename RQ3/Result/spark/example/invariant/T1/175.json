Specifically, the variable `i` is not defined, and the outer loop should start from index 1 instead of 0 to properly implement the insertion sort algorithm. Here's the corrected version:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    # Start from the second element (index 1)\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key,\n        # to one position ahead of their current position\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop starts from the second element (index 1) because the first element is already considered sorted.\n2. **Key Element**: For each iteration, the `key` is set to the current element `arr[i]`.\n3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares the `key` with elements before it (`arr[j]`). If an element is greater than the `key`, it shifts that element one position to the right.\n4. **Insert Key**: Once the correct position for the `key` is found, it is inserted into its correct position.\n\nThis implementation ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order by repeatedly placing each element in its correct position relative to the already sorted portion of the array."}]
