Specifically, the variable `i` is not defined, and the outer loop should start from index 1 instead of 0 to properly implement the insertion sort logic. Here's the corrected version of the insertion sort function:\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    # Start from the second element (index 1)\n    for k in range(1, len(arr)):\n        z = k\n        # Move elements of arr[0..k-1], that are greater than key, to one position ahead of their current position\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            # Swap arr[z] and arr[z - 1]\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop starts at index 1 because the first element is considered sorted by itself.\n2. **Inner Loop**: This loop compares the current element (`arr[z]`) with its predecessor (`arr[z - 1]`). If the predecessor is greater, they are swapped. This process continues until the correct position for the current element is found or the beginning of the array is reached.\n3. **Swapping**: When a swap is needed, the elements are temporarily stored in `temp`, then swapped.\n\nThis implementation ensures that each element is placed in its correct position relative to the already sorted portion of the array."}]
