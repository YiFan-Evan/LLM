[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting x=4 into this result gives:\n\nln|4| + C = ln(4) + C = 2*ln(2) + C.\n\nSince we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we consider only the integer part of ln(2), which is approximately 0.69314718056. Therefore, the final result is:\n\n0 + C = C (since ln(2) is less than 1 and will be rounded down to 0).\n\nThus, the integer result is:\n\nC"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function (1/x) + x is ln|x| + (1/2)*x^2 + C, where C is the constant of integration.
