[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Compute the indefinite integral of the function \\( e^{\\cos(x)} + x \\).\n2. Substitute \\( x = 4 \\) into the result of the indefinite integral.\n3. Round down to the nearest integer.\n\n### Step 1: Compute the Indefinite Integral\n\nThe function is \\( f(x) = e^{\\cos(x)} + x \\). We need to find the indefinite integral:\n\n\\[\n\\int (e^{\\cos(x)} + x) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nThis can be split into two separate integrals:\n\n\\[\n\\int e^{\\cos(x)} \\, dx + \\int x \\, dx\n\\]\n\n#### Integral of \\( e^{\\cos(x)} \\):\n\nLet's use substitution for the first part. Let \\( u = \\cos(x) \\), then \\( du = -\\sin(x) \\, dx \\), or equivalently, \\( dx = -\\frac{du}{\\sin(x)} \\). However, this substitution does not simplify the integral in a useful way because there is no \\( \\sin(x) \\) term to cancel out the \\( dx \\) term. Therefore, we recognize that \\( e^{\\cos(x)} \\) does not have an elementary antiderivative. We will denote its integral as \\( \\int e^{\\cos(x)} \\, dx = F(x) \\), where \\( F(x) \\) is some antiderivative of \\( e^{\\cos(x)} \\).\n\n#### Integral of \\( x \\):\n\nThe integral of \\( x \\) is straightforward:\n\n\\[\n\\int x \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C_1\n\\]\n\nCombining these results, the indefinite integral is:\n\n\\[\n\\int (e^{\\cos(x)} + x) \\, dx = F(x) + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( F(x) \\) is the antiderivative of \\( e^{\\cos(x)} \\) and \\( C \\) is the constant of integration.\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 4 \\)\n\nNow we substitute \\( x = 4 \\) into the result of the indefinite integral:\n\n\\[\nF(4) + \\frac{4^2}{2} + C = F(4) + 8 + C\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Round Down to the Nearest Integer\n\nSince \\( F(x) \\) is some unknown function representing the antiderivative of \\( e^{\\cos(x)} \\), we cannot compute \\( F(4) \\) exactly. However, for the purpose of rounding down, we note that the exponential function \\( e^{\\cos(x)} \\) is always positive and bounded between \\( e^{-1} \\) and \\( e^1 \\). Thus, \\( F(4) \\) will be some finite value.\n\nAssuming \\( F(4) \\) is finite and positive, the dominant term in our expression will be the constant 8. Therefore, the entire expression \\( F(4) + 8 + C \\) will be slightly more than 8 (assuming \\( C \\) is small compared to 8).\n\nRounding down any number slightly more than 8 gives us:\n\n\\[\n8\n\\]"}]
