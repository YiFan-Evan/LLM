[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. Rewrite the function as (1+x) * x^2 = x^3 + x^2.\n\n2. Integrate each term separately:\n   - The integral of x^3 is \u222bx^3 dx = (1/4)x^4 + C.\n   - The integral of x^2 is \u222bx^2 dx = (1/3)x^3 + C.\n\n3. Add the two integrals together:\n   - (1/4)x^4 + (1/3)x^3 + C.\n\n4.
