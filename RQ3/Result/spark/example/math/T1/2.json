[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function (1+x) is:\n\nx + 0.5*x^2 + C\n\nSubstituting x=4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\n\n4 + 0.5*(4)^2 + C = 4 + 8 + C = 12 + C\n\nRounding down, we get:\n\n12"}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function $1+x$ is:\n\n$$ x + \\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C $$\n\nSubstituting $x=4$ into the result of the indefinite integral, we get:\n\n$$ 4 + \\frac{1}{2}(4)^2 + C = 4 + 8 + C = 12 + C $$\n\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\n\n$$ \\lfloor 12 + C \\rfloor $$\n\nSince $C$ is the constant of integration, it can be any real number. However, since we are rounding down, the smallest possible value for $C$ that would change the integer part of the result is 1. Therefore, if $C < 1$, the rounded down result remains 12. If $C \\geq 1$, then the rounded down result would be 13 or more. But since we need a single integer number as the final result, we take the smallest possible value when rounding down, which is 12."}]
