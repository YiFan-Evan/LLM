[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sin(x)/x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1"}, {"role": "user", "content": "sin(x)/x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve the problem, we need to find the indefinite integral of the function \\(\\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}\\), which is known as the Sine Integral, denoted as \\(\\text{Si}(x)\\).
