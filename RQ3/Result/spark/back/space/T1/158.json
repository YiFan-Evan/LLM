The key is to understand how these movements affect your position relative to the starting point.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Starting Point\nThe starting item is the gas pump. This is our reference point.\n\n### Step 2: Convert Movements into Net Movements\nWe need to convert all movements into a single net movement around the circle. Here are the steps:\n\n1. **Move 19 steps counter-clockwise**:\n   - Since moving counter-clockwise means going backward, 19 steps back from the gas pump.\n   - Position after this move = (20 - 19) % 20 = 1 step before the gas pump.\n   \n2. **Move 15 steps clockwise**:\n   - From the current position (1 step before the gas pump), move 15 steps forward.\n   - Position after this move = (1 + 15) % 20 = 16 steps ahead of the gas pump.\n   \n3. **Move 12 steps clockwise**:\n   - From the current position (16 steps ahead of the gas pump), move 12 steps forward.\n   - Position after this move = (16 + 12) % 20 = 28 % 20 = 8 steps ahead of the gas pump.\n   \n4. **Move 5 steps counter-clockwise**:\n   - From the current position (8 steps ahead of the gas pump), move 5 steps back.\n   - Position after this move = (8 - 5) % 20 = 3 steps ahead of the gas pump.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Final Position\nFrom the gas pump, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the item at position 3. We need to find out what item corresponds to this position.\n\n### Step 4: Map the Final Position to the Item\nStarting from the mosquito net, the items on the path are as follows:\n1. Mosquito net\n2. Grasshopper\n3. American lobster\n4. Tibetan Terrier\n5. Crash helmet\n6. Slug\n7. Duck\n8. Norwich Terrier\n9. Gas pump (starting point)\n10. Jeans\n11. White-headed capuchin\n12.
