This calculation can be done by subtracting 7 from 2 and finding the equivalent positive position within the range of 1 to 10. \\(2 - 7 = -5\\). Adding 10 to -5 gives us a position of 5 (since the circle wraps around), which corresponds to the leatherback sea turtle.\n   - Move clockwise by 9 steps: From position 5 (leatherback sea turtle), move 9 steps forward. Since there are only 10 positions, moving 9 steps from position 5 wraps around the circle and lands us at position 4 (night snake).\n   - Move counter-clockwise by 2 steps: From position 4 (night snake), move 2 steps back.
