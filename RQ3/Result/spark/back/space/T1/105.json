Oboe (start)\n2. Baseball\n3. Bell pepper\n4. Tights\n5. Christmas stocking\n6. Brass\n7. Pizza\n8. Meerkat\n9. Eastern diamondback rattlesnake\n10. Spoonbill\n\nStarting from the Christmas stocking (position 5), let's calculate each movement:\n\n1. **First Movement:** 9 steps in a clockwise direction from the Christmas stocking.\n   - To find the position after moving 9 steps from position 5, we use modulo arithmetic: \\((5 + 9 - 1) \\mod 10 = 13 \\mod 10 = 3\\). This means you land at position 3, which is the Bell pepper.\n\n2. **Second Movement:** 8 steps in a clockwise direction from the new position (Bell pepper).\n   - Now starting from position 3 (Bell pepper), move 8 steps: \\((3 + 8 - 1) \\mod 10 = 10 \\mod 10 = 0\\). Since positions are 1-indexed, subtract 1 more to get the correct position: \\(10 - 1 = 9\\). You land at position 9, which is the Eastern diamondback rattlesnake.\n\n3. **Third Movement:** 4 steps in a clockwise direction from the new position (Eastern diamondback rattlesnake).\n   - Starting from position 9 (Eastern diamondback rattlesnake), move 4 steps: \\((9 + 4 - 1) \\mod 10 = 12 \\mod 10 = 2\\).
