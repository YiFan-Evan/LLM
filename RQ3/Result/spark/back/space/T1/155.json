Starting from the top, the items are listed in a specific order.\n\n2. **Starting Point:** We begin at the prairie grouse. To locate the prairie grouse on the list, we count the items from the starting point (swimming cap) until we reach the prairie grouse. From the swimming cap, the items are: beer glass, paper towel, wing, water jug, scuba diver, artichoke, mixing bowl, alligator lizard, prairie grouse. This makes the prairie grouse the 9th item on the list.\n\n3. **Clockwise Movement:** Moving 16 steps clockwise from the prairie grouse means adding 16 to the current position modulo 20 (since there are 20 items). So, we calculate \\( (9 + 16) \\% 20 = 25 \\% 20 = 5 \\). This means that after moving 16 steps clockwise, we land on the eraser.\n\n4. **Counter-clockwise Movement:** Next, we move 17 steps counter-clockwise. Moving counter-clockwise can be thought of as moving clockwise in the opposite direction, so subtract 17 from the current position modulo 20. \\( (5 - 17) \\% 20 = -12 \\% 20 = 8 \\). This means that after moving 17 steps counter-clockwise, we land on the necklace.\n\n5. **Another Counter-clockwise Movement:** Now, we move another 5 steps counter-clockwise.

This means that after moving 5 more steps counter-clockwise, we land on the Australian Silky Terrier.\n\n6. **Final Counter-clockwise Movement:** Finally, we move 7 steps counter-clockwise. Subtracting 7 from the current position modulo 20 gives us \\( (3 - 7) \\% 20 = -4 \\% 20 = 16 \\).
