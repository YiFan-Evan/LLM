We need to find the position of the monitor in this sequence.\n\nThe sequence is as follows:\n1. Mobile Home (starting point)\n2. Italian Greyhound\n3. Speaker\n4. Confectionery Store\n5. Radiator\n6. Scooter\n7. Lab Coat\n8. European Garden Spider\n9. Bassinet\n10. Plectrum\n11. Wire Fox Terrier\n12. Pufferfish\n13. Paddle\n14. Marimba\n15. Armadillo\n16. Jellyfish\n17.
