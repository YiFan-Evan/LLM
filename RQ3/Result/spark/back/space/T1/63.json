This means that if you move past the last dot, you will return to the first dot.\n2. **Counter-Clockwise Movement**: When moving counter-clockwise, the items on the path are encountered in reverse order from what they would be if moving clockwise.\n3. **Modulo Operation**: To determine the position after a movement, use modulo arithmetic. For example, if you move \\( n \\) steps in a circle of size \\( m \\), the new position can be calculated as \\((current\\_position - n) \\mod m\\). If the result is negative, add \\( m \\) to get the correct positive position.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Identify Initial Position**: Starting from the vase, which is the sixth item on the path (church being the first).\n2. **First Movement**: Move 1 step counter-clockwise from the vase.\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 4 steps counter-clockwise from the new position.\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the new position.\n\nLet's calculate each step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Vase at position 6.\n2. **First Movement**: Move 1 step counter-clockwise: \\((6 - 1 + 10) \\mod 10 = 5\\).
