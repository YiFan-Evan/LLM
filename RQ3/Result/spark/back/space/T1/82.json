Since the path is circular with 10 elements, moving 6 steps backward from the conch (2nd dot) lands you at the 8th dot (Hot pot).\n   - Next, moving 1 step clockwise from the Hot pot moves you to the Asian elephant (9th dot).\n   - Finally, moving 2 steps clockwise from the Asian elephant takes you to the bookcase (1st dot).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Bookcase**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
