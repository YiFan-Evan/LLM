Since there are 10 elements on the path, moving 8 steps from the chiton brings us to the European garden spider (counting starts from 0 for the chiton, so 8 steps later would be position 8 modulo 10, which equals 8).\n- Next, move 4 steps in a clockwise direction from the European garden spider. This brings us to the honeycomb (starting from position 8, moving 4 steps forward gives us position 2 modulo 10, which equals 2).\n- Finally, move 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the honeycomb. Moving counter-clockwise means subtracting steps, so from position 2, subtracting 4 gives us position 8 modulo 10, which equals 8. Position 8 corresponds to the European garden spider again.\n\nTherefore, after all these movements, you will find the **European garden spider**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
