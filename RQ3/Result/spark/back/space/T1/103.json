At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a great egret. Moving in a clockwise direction from the great egret, the elements on the path are a kit fox, a Standard Schnauzer, a Curly-coated Retriever, a smooth green snake, a spoonbill, a monitor, a common squirrel monkey, a Basset Hound, and a bell pepper.

Starting from the monitor, the first step is moving 4 steps in a clockwise direction. Since the monitor is at position 7 (counting from 0 for the great egret), we add 4 to it: 7 + 4 = 11. Since the path consists of 10 dots, we calculate the new position by taking modulo 10 of the sum: 11 % 10 = 1. This means that after the first movement, you are at position 1, which corresponds to the spoonbill.\n\n2. The second movement is 2 steps in a clockwise direction from the current position (spoonbill). From position 1, adding 2 gives us: 1 + 2 = 3. Therefore, after this movement, you find yourself at position 3, where there is a smooth green snake.\n\n3. The third movement is 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction from the current position (smooth green snake).
