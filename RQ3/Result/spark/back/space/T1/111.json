We also need to comprehend how moving clockwise and counter-clockwise affects our position on the path.\n\nFirstly, let's number the dots in a clockwise direction starting from the top where the Komodo dragon is located:\n1. Komodo dragon\n2. Gown\n3. Australian Kelpie\n4. Toy store\n5. Great Dane\n6. Jack-o'-lantern\n7. Wallaby\n8. Greater Swiss Mountain Dog\n9. Curly-coated Retriever\n10. Trolleybus\n\nNow, we are given that we start at the jack-o'-lantern (which is on dot 6), and we move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, then by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nLet's calculate each movement step by step:\n1. Starting from the jack-o'-lantern (dot 6), we move 8 steps in a clockwise direction. Since there are only 10 dots, moving 8 steps from dot 6 will wrap around to dot 4 ((6 + 8) % 10 = 14 % 10 = 4). So we land on the Great Dane.\n2. Next, we move 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Great Dane (dot 4). Moving counter-clockwise means subtracting steps, but since we can't go below 1, we add 10 to any negative result and take modulo 10 again. So, (4 - 6 + 10) % 10 = 8 % 10 = 8. We land on the Curly-coated Retriever.\n3. Finally, we move 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Curly-coated Retriever (dot 8). Again, subtracting steps and adding 10 if necessary, we get (8 - 3 + 10) % 10 = 15 % 10 = 5. We land on the Toy store.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Toy store."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
