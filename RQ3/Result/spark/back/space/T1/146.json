Mathematically, this means adding the number of steps moved to the initial position and then taking this sum modulo the total number of dots (or items) on the path to find the final position.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Starting from the oxygen mask, which is the second item on the path.\n\n2. **First Movement**: Moving clockwise by 8 steps from the oxygen mask. Since the total number of items is 20, we calculate the new position as \\( (2 + 8) \\% 20 = 10 \\). The tenth item on the path is the wall clock.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Moving counter-clockwise by 6 steps from the current position (wall clock). In a counter-clockwise movement, subtracting steps can be thought of as moving left, so if you go \"left\" 6 steps from the wall clock (10th position), you land at \\( (10 - 6) \\% 20 = 4 \\). The fourth item on the path is the small white.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Moving clockwise by 17 steps from the current position (small white). Calculating the new position, \\( (4 + 17) \\% 20 = 21 \\% 20 = 1 \\), because 21 divided by 20 leaves a remainder of 1. The first item on the path is the strainer.\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Moving counter-clockwise by 7 steps from the current position (strainer). Again, thinking of moving left, \\( (1 - 7) \\% 20 = -6 \\% 20 = 14 \\), because moving left 7 steps from the first position brings us to the fourteenth position (remember, negative results are adjusted by adding the total number of dots until they fit within the range). The fourteenth item on the path is the green mamba.\n\nTherefore, after following all these instructions, you will find yourself at the green mamba.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: green mamba."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
