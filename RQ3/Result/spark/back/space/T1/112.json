If the result is negative or zero, it wraps around to the corresponding positive index from the end of the list.\n3. **Clockwise Movement**: Adding steps to the current position means moving forwards. If the result exceeds the length of the list, it wraps around by subtracting the length of the list until it falls within the valid range.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Initial Position**: Start at \"limousine\" (position 5).\n\n2. **First Movement - Counter-Clockwise by 9 Steps**:\n   - Move 9 steps backwards from position 5: \\(5 - 9 = -4\\)\n   - Since the result is negative, wrap around by adding the length of the list (10): \\(-4 + 10 = 6\\)\n   - The new position is 6, which corresponds to the \"soccer ball\".\n\n3. **Second Movement - Clockwise by 7 Steps**:\n   - Move 7 steps forwards from position 6: \\(6 + 7 = 13\\)\n   - Since 13 exceeds the length of the list (10), wrap around by subtracting the length of the list: \\(13 - 10 = 3\\)\n   - The new position is 3, which corresponds to the \"crane\".\n\n4. **Third Movement - Clockwise by 6 Steps**:\n   - Move 6 steps forwards from position 3: \\(3 + 6 = 9\\)\n   - Since 9 is within the valid range, no wrap-around is needed.\n   - The new position is 9, which corresponds to the \"bell-cot\".\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: **bell-cot**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
