Let's break down each step:\n\n1. **Identify the starting position**: Starting from the top of the map, you find an orangutan. We will assign this position as dot number 1 (the top).\n\n2. **Movement in a counter-clockwise direction**:\n   - You move 18 steps counter-clockwise. Since moving counter-clockwise reduces the dot number, subtract 18 from the current dot number:\n     \\( 1 - 18 = -17 \\)\n   - To convert this into a positive equivalent within the range of 1 to 20, add 20:\n     \\( -17 + 20 = 3 \\)\n   - So, after 18 counter-clockwise steps, you are at dot 3, where there is a hummingbird.\n\n3. **Movement in a clockwise direction**:\n   - From dot 3, you move 2 steps clockwise. Clockwise steps increase the dot number, so add 2:\n     \\( 3 + 2 = 5 \\)\n   - Dot 5 contains a siamang.\n\n4. **Movement in a counter-clockwise direction**:\n   - From dot 5, you move 13 steps counter-clockwise. Subtract 13 from the current dot number:\n     \\( 5 - 13 = -8 \\)\n   - Add 20 to make it positive:\n     \\( -8 + 20 = 12 \\)\n   - Dot 12 has a German Shorthaired Pointer.\n\n5. **Movement in a clockwise direction**:\n   - From dot 12, you move 17 steps clockwise. Add 17 to the current dot number:\n     \\( 12 + 17 = 29 \\)\n   - Since the path is circular and only has 20 dots, subtract 20 to wrap around:\n     \\( 29 - 20 = 9 \\)\n   - Dot 9 contains a microphone.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: microphone."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
