The key principle is that moving clockwise increases our position by the number of steps taken, while moving counter-clockwise decreases our position. If the sum of the movements exceeds the total number of dots, it wraps around the circle due to its circular nature.\n\nLet's start by identifying the initial position and the positions after each move:\n\n1. **Initial Position**: Starting from the tiger shark, we first need to find its position on the map. Since we know the sequence of items, we can count them until we reach the tiger shark. The sequence starts at the Shih Tzu and ends with the lemon, so the tiger shark is the 9th item in this sequence (counting starts from 1). Therefore, the starting position is the 9th dot.\n\n2. **First Movement**: Move 6 steps in a clockwise direction. This means adding 6 to our current position. So, \\(9 + 6 = 15\\). After the first movement, we are at the 15th dot.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 13 steps in a clockwise direction. Adding these to our current position gives us \\(15 + 13 = 28\\). Since there are only 20 dots, we need to wrap around the circle. To find the new position, we use the modulo operation: \\(28 \\mod 20 = 8\\). After the second movement, we are at the 8th dot.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Moving counter-clockwise means subtracting from our current position. So, \\(8 - 7 = 1\\). After the third movement, we are at the 1st dot.\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Move 13 steps in a clockwise direction again. Adding these to our current position gives us \\(1 + 13 = 14\\). After the fourth movement, we are at the 14th dot.\n\nNow, we need to identify what is on the 14th dot. Looking at the sequence provided:\n\n1. Shih Tzu\n2. Rifle\n3. Minivan\n4. Sink\n5. Leopard\n6. Hammerhead shark\n7. Ibizan Hound\n8. African bush elephant\n9. Red admiral\n10. Printer\n11.
