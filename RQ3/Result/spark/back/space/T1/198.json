This means you move from the clothes iron to the minivan.\n3. **Second Movement**: You move 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. Since moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the minivan would take you back to the clothes iron, you are now at the clothes iron again.\n4. **Third Movement**: You move 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.
