Since there are 10 elements, this can be thought of as moving \\(10 - 4 = 6\\) steps forward in a clockwise direction from the Dobermann.\n   - Then, you move 3 more steps counter-clockwise.

Since the path is circular and has only 10 positions, we take modulo 10 of 15 to get \\(15 \\mod 10 = 5\\).\n   - After the third movement, you are at position \\(5 + 8 = 13\\).
