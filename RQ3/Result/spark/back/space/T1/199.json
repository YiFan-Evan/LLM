In a circular path, if you move beyond the last element, you loop back to the first element. Similarly, if you move before the first element, you loop back to the last element.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. You start from the oboe, which is the 4th element in the list (0-indexed).\n2. You move 1 step counter-clockwise from the oboe. This means you go to the previous element, which is the brain coral (3rd element).\n3. Next, you move 6 steps counter-clockwise from the brain coral. Counting 6 steps backward from the 3rd element gives us the following calculation: \\(3 - 6 = -3\\). Since we are in a circular path with 20 elements, we need to find the equivalent positive index. We add 20 to -3 to get \\(-3 + 20 = 17\\). Therefore, you land on the hatchet (17th element).\n4. After that, you move 5 steps clockwise from the hatchet. Moving 5 steps forward from the 17th element gives us \\(17 + 5 = 22\\). Since we are in a circular path with 20 elements, we subtract 20 from 22 to get \\(22 - 20 = 2\\). So, you end up on the overskirt (2nd element).\n5. Finally, you move 4 steps clockwise from the overskirt. Moving 4 steps forward from the 2nd element gives us \\(2 + 4 = 6\\). Therefore, you end up on the Pekingese (6th element).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Pekingese."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: You start at the oboe, which is the 3rd element in the list (0-indexed).\n\n2. **Movements**:\n   - Move 1 step clockwise from the oboe. This means moving to the next element, which is the moving van (4th element).\n   - Move 1 step counter-clockwise from the moving van. This means moving back to the oboe (3rd element).\n   - Move 1 step counter-clockwise again from the oboe. This means moving back to the brain coral (2nd element).\n   - Move 6 steps counter-clockwise from the brain coral. Counting 6 steps backward from the 2nd element gives us \\(2 - 6 = -4\\). Since we are in a circular path with 20 elements, we add 20 to -4 to get \\(-4 + 20 = 16\\). You land on the overskirt (16th element).\n   - Move 5 steps clockwise from the overskirt. Moving 5 steps forward from the 16th element gives us \\(16 + 5 = 21\\). Since we are in a circular path with 20 elements, we subtract 20 from 21 to get \\(21 - 20 = 1\\).
