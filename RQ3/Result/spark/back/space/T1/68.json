The key principles involved are:\n\n1. **Circular Path**: When moving in a circular path, if you go beyond the last item, you wrap around to the first item. Similarly, if you move backwards past the first item, you wrap around to the last item.\n2. **Clockwise and Counter-clockwise Movements**: These directions indicate how you move relative to your current position. Clockwise means moving forwards through the list of items, while counter-clockwise means moving backwards through the list of items.\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the path is circular with a fixed number of items (10 in this case), modulo arithmetic helps determine the new position after any number of steps.
