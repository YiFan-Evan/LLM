Move 5 steps counter-clockwise: Since moving counter-clockwise means going backwards, subtract 5 from the current position (2 - 5 = -3). Because the path is circular and has 10 dots, we add 10 to any negative result to find the equivalent positive position: -3 + 10 = 7. You are now at position 7.\n3. Move 4 steps clockwise: Adding 4 to the current position (7 + 4 = 11). Again, because it's a circular path with 10 dots, we take modulo 10 of the result: 11 % 10 = 1. So you move to position 1.\n4.
