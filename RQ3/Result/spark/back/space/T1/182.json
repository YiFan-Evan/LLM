Since it's a circular path, if we reach the end, we wrap around to the beginning. Thus, from dot 3, 2 steps counter-clockwise brings us to dot 1.\n   - Now, from dot 1, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise means moving left by 14 dots. Again considering the circular nature, 14 steps from dot 1 brings us to dot 18.\n3. **Clockwise Movements**:\n   - From dot 18, moving 17 steps clockwise means moving right by 17 dots.
