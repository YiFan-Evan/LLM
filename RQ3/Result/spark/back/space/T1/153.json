This accounts for wrapping around the circle if the steps exceed the number of elements.\n   - For example, moving 25 steps clockwise on a 20-dot path is the same as moving 5 steps clockwise (since 25 % 20 = 5).\n\n3. **Applying the Steps Given:**\n   - Start from the shoe store. We need to determine its position relative to the starting point (poke bonnet). From the description, the shoe store is the 13th item from the poke bonnet when moving clockwise.\n   - Move counter-clockwise by 19 steps: Since moving one step counter-clockwise from the shoe store would mean going to the previous item, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving `(20 - 19) % 20 = 1` step clockwise. So, we move 1 step clockwise from the shoe store to the hartebeest.\n   - Move clockwise by 10 steps: From the hartebeest, moving 10 steps clockwise lands us on the freight car (since the hartebeest is the 4th item from the shoe store, and adding 10 more steps puts us on the freight car).\n   - Move clockwise by 9 steps: From the freight car, moving 9 steps clockwise lands us on the semi-trailer truck (since the freight car is the 6th item from the shoe store, and adding 9 more steps puts us on the semi-trailer truck).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **semi-trailer truck**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
