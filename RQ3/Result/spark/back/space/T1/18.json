The pickup truck is two positions away from the albatross (albatross -> night snake -> pickup truck).\n4. **Calculate the movement**: Moving around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the pickup truck means moving past the pickup truck to the next items:\n   - Step 1: Bathtub\n   - Step 2: Rocking chair\n   - Step 3: Albatross (since we loop back to the beginning after completing one full circle)\n   - Step 4: Night snake\n   - Step 5: Pickup truck (again, since we complete another full circle)\n\nTherefore, after moving 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the pickup truck, you will find the **pickup truck** again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: pickup truck."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
