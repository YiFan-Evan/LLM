Starting at the soap dispenser (position 0), moving 1 step clockwise brings us to the chainsaw.\n2. Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the chainsaw brings us back to the soap dispenser (since moving 1 step counter-clockwise is essentially moving -1 step clockwise).\n3. Finally, moving 20 steps clockwise from the soap dispenser brings us back to the soap dispenser because 20 steps complete one full cycle of the circle.\n\nTherefore, after all these moves, you will find: **soap dispenser**."}]
