Starting from the umbrella, you move by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\nSteps to solve:\n1. Identify the starting position: Umbrella is at the 3rd position (0-based index).\n2. Add the number of steps to the starting position: 3 + 10 = 13.\n3. Since the total number of elements is 10 (the modulus operation will be used here to wrap around the circle), calculate the position within the circle: 13 % 10 = 3.\n4.
