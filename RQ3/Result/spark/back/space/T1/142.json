In a circular path with 20 elements, moving around the circle can be likened to performing modular arithmetic on the index of the current position.\n\nLet's denote the positions of the elements in the circle from 0 to 19, starting from the harvester as position 0. The trimaran is initially at position 14 (since it is the 15th element in the list).\n\nWe will perform the following steps:\n\n1. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise: Since moving counter-clockwise decreases the position number, we subtract 8 from the current position (14) and then take the result modulo 20 to wrap around the circle if necessary. This gives us \\( 14 - 8 = 6 \\).\n\n2. Move 12 steps clockwise: Moving clockwise increases the position number, so we add 12 to the current position (6) and take the result modulo 20. This gives us \\( 6 + 12 = 18 \\).\n\n3. Move 17 steps clockwise: Again, we add 17 to the current position (18) and take the result modulo 20. This gives us \\( 18 + 17 = 35 \\), and \\( 35 \\mod 20 = 15 \\).\n\n4. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise: We subtract 13 from the current position (15) and take the result modulo 20. This gives us \\( 15 - 13 = 2 \\).\n\nAfter these moves, you end up at position 2.
