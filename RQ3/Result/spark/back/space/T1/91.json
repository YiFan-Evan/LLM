The key principle here is that when you move in a circle and go past the end, you wrap around to the beginning. This can be calculated using modulo arithmetic.\n\nLet's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify the starting position**: You start at the ping-pong ball, which is the 7th element in the list (since there are 10 elements and they are indexed from 0).\n\n2. **Calculate the first movement**: You move 5 steps in a clockwise direction.
