So, we count 13 items from the golf cart:\n   - golf cart -> chest -> Sussex Spaniel -> drum -> nematode -> common redshank -> dumbbell -> ptarmigan -> dog sled -> red fox -> military aircraft -> spoonbill -> lionfish -> cheeseburger -> carton -> junco -> Lhasa Apso -> rain barrel -> through arch bridge -> flamingo.\n   Therefore, after 13 steps, we find the **flamingo**.\n\n3. **Move 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction**: Moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from the flamingo means we are moving \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\) steps clockwise (since moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving clockwise the other way around the ring). Counting 10 items from the flamingo:\n   - flamingo -> golf cart -> chest -> Sussex Spaniel -> drum -> nematode -> common redshank -> dumbbell -> ptarmigan -> dog sled.\n   Therefore, after these moves, we end up at the **dog sled**.\n\n4. **Move 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction**: Again, moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving clockwise the other way around the ring.
