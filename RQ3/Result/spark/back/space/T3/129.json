Now, let's process the movements step by step:\n\n1. Move clockwise by 13 steps from the padlock:\n   - Starting at position 20, moving 13 steps in a clockwise direction means counting forward 13 items.\n   - \\( 20 + 13 = 33 \\)\n   - Since there are only 20 dots, we take modulo 20: \\( 33 \\mod 20 = 13 \\).\n   - Therefore, the new position is 13, which corresponds to the **Soccer Ball**.\n\n2. Move counter-clockwise by 19 steps from the soccer ball (position 13):\n   - Moving counter-clockwise by 19 steps means counting backward 19 items.\n   - \\( 13 - 19 = -6 \\)\n   - Again, taking modulo 20: \\( -6 \\mod 20 = 14 \\).\n   - Therefore, the new position is 14, which corresponds to the **Eel**.\n\n3. Move clockwise by 7 steps from the eel (position 14):\n   - Starting at position 14, moving 7 steps in a clockwise direction means counting forward 7 items.\n   - \\( 14 + 7 = 21 \\)\n   - Taking modulo 20: \\( 21 \\mod 20 = 1 \\).\n   - Therefore, the new position is 1, which corresponds to the **Flagpole**.\n\n4. Move counter-clockwise by 6 steps from the flagpole (position 1):\n   - Moving counter-clockwise by 6 steps means counting backward 6 items.\n   - \\( 1 - 6 = -5 \\)\n   - Taking modulo 20: \\( -5 \\mod 20 = 15 \\).\n   - Therefore, the new position is 15, which corresponds to the **Grey Wolf**.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Grey Wolf**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
