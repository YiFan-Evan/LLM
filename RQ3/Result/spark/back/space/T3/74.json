Move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the Christmas stocking. Since moving counter-clockwise means going backwards in the sequence, and there are 10 dots in total, moving 5 steps back from the 3rd dot brings us to the 8th dot (3 - 5 = -2, and adding 10 to -2 gives us 8).

Finally, move 8 steps clockwise from the gossamer-winged butterfly. Adding 8 to the current position (9) gives us 17, and since there are only 10 dots, we subtract 10 from 17 to get 7.
