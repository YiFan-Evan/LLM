In this case, there are 20 elements on the path.\n\n2. **Calculating Steps**:\n   - You start from the Arctic fox and move 20 steps in a clockwise direction. Since the total number of elements on the path is also 20, moving 20 steps from any position will bring you back to the same starting position.\n\n3. **Identifying the Starting Point**:\n   - The Arctic fox is the sixth element on the path if we start counting from the top where the newt is located.\n\n4. **Conclusion**:\n   - By moving 20 steps from the Arctic fox in a clockwise direction, you will complete one full cycle of the path and end up back at the Arctic fox.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Arctic fox."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

This remainder will tell you how many positions to move from your starting point.\n\n2. **Calculating Steps**:\n   - You start from the Arctic fox and move 40 steps in a clockwise direction. Since there are 20 elements on the path, we need to calculate the remainder when 40 is divided by 20.\n   - \\( 40 \\div 20 = 2 \\) with a remainder of 0.\n\n3. **Interpreting the Remainder**:\n   - A remainder of 0 means that after completing two full cycles around the path, you end up back at the starting point.\n\n4. **Identifying the Starting Point**:\n   - The Arctic fox is the fifth element on the path if we start counting from the top where the newt is located.\n\n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - By moving 40 steps from the Arctic fox in a clockwise direction, you will complete two full cycles of the path and end up back at the Arctic fox.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Arctic fox."}]
