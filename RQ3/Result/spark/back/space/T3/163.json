The number of steps required to complete one full round is equal to the total number of elements (or dots) on the path.\n\n2. **Identifying the Starting Point**: According to the problem, you start at the soap dispenser. This means the soap dispenser is your reference point or position zero.\n\n3. **Calculating the Position After Movement**: You move 20 steps in a clockwise direction from the soap dispenser.
