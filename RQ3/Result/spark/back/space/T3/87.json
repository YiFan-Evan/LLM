In this case, there are 10 elements on the path.\n2. **Clockwise Movement**: Moving in a clockwise direction around a circular path means advancing through the elements in the order they are listed from left to right.\n3. **Step Movement**: Each step moves you from one element to the next in the specified direction. If the number of steps exceeds the total number of elements on the path, you need to wrap around (modulo operation).\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Identify Starting Point**: You start at the carousel, which is the 7th element in the list.\n2. **First Movement**: Move 2 steps in a clockwise direction from the carousel. This takes us to the 9th element, which is the stupa.\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 4 steps in a clockwise direction from the stupa. This takes us to the 1st element, which is back to the tree frog (since \\(7 + 4 = 11\\) and \\(11 \\mod 10 = 1\\)).\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 2 steps in a clockwise direction from the tree frog.
