The circular path consists of 20 connected dots, each representing an item. We can number these items from 1 to 20 in a clockwise direction starting from the cloak:\n\n1. Cloak\n2. Barrel\n3.

Flagpole\n\nStarting from the orangutan (item 18), you move around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Since moving counter-clockwise means going backwards, subtracting 18 from 18 gives us 0. This places you back at the starting point, which is the orangutan.\n\nNext, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction. Clockwise movement means going forwards, so adding 2 to your current position (18) gives us 20. However, since there are only 20 items and positions are cyclic, we wrap around to the first item, which is the cloak.\n\nThen, you move around the ring by 13 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Subtracting 13 from your current position (cloak, which is item 1) gives us -12. Again, wrapping around from a negative number means going clockwise from the end of the list, so -12 steps from item 20 (the flagpole) brings us to item 8 (Hummingbird).\n\nFinally, you move around the ring by 17 steps in a clockwise direction. Adding 17 to your current position (8, which is the Hummingbird) gives us 25. Since there are only 20 items and positions are cyclic, we wrap around and calculate 25 modulo 20, which equals 5.
