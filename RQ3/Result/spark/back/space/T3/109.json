The key principles involved are:\n\n1. **Circular Motion**: Since the path is circular and has a fixed number of positions, moving beyond the last position will loop back to the start. This means that moving 10 steps in any direction will return you to the starting point.\n\n2. **Step Calculation**: When moving in a circle, the effective number of steps can be calculated by considering the total number of positions modulo the number of elements on the path.
