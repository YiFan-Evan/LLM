We need to find its position on the circular path of 10 elements. Let's assign positions to each element in a clockwise direction starting from the ladle at position 1:\n   - Ladle (1)\n   - Collie (2)\n   - Grey Whale (3)\n   - Lens Cap (4)\n   - Bikini (5)\n   - Solar Thermal Collector (6)\n   - Overskirt (7)\n   - Notebook Computer (8)\n   - Paddle (9)\n   - Horse-drawn Vehicle (10)\n\n2. **Perform the Moves**:\n   - First move: Move 1 step in a clockwise direction from the grey whale. This takes us to the lens cap.\n   - Second move: Move 3 steps in a clockwise direction from the lens cap. This takes us to the solar thermal collector.\n   - Third move: Move 8 steps in a clockwise direction from the solar thermal collector. Since moving 8 steps from position 6 would take us to position 14, and the path is circular with only 10 positions, we need to calculate the new position by taking the remainder of 14 divided by 10. \\(14 \\mod 10 = 4\\).
