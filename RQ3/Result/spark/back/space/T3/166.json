The position of the Maltese in the list is 4th (0-based index).\n\n2. **Counter-clockwise Movement**: \n   - First move counter-clockwise by 3 steps. This means we subtract 3 from the starting index. Since we are on a circular path, if the result is negative, we add the total number of dots (20) to wrap it around.\n   - New position = (4 - 3 + 20) % 20 = 1 % 20 = 1.

Again, use modulo 20 to wrap around the circle if necessary.\n   - New position = (1 + 19) % 20 = 20 % 20 = 0.

Subtract 13 from the current index.\n   - New position = (0 - 13 + 20) % 20 = 7 % 20 = 7. The item at this position is a Cardigan Welsh Corgi.\n\n5. **Clockwise Movement**: \n   - Finally, move clockwise by 9 steps.
