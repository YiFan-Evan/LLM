Moving clockwise means going forward along the path, while moving counter-clockwise means going backward.\n\nWe are given that we start at the traffic light, which is located at position 1 (the top of the path).

Move 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction.\n4. Move 6 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\nFirstly, let's determine the positions after each move:\n\n1. Starting from the traffic light (position 1), moving 7 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 7 from 1: \\( 1 - 7 = -6 \\)\n   - To convert negative positions into positive ones, we add the total number of dots (20): \\( -6 + 20 = 14 \\)\n   - So, after this move, we are at position 14, where there is a quilt.\n\n2. From position 14, moving 16 steps counter-clockwise:\n   - Subtract 16 from 14: \\( 14 - 16 = -2 \\)\n   - Add 20 to get the positive equivalent: \\( -2 + 20 = 18 \\)\n   - After this move, we are at position 18, which has a Treeing Walker Coonhound.\n\n3.
