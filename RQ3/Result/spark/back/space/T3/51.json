If you move more than 10 steps in either direction, you loop back around to the starting point.\n2. **Clockwise Movement**: When moving clockwise, each step moves you to the next item in the sequence.\n3. **Counter-Clockwise Movement**: When moving counter-clockwise, each step moves you to the previous item in the sequence.\n4. **Modulo Operation**: To determine the final position after a given number of steps, use the modulo operation (%) to find the effective movement within the circular path.\n\n### Steps to Solve the Problem:\n1. **Identify Starting Point**: You start from the planetarium. We need to locate its position in the sequence.\n   - Items in order: vase (start), wardrobe, flamingo, planetarium, grey wolf, terrapin, koala, backpack, pan flute, triceratops.\n   - The planetarium is the 4th item in the sequence.\n\n2. **Movement Calculation**:\n   - First, move 6 steps counter-clockwise.\n   - Then, move 10 steps clockwise.\n\n3. **Effective Counter-Clockwise Movement**:\n   - Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the 4th position (planetarium):\n     \\[\n     4 - 6 = -2\n     \\]\n   - Since the path is circular and has 10 items, convert -2 to a positive index using modulo operation:\n     \\[\n     -2 + 10 = 8 \\quad (\\text{because } -2 \\% 10 = 8)\n     \\]\n   - The 8th item in the sequence is the pan flute.\n\n4. **Effective Clockwise Movement**:\n   - Now, from the pan flute (8th position), move 10 steps clockwise:\n     \\[\n     8 + 10 = 18\n     \\]\n   - Again, since the path is circular with 10 items, convert 18 to a positive index using modulo operation:\n     \\[\n     18 \\% 10 = 8\n     \\]\n   - The 8th item is still the pan flute.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: pan flute."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
