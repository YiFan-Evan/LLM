Starting from the golf ball (dot 3), you move 3 steps counter-clockwise. Since moving counter-clockwise reduces the dot number, we subtract 3 from 3:\n   3 - 3 = 0\n   However, since the dots are numbered from 1 to 5, we need to adjust for the circular nature of the path. If the result is less than 1, we add the total number of dots (5) to get the correct dot:\n   0 + 5 = 5\n   So, after moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from dot 3, you end up at dot 5, where the chambered nautilus is located.\n\n2. Next, you move 5 steps clockwise from your current position (dot 5). Moving clockwise increases the dot number, so we add 5 to 5:\n   5 + 5 = 10\n   Again, since the dots are numbered from 1 to 5, we need to adjust for the circular nature of the path. If the result is greater than 5, we subtract the total number of dots (5) to get the correct dot:\n   10 - 5 = 5\n   So, after moving 5 steps clockwise from dot 5, you end up at dot 5 again, where the chambered nautilus is still located.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: chambered nautilus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
