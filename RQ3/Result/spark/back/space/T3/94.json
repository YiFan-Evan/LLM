From position 2, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise takes us to position 2 - 7 = -5. Since the path is circular and has 10 positions, we need to adjust for the negative index by adding 10 until we get a positive number within the range of our positions. So, -5 + 10 = 5. Thus, after the first movement, you end up at position 5, which is the snoek.\n   \n2. Next, from position 5 (snoek), you move 3 steps in a clockwise direction. This takes you to position 5 + 3 = 8. Position 8 corresponds to the high-speed train.\n   \n3. Finally, from position 8 (high-speed train), you move 6 steps in a clockwise direction. This takes you to position 8 + 6 = 14.
