This means that moving one step beyond the last item brings you back to the first item.\n   \n2. **Clockwise Movement**: Moving in a clockwise direction on a circular path means progressing from one item to the next in the given order until you complete the full circle and return to the starting point.\n\n3. **Steps Counting**: When moving steps in a circular path, each step corresponds to one position shift along the path. If you move more steps than there are items on the path, you continue counting from the beginning after completing the full circle.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the given problem:\n\n- We start at the top where the Redbone Coonhound is located.\n- Moving clockwise from the Redbone Coonhound, we encounter the cannon (1st step), waffle iron (2nd step), tricycle (3rd step), and odometer (4th step).\n\nStarting from the odometer, we need to move by 3 steps in a clockwise direction and then move by 1 step in a clockwise direction.
