We start from the apiary and move according to the instructions given:\n\n1. **First Move**: 6 steps counter-clockwise from the apiary.\n2. **Second Move**: 10 steps clockwise from the position after the first move.\n3. **Third Move**: 9 steps counter-clockwise from the position after the second move.\n4. **Fourth Move**: 7 steps counter-clockwise from the position after the third move.\n\nLet's calculate each step one by one:\n\n### Step 1: 6 Steps Counter-Clockwise\nFrom the apiary, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise means going back 6 positions on the circle. Since there are 20 dots in total, counting back 6 dots from the apiary gives us:\n\\[ \\text{apiary} - 6 = \\text{position of the cicada} \\]\nSo, the first stop is at the cicada.\n\n### Step 2: 10 Steps Clockwise\nFrom the cicada, moving 10 steps clockwise means moving forward 10 positions on the circle. This takes us to:\n\\[ \\text{cicada} + 10 = \\text{position of the pot} \\]\nSo, the second stop is at the pot.\n\n### Step 3: 9 Steps Counter-Clockwise\nFrom the pot, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise means going back 9 positions on the circle. This takes us to:\n\\[ \\text{pot} - 9 = \\text{position of the American alligator} \\]\nSo, the third stop is at the American alligator.\n\n### Step 4: 7 Steps Counter-Clockwise\nFrom the American alligator, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise means going back 7 positions on the circle. This takes us to:\n\\[ \\text{American alligator} - 7 = \\text{position of the Cocker Spaniels} \\]\nSo, the fourth stop is at the Cocker Spaniels.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **Cocker Spaniels**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
