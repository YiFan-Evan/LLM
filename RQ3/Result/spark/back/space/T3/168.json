Bell Pepper (start) - Position 0\n2. Cairn Terrier - Position 1\n3. Poncho - Position 2\n4. Military Uniform - Position 3\n5. Electric Guitar - Position 4\n6. Crate - Position 5\n7.

Starting from the Cairn Terrier (Position 1), move 8 steps clockwise:\n\\[ 1 + 8 = 9 \\]\nThis lands us at the Dandie Dinmont Terrier (Position 8).\n\n2. From the current position (Dandie Dinmont Terrier, Position 8), move 18 steps clockwise:\n\\[ 8 + 18 = 26 \\]\nSince the map is circular and has only 20 positions, we need to reduce 26 modulo 20:\n\\[ 26 \\mod 20 = 6 \\]\nThis places us at the Crate (Position 5).\n\n3. From the current position (Crate, Position 5), move 1 step clockwise:\n\\[ 5 + 1 = 6 \\]\nWe remain at the Crate (Position 5).\n\n4.
