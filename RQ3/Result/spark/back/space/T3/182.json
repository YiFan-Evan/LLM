This means moving to the left by 2 positions. Since the path is circular and has 20 elements, subtracting 2 from the position of the knee pad (2) gives us 0. However, since we're starting from the second element, we wrap around the end to the beginning, which places us at the last element before wrapping back to the start, i.e., the trilobite.\n\n3. **Second Move**: From the trilobite's position, move 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Subtracting 14 from the trilobite's position (19th element) results in -5. To find the actual position, add 20 to -5 (to account for the circular nature), which equals 15. So, we end up at the kingsnake.\n\n4. **Third Move**: From the kingsnake's position, move 17 steps in a clockwise direction. Adding 17 to the kingsnake's position (15th element) results in 32. To find the actual position, subtract 20 from 32 because we're dealing with a circular path, which equals 12. Thus, we land on the stretcher.\n\n5. **Fourth Move**: From the stretcher's position, move 5 steps in a clockwise direction. Adding 5 to the stretcher's position (12th element) results in 17.
