The fundamental principles involved are:\n\n1. **Modular Arithmetic**: Since the path is circular with 20 dots, moving around the ring can be thought of as addition in a modulo 20 system. That means if you move more than 20 steps, you essentially loop back around to your original position or continue from there.\n   \n2. **Direction of Movement**: Clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) movements will have opposite effects on your position. For example, a CW movement increases your position while a CCW movement decreases it.\n\n3. **Total Movement Calculation**: To find the final position after multiple movements, add up all the steps taken (considering direction). Each CW step is +1, and each CCW step is -1.\n\nLet's break down the movements step by step:\n\n1. Start at the Asian elephant.\n2. Move 15 steps CW: \\( +15 \\)\n3.
