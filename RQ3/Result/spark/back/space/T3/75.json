Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Understanding the Circular Path**: The circular path has 10 connected dots, each representing an item. Starting from the top (where you find a volcano), the items are arranged in a specific order as described.\n\n2. **Initial Position**: You start at the custard apple, which is the second item on the list (since the volcano is the first).\n\n3. **Movement Steps**:\n   - First, move counter-clockwise by 8 steps. In a counter-clockwise direction, moving 8 steps means going back 8 positions from the starting point.\n   - Next, move counter-clockwise by 3 more steps. This continues in the same direction, adding another 3 steps to the previous movement.\n   - Finally, move clockwise by 6 steps. Since moving clockwise reverses the direction of counting, this effectively subtracts 6 steps from the current position after the first two movements.\n\n4. **Calculating the Final Position**: \n   - Starting from the custard apple (second position), after the first movement (8 steps counter-clockwise): \\( 2 - 8 = -6 \\). Since we cannot have negative positions, we add the total number of dots (10) to wrap around the circle: \\( -6 + 10 = 4 \\). So, the new position is 4th, which corresponds to the hyena.\n   - After the second movement (3 steps counter-clockwise from position 4): \\( 4 - 3 = 1 \\). This places us at the Labrador Retriever.\n   - After the third movement (6 steps clockwise from position 1): \\( 1 + 6 = 7 \\).

Since we cannot have negative positions, we add the total number of dots (10) to wrap around the circle: \\( -14 + 10 = -4 \\).
