To find the position of the tiger beetle, we count the items starting from the partridge until we reach the tiger beetle.\n   - Partridge (1)\n   - Black and Tan Coonhound (2)\n   - Tank (3)\n   - Windsor tie (4)\n   - Sports car (5)\n   - Tiger cat (6)\n   - Gas mask (7)\n   - Planetarium (8)\n   - Overskirt (9)\n   - Parachute (10)\n   - Dowitcher (11)\n   - Black-footed ferret (12)\n   - Tiger beetle (13)\n\n   Thus, the tiger beetle is at position 13 on the circular path.\n\n3. **Movement Instructions**:\n   - Move around the ring by 17 steps in a clockwise direction.\n   - Move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction.\n   - Move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n   - Move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\n4. **Calculating the Final Position**:\n   - First move: From position 13, moving 17 steps clockwise: \\( 13 + 17 = 30 \\). Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we take modulo 20: \\( 30 \\mod 20 = 10 \\).
