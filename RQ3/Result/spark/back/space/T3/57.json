When you reach the 10th dot, you loop back to the first dot. This means that moving more than 10 steps in any direction will result in a position that can be found by taking the remainder when dividing the total number of steps by 10.\n\n2. **Initial Position and Movements**: You start at the paper towel, which is your initial position. From here, you make two sets of movements:\n   - First, you move 7 steps clockwise.\n   - Then, you move 10 steps clockwise.\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Movement**: Since the path is circular and has 10 dots, moving 10 steps in any direction will bring you back to your starting point. Therefore, moving 10 steps from the paper towel brings you back to the paper towel. However, before that, you moved 7 steps, so let's focus on calculating the effective movement after these 7 steps.\n\n4. **Effective Movement After 7 Steps**: Starting from the paper towel (let's call this position 0 for simplicity), moving 7 steps clockwise means you end up at position \\(0 + 7 = 7\\). Given the positions on the path are as follows (starting from the crate):\n   - Crate (0), Shoe Store (1), Snowplow (2), Sidewinder (3), Monastery (4), Vault (5), Grasshopper (6), Paper Towel (7), Crossword (8), Sundial (9)\n\n   At position 7, you find the Paper Towel again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: paper towel."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.

Therefore, moving 14 steps brings you to a position equivalent to moving \\(14 \\mod 10 = 4\\) steps from the starting point.
