If you move beyond the last element (paddle wheel), you would wrap around to the first element (ear) again. Similarly, moving past the first element in a counter-clockwise direction would loop you back to the last element (paddle wheel).\n\n2. **Calculating Net Movements**:\n   - Starting from the mantis, moving clockwise by 6 steps: Since there are only 10 elements, after reaching the end of the list, you wrap around to the beginning. Thus, moving 6 steps from mantis (which is at position 1) brings you to position 7 (threshing machine).\n   - Then moving counter-clockwise by 8 steps: This means moving backward. From threshing machine (position 7), moving 8 steps backward would normally take you to position -1. However, since it's a circular path, you wrap around to the end. To find the new position, calculate \\(7 - 8 = -1\\), then add 10 to wrap around, which gives \\(9\\). So, you land at the kit fox.\n   - Finally, moving counter-clockwise by 6 more steps from kit fox (position 9): \\(9 - 6 = 3\\).
