Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we count backwards from the European green lizard:\n   - 1 step back from European green lizard is cucumber.\n   - 2 steps back from European green lizard is polar bear.\n   - 3 steps back from European green lizard is cockroach.\n3. Now, move 1 step in a clockwise direction from cockroach:\n   - 1 step forward from cockroach is submarine.\n4. Finally, move 8 steps in a clockwise direction from submarine:\n   - Moving 8 steps from submarine means going around the circle more than once. To find out where we end up, we divide 8 by 10 (the number of dots/items on the path) to find the remainder. 8 divided by 10 gives a remainder of 8.\n   - This means we go around the circle once (10 steps) and then 8 more steps.\n   - Starting from submarine, 10 steps forward brings us back to submarine (complete circle), and then 8 more steps brings us to the 8th item, which is ice cream.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ice cream."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
