Starting from the golf ball, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 16 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.

Moving counter-clockwise means going backwards around the circle, while moving clockwise means going forwards. The key is to determine where you land after each series of movements.\n\nHere's how we can solve it step by step:\n\n1. **Starting Position**: You start at the golf ball, which is located at position 0 (the top of the path).\n\n2. **First Movement**: Move 8 steps counter-clockwise. In a circular path, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from position 0 means moving to the 8th dot before the starting point. Since there are 20 dots total, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise takes us to position \\( 20 - 8 = 12 \\). At position 12, you find an Old English Sheepdog.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 5 steps clockwise from position 12. Moving 5 steps clockwise from position 12 means advancing to the next 5 dots. This takes us to position \\( 12 + 5 = 17 \\). At position 17, you find an otter.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 16 steps clockwise from position 17. Moving 16 steps clockwise from position 17 means advancing to the next 16 dots. This takes us to position \\( 17 + 16 = 33 \\). Since the path has only 20 dots and we move beyond the end, we need to wrap around the circle. To determine the new position, we take modulo 20: \\( 33 \\mod 20 = 13 \\). At position 13, you find an Alpine ibex.\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Move 14 steps counter-clockwise from position 13. Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise from position 13 means moving to the 14th dot before the current position. This takes us to position \\( 13 - 14 = -1 \\). Again, since the path is circular, we need to wrap around. To determine the new position, we add 20 to the negative value: \\( -1 + 20 = 19 \\). At position 19, you find a chambered nautilus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: chambered nautilus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

At position 4, you find a lotion.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 10 steps clockwise from position 4. Moving 10 steps clockwise from position 4 means advancing to the next 10 dots.

Moving 32 steps clockwise from position 14 means advancing to the next 32 dots. Since the path has only 20 dots, we need to wrap around the circle. To determine the new position, we take modulo 20: \\( 14 + 32 = 46 \\), and \\( 46 \\mod 20 = 6 \\). At position 6, you find a pirate ship.\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Move 28 steps counter-clockwise from position 6. Moving 28 steps counter-clockwise from position 6 means moving to the 28th dot before the current position. This takes us to position \\( 6 - 28 = -22 \\). Again, since the path is circular, we need to wrap around. To determine the new position, we add 20 to the negative value: \\( -22 + 20 = -2 \\). Since we cannot have a negative index, we adjust by adding 20 again: \\( -2 + 20 = 18 \\). At position 18, you find a jacamar.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: jacamar."}]
