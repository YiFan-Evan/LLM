First, move counter-clockwise by 3 steps:\n   - Since moving counter-clockwise means going backwards, we subtract 3 from the starting position (position 2):\n     \\(2 - 3 = -1\\)\n   - To handle the negative index in a circular list, add the total number of elements (20):\n     \\(20 + (-1) = 19\\)\n   - So, after this step, you land on the miniskirt.\n\n3. Next, move clockwise by 7 steps from the current position:\n   - Add 7 to the current position (19):\n     \\(19 + 7 = 26\\)\n   - Wrap around the circular path by taking modulo 20:\n     \\(26 \\mod 20 = 6\\)\n   - After this step, you land on the lighter.\n\n4. Then, move clockwise by 11 steps from the current position:\n   - Add 11 to the current position (6):\n     \\(6 + 11 = 17\\)\n   - No wrap around needed since it's within bounds:\n     \\(17 \\mod 20 = 17\\)\n   - After this step, you land on the refrigerator.\n\n5.
