Starting from the ear, the elements are:\n   - Ear (start)\n   - Mongoose\n   - Bagel\n   - Border Collie\n   - Screw\n   - Paintbrush\n   - Labrador Retriever\n   - Waffle iron\n   - Jeep\n   - Ice pop\n\n2. **Identifying the Positions**: Each element can be assigned a number starting from 0 for the ear and increasing clockwise.
