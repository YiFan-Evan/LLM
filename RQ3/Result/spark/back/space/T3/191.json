The path consists of 20 connected dots arranged in a circle. Starting from the radiator at the top, the items are listed in a clockwise direction up to the sunscreen.\n\nWe can represent the position of each item by its index, where the radiator is at index 0. Therefore, the sunscreen is at index 19 (since there are 20 items total, and we start counting from 0).\n\nNow, let's analyze the movements:\n\n1. Starting from the sunscreen (index 19), move 18 steps in a clockwise direction.\n2. Move 9 steps in a clockwise direction.\n3. Move 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n4. Move 13 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\nWe need to calculate the final position after all these movements. Since the path is circular, moving around it will eventually bring us back to the starting point if we move a multiple of 20 steps. We can use modulo arithmetic to determine the effective number of steps for each movement.\n\nLet's calculate each movement step by step:\n\n1. From the sunscreen (index 19), moving 18 steps clockwise:\n   Effective steps = (18 + 19) % 20 = 37 % 20 = 17\n   New position = 17\n\n2. From the new position (index 17), moving 9 steps clockwise:\n   Effective steps = (9 + 17) % 20 = 26 % 20 = 6\n   New position = 6\n\n3. From the new position (index 6), moving 14 steps counter-clockwise:\n   Effective steps = (20 - 14 + 6) % 20 = 12 % 20 = 12\n   New position = 12\n\n4. From the new position (index 12), moving 13 steps clockwise:\n   Effective steps = (13 + 12) % 20 = 25 % 20 = 5\n   Final position = 5\n\nNow, we need to find out which item corresponds to index 5.
