The key principles involved are:\n\n1. **Circular Path Navigation**: When moving on a circular path, if you reach the end of the path, you loop back to the beginning. This is akin to modulo arithmetic where the remainder determines the new position after exceeding the boundary.\n2. **Step Counting**: Each step taken moves you from one dot to the next in the specified direction (clockwise in this case).\n3. **Starting Point**: Your initial position serves as the reference point for counting steps.\n\nLet's break down the solution step-by-step:\n\n1. **Identify the Starting Point**: You start at the pajamas.\n2. **Determine the Total Number of Dots**: There are 10 dots on the circular path.\n3. **Calculate the New Position**: Move 10 steps from the starting point (pajamas).\n\nSince there are 10 dots, moving 10 steps from any point will bring you back to the same point because \\(10 \\mod 10 = 0\\). Therefore, after 10 steps from pajamas, you will be back at pajamas.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: pajamas."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
