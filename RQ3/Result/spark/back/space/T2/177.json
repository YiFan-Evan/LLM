Therefore, we can reduce each movement modulo 20 to find the effective movement.\n\nLet's calculate the effective movements:\n\n1. Moving 11 steps clockwise: No change needed as it is less than 20.\n2. Moving 17 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 3 steps clockwise (since 20 - 17 = 3).\n3. Moving 4 steps clockwise: No change needed as it is less than 20.\n4. Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise: This is equivalent to moving 15 steps clockwise (since 20 - 5 = 15).\n\nNow, we add up all the effective movements:\n11 + 3 + 4 + 15 = 33\n\nSince moving 33 steps clockwise is the same as moving 13 steps clockwise (33 - 20 = 13), we need to find what item is 13 steps clockwise from the minibus.\n\nThe items on the path, starting from the minibus and moving clockwise, are:\n1. water buffalo\n2. jack-o'-lantern\n3. computer mouse\n4. toy store\n5. drumstick\n6. school bus\n7.
