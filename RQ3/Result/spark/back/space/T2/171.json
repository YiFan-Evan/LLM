Adding 20 to get a positive index, we have \\(-1 + 20 = 19\\). So, after this step, you are on Dot 19 (flagpole).\n\n### Step 2: Move 2 steps clockwise from Dot 19 (flagpole)\nMoving clockwise from Dot 19, we add 2 to get \\(19 + 2 = 21\\). Since there are only 20 dots, we take modulo 20: \\(21 \\mod 20 = 1\\). So, after this step, you are on Dot 1 (barrel).\n\n### Step 3: Move 13 steps counter-clockwise from Dot 1 (barrel)\nMoving counter-clockwise from Dot 1, we subtract 13 to get \\(1 - 13 = -12\\). Adding 20 to get a positive index, we have \\(-12 + 20 = 8\\). So, after this step, you are on Dot 8 (siamang).\n\n### Step 4: Move 17 steps clockwise from Dot 8 (siamang)\nMoving clockwise from Dot 8, we add 17 to get \\(8 + 17 = 25\\). Taking modulo 20, we have \\(25 \\mod 20 = 5\\).
