Each dot represents an item on the path. When you move around the circle, if you go past the last dot, you loop back to the first dot.\n\n2. **Identify Initial Position**: You start at the top of the path where there is a warthog. Let's number the dots from 1 to 10 starting from the warthog as dot 1.\n\n3. **Mapping Out the Items**:\n   - Dot 1: Warthog\n   - Dot 2: Rotary dial telephone\n   - Dot 3: Mexican hairless dog\n   - Dot 4: Harmonica\n   - Dot 5: Gong\n   - Dot 6: Great Dane\n   - Dot 7: Beaver (starting point for your movements)\n   - Dot 8: Black stork\n   - Dot 9: Gila monster\n   - Dot 10: Cocktail shaker\n\n4. **Movements**:\n   - First, move 6 steps counter-clockwise from the beaver (dot 7). Since it is counter-clockwise, we subtract 6 from 7:\n     - 7 - 6 = 1\n   - Next, move 5 steps clockwise from dot 1. Since it is clockwise, we add 5 to 1:\n     - 1 + 5 = 6\n   - Finally, move 1 step clockwise from dot 6. Again, we add 1 to 6:\n     - 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5. **Final Position**: After all these movements, you end up back at dot 7 where the beaver is located.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Beaver."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.

Since it is clockwise, we add 6 to 7:\n     - 7 + 6 = 13\n   - To find the correct position on the 10-dot circle, we use modulo operation:\n     - 13 % 10 = 3\n   - Next, move 5 steps counter-clockwise from dot 3. Since it is counter-clockwise, we subtract 5 from 3:\n     - 3 - 5 = -2\n   - To adjust for negative index in a circular path, we add 10 until we get a positive number:\n     - -2 + 10 = 8\n   - Finally, move 1 step counter-clockwise from dot 8.
