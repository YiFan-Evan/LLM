We will then calculate the final position after the given movements.\n\n### Fundamental Principles:\n1. **Circular Path**: The path is circular with a total of 20 dots. This means that moving 20 steps in any direction (clockwise or counter-clockwise) brings you back to the starting point.\n2. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the path is circular, we use modulo arithmetic to wrap around the path.
