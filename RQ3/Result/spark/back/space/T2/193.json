Since there are 20 dots, subtracting 3 from 1 gives us a new position of 18 (1 - 3 = -2 + 20 = 18).\n   - Next, move clockwise by 16 steps: Adding 16 to the current position of 18 gives us a new position of 4 (18 + 16 = 34, but since it's a circular path, we take modulo 20: 34 % 20 = 4).\n   - Finally, move clockwise by 7 more steps: Adding 7 to the current position of 4 gives us a new position of 11 (4 + 7 = 11).\n\n5. **Identifying the Element at the Final Position:**\n   - At position 11 on the circular path, we find the \"ant.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
