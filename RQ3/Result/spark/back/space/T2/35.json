In this specific scenario, the path has 5 dots connected in a circle.\n\n2. **Identifying Initial Position and Items**: You start at the Carolina anole, which is positioned at the top of the path. The items on the path, moving clockwise from the Carolina anole, are a brown bear, a quill, a paddle, and a marmoset.\n\n3. **Movement Explanation**: Moving counter-clockwise essentially means going backwards on the path. Since the path is circular, after completing one full cycle (which would be 5 steps), you'd return to your starting point.\n\n4. **Calculating the New Position**: Starting from the Carolina anole, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise means completing one full round of the 5-dot circle and ending up right back where you started.
