Let's break down each movement step by step.\n\n1. **Starting Point**: The starting point is at the trimaran.\n\n2. **First Movement**: Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the trimaran. Since moving counter-clockwise means going backwards on the circle, we count 8 steps back from the trimaran. Starting from the trimaran and counting 8 steps backwards, we land at the balloon (since the trimaran is at position 15 and 15 - 8 = 7).\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Moving 12 steps clockwise from the balloon. Moving clockwise means going forwards on the circle. Starting from the balloon (position 7), we count 12 steps forwards:\n   - From position 7, 12 steps forward would be \\( 7 + 12 = 19 \\). Since there are only 20 positions, and the positions are numbered from 1 to 20, position 19 corresponds to the cougar.\n\n4. **Third Movement**: Moving 17 steps clockwise from the cougar. Starting from the cougar (position 19):\n   - \\( 19 + 17 = 36 \\). Since we are working within a circular path of 20 positions, we take modulo 20: \\( 36 \\mod 20 = 16 \\). Position 16 corresponds to the microwave oven.\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Moving 13 steps counter-clockwise from the microwave oven. Starting from the microwave oven (position 16), we count 13 steps backwards:\n   - \\( 16 - 13 = 3 \\).

Moving counter-clockwise means going backwards on the circle. Starting from the eastern diamondback rattlesnake (position 10):\n   - \\( 10 - 12 = -2 \\), but since we are working within a circular path of 20 positions, we adjust for negative values by adding 20: \\( -2 + 20 = 18 \\).
