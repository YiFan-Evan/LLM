This ensures that the position stays within the range of 1 to n.\n   - Moving counter-clockwise by k steps is equivalent to subtracting k from your current position, and if the result is negative, adding n to make it positive again.\n\n2. **Applying the Concepts**:\n   - Start at the langur, which is the 18th element (since the langur is 18th in the list).\n   - Move counter-clockwise by 15 steps. This is equivalent to subtracting 15 from 18: 18 - 15 = 3. Since the result is positive, our new position is 3.\n   - Next, move clockwise by 6 steps. This is equivalent to adding 6 to our current position of 3: 3 + 6 = 9.\n   - Then, move clockwise by 12 steps: 9 + 12 = 21. Since 21 exceeds the total number of elements (20), we take modulo 20: 21 % 20 = 1.\n   - Finally, move clockwise by 8 steps: 1 + 8 = 9.\n\n3. **Finding the Final Element**:\n   - At position 9, we find the \"flatworm\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: flatworm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
