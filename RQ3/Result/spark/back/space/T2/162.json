Starting from the carton, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 16 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 11 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.

The key principle here is that moving around a circular path by a certain number of steps can be thought of as performing arithmetic operations in a modular system, where the total number of elements (in this case, 20) acts as the modulus.\n\nHere\u2019s how we apply this principle:\n\n1. **Starting Point**: You start at the carton, which is positioned 18th on the path (considering the purse is at the 1st position and counting clockwise).\n\n2. **First Movement**: You move 10 steps counter-clockwise. Since you are moving counter-clockwise from the 18th position, you effectively move clockwise through the remaining 2 points to complete the circle, then continue for 8 more steps (10 - 2 = 8), landing on the 16th position.\n\n3. **Second Movement**: Next, you move 16 steps clockwise from the 16th position. This brings you to the 2nd position (16 + 16 = 32; 32 % 20 = 2).\n\n4. **Third Movement**: After that, you move 11 steps counter-clockwise from the 2nd position. Moving counter-clockwise means you go back 18 steps to complete the circle (20 - 2 = 18), then continue for 1 more step (11 - 18 = -7; adding 20 to make it positive gives us 13), landing on the 13th position.\n\n5. **Fourth Movement**: Finally, you move 2 steps counter-clockwise from the 13th position. This brings you back to the 11th position (13 - 2 = 11).\n\nNow, let's identify what item is located at the 11th position on our circular map. Starting from the purse (1st position), and counting the items clockwise:\n\n1. Purse\n2. Taxicab\n3. Nile crocodile\n4. Academic gown\n5. Baseball\n6. Convertible\n7. Carolina anole\n8.
