If the result is negative, we add 20 (the total number of dots) to make it positive. So, the new position = 5 - 9 = -4 + 20 = 16. The item at this position is a Standard Poodle.\n   - Moving 3 steps clockwise from the Standard Poodle: When moving clockwise, we add the number of steps to the current position. So, the new position = 16 + 3 = 19. The item at this position is a chiton.\n   - Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from the chiton: Moving counter-clockwise again, we subtract 7 from the current position (19). If the result is negative, we add 20. So, the new position = 19 - 7 = 12. The item at this position is a disc brake.\n   - Moving 6 steps clockwise from the disc brake: Adding 6 to the current position (12), we get the new position = 12 + 6 = 18.

The item at this position is a traffic light.\n   - Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the traffic light: Moving counter-clockwise means subtracting the number of steps from the current position. If the result is negative, we add 20 to make it positive. So, the new position = 8 - 3 = 5. The item at this position is a great grey owl.\n   - Moving 7 steps clockwise from the great grey owl: Adding 7 to the current position (5), we get the new position = 5 + 7 = 12.
