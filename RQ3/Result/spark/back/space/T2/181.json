We start by understanding that moving around a circular path means we may end up where we started or continue from there based on the number of steps taken relative to the total number of dots.\n\nWe are given a total of 20 dots on the circular map. Starting at the top dot with a bee, and moving clockwise, we have:\n1. modem\n2. upright piano\n3. spaghetti squash\n4. American alligator\n5. Asian elephant\n6. cicada\n7. mink\n8.

So, we land on dot 9, which is \"snail\".\n- Next, moving 10 steps clockwise from \"snail\" (dot 9):\n  Moving clockwise, we add 10 to 9: \\( 9 + 10 = 19 \\). Since the circular path has only 20 dots, and we exceed it, we wrap around by taking modulo 20: \\( 19 \\mod 20 = 19 \\). So, we land on dot 19, which is \"jackfruit\".\n- Then, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise from \"jackfruit\" (dot 19):\n  Moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 9 from 19: \\( 19 - 9 = 10 \\). So, we land on dot 10, which is \"car wheel\".\n- Finally, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from \"car wheel\" (dot 10):\n  Moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 7 from 10: \\( 10 - 7 = 3 \\).
