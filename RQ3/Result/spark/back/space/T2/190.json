Starting from the Afghan Hound (which is the 8th item if we start counting from the tricycle), we need to calculate our final position after moving in a counter-clockwise direction by 13 steps, then 15 steps, then another 13 steps, and finally 8 steps.\n\nLet's break down the movements:\n\n1. **First Movement**: 13 steps counter-clockwise from the Afghan Hound. Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 13 from the current position (8). If the result is negative, we add the total number of dots (20) to wrap around the circle. So, \\( 8 - 13 = -5 \\), adding 20 gives us \\( -5 + 20 = 15 \\). We land on the espresso.\n\n2. **Second Movement**: 15 steps counter-clockwise from the espresso. Again, we subtract 15 from the current position (15). \\( 15 - 15 = 0 \\). This puts us at the tricycle.\n\n3. **Third Movement**: 13 steps counter-clockwise from the tricycle. Subtracting 13 from the current position (0) and adding 20 if necessary, \\( 0 - 13 = -13 \\), which becomes \\( -13 + 20 = 7 \\). We land on the hot dog.\n\n4. **Fourth Movement**: 8 steps counter-clockwise from the hot dog. Subtracting 8 from the current position (7), \\( 7 - 8 = -1 \\), which becomes \\( -1 + 20 = 19 \\). We land on the black-footed ferret.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: black-footed ferret."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
