This means moving past the last dot will take you back to the first dot.\n2. **Clockwise Movement**: When moving clockwise, if you move more than one full circle, the position can be calculated as `(current_position + number_of_steps) % total_number_of_dots`.\n3. **Counter-clockwise Movement**: When moving counter-clockwise, if you move more than one full circle, the position can be calculated as `(current_position - number_of_steps + total_number_of_dots) % total_number_of_dots`.\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n1. **Starting Position**: You start at the reflex camera which is the 5th position (0-indexed).\n2. **First Movement**: Move 6 steps clockwise from the reflex camera.\n   - Calculation: `(5 + 6) % 10 = 11 % 10 = 1`. So, you end up at position 1, which is an ice cream.\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 1 step counter-clockwise from the ice cream.\n   - Calculation: `(1 - 1 + 10) % 10 = 0 % 10 = 0`. So, you end up at position 0, which is a strainer.\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 2 steps clockwise from the strainer.\n   - Calculation: `(0 + 2) % 10 = 2 % 10 = 2`.
