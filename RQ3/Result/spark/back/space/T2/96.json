When moving in a clockwise direction, after reaching the last dot, you loop back to the first dot.\n\n2. **Identifying the Starting Point**: You start from the Afghan Hound, which is one of the items on the path.\n\n3. **Calculating the Steps**: You move 10 steps in a clockwise direction from the starting point (Afghan Hound). Since there are only 10 items on the path, moving 10 steps would mean completing one full round of the circle.\n\n4. **Determining the Final Position**: After completing one full round of the circle, you end up at the same position where you started.
