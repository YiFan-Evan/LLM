We start at the tile roof and move in a counter-clockwise direction first, then clockwise for the subsequent steps.\n\n1. Starting from the tile roof, we move 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Since there are 20 elements, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving \\(20 - 3 = 17\\) steps clockwise (because one full circle is 20 steps). This places us on the holster.\n\n2. From the holster, we move 7 steps in a clockwise direction. Adding these steps to our current position:\n   \\[\n   17 + 7 = 24\n   \\]\n   Since the path is circular with 20 elements, we take modulo 20 of our result:\n   \\[\n   24 \\mod 20 = 4\n   \\]\n   This places us on the lighter.\n\n3. From the lighter, we move 11 steps in a clockwise direction. Adding these steps to our current position:\n   \\[\n   4 + 11 = 15\n   \\]\n   No need to reduce further as it's less than 20. This places us on the ground beetle.\n\n4. From the ground beetle, we move 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to subtracting from our current position:\n   \\[\n   15 - 9 = 6\n   \\]\n   This places us on the tripod.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: tripod."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
