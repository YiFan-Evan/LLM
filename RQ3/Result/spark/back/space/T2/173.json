Since moving CCW decreases the position number, we subtract 6 from 19:\n     \\[\n     19 - 6 = 13\n     \\]\n     So, after this move, we are at the 13th dot, which is the fire salamander.\n\n   - Next, move 2 steps in a clockwise direction from the current position (fire salamander). Moving CW increases the position number, so we add 2 to 13:\n     \\[\n     13 + 2 = 15\n     \\]\n     Now, we are at the 15th dot, which is the teddy bear.\n\n   - Then, move 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the current position (teddy bear). Subtracting 5 from 15:\n     \\[\n     15 - 5 = 10\n     \\]\n     This brings us to the 10th dot, which is the ski.\n\n   - Finally, move 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the current position (ski). Subtracting 10 from 10:\n     \\[\n     10 - 10 = 0\n     \\]\n     Since we are on a circular path with 20 dots, reaching a position less than 1 means we loop back around to the end of the circle. Therefore, 0 corresponds to the last dot on the circular path, which is the fountain.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **fountain**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Since moving CW increases the position number, we add 6 to 18:\n     \\[\n     18 + 6 = 24\n     \\]\n     On a circular path with 20 dots, we need to find the equivalent position by calculating $24 \\mod 20$:\n     \\[\n     24 \\mod 20 = 4\n     \\]\n     Therefore, after this move, we are at the 4th dot, which is the jeep.\n\n   - Next, move 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the current position (jeep).

Adding 10 to 7:\n     \\[\n     7 + 10 = 17\n     \\]\n     Since 17 is less than 20, we remain within the bounds of the circular path.
