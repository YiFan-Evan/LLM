Since there are 10 items, moving 3 steps backwards would land you at the 7th position from the end (counting positions as 1 to 10). This corresponds to the spindle.\n   - From the spindle, moving 1 step clockwise means moving forward to the next position, which is the binoculars.\n   - From the binoculars, moving 8 steps clockwise means moving forward 8 positions.
