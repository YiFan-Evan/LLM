We will number the dots from 1 to 20 starting from the top where the breakwater is located, moving clockwise. Since the bow is on the path, let's identify its position. Assuming the first dot is the breakwater, the bow must be somewhere on the circle.\n\n2. **Position of Bow**: To find the exact position of the bow, let's list out the items until we reach the bow:\n   - Breakwater (1)\n   - Mud turtle (2)\n   - Otter (3)\n   - Bassoon (4)\n   - Broccoli (5)\n   - Scorpion (6)\n   - Folding chair (7)\n   - Mashed potato (8)\n   - Orangutan (9)\n   - Cloak (10)\n   - Cannon (11)\n   - Crate (12)\n   - Dishcloth (13)\n   - Cello (14)\n   - Stone wall (15)\n   - Bow (16)\n   - T-shirt (17)\n   - American bullfrog (18)\n   - Water snake (19)\n   - Parachute (20)\n\n   Therefore, the bow is at position 16.\n\n3. **Calculate Movements**: Now, we move around the ring by various steps in different directions.\n   - Move counter-clockwise by 15 steps from the bow (position 16). Moving counter-clockwise means subtracting 15 from 16: \\( 16 - 15 = 1 \\). This lands us back at the breakwater.\n   - Move clockwise by 16 steps from the breakwater (position 1). Adding 16 to 1: \\( 1 + 16 = 17 \\). Position 17 is the American bullfrog.\n   - Move clockwise by 9 steps from the American bullfrog (position 17). Adding 9 to 17: \\( 17 + 9 = 26 \\). Since the circle has only 20 dots, we take modulo 20: \\( 26 \\mod 20 = 6 \\). Position 6 is the scorpion.\n   - Move clockwise by 6 steps from the scorpion (position 6).
