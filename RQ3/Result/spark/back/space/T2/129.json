This means we are moving right by 19 positions.\n- Next, we move 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. This means we are moving left by 7 positions.\n- Finally, we move 6 steps in a clockwise direction. This means we are moving right by 6 positions.\n\nThe net movement can be calculated by subtracting the total number of counter-clockwise steps from the total number of clockwise steps:\n\\[ \\text{Net Movement} = (19 + 6) - (13 + 7) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Net Movement} = 25 - 20 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Net Movement} = 5 \\]\n\nA positive result indicates movement in the clockwise direction.
