Since there are 20 dots, the new position is \\(0 + 8 = 8\\) modulo 20, which is still 8. So, you end up at the sea slug.\n- **After Second Movement:** Move 15 steps counter-clockwise from position 8. This means moving in the opposite direction for 15 steps. The new position is \\(8 - 15 = -7\\), but since it's a circular path, we add 20 until it fits within the range of 0 to 19. So, \\(-7 + 20 = 13\\). You end up at the killer whale.\n- **After Third Movement:** Move 6 steps counter-clockwise from position 13. The new position is \\(13 - 6 = 7\\). You end up at the manhole cover.\n- **After Fourth Movement:** Move 3 steps counter-clockwise from position 7. The new position is \\(7 - 3 = 4\\).
