This is where modulo arithmetic comes in. If you move m steps counter-clockwise (to the left) on a circle with n elements, it's equivalent to adding n - m steps clockwise (to the right). This is because moving n steps in either direction brings you back to the starting point.\n\n2. **Applying the Moves**: Starting from the traffic light, let's calculate the net effect of all the moves:\n   - First, move 7 steps counter-clockwise. Since we are dealing with a circular path, moving 7 steps to the left is equivalent to moving 20 - 7 = 13 steps to the right.\n   - Then, move 16 steps counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to moving 20 - 16 = 4 steps to the right.\n   - Next, move 1 step counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to moving 20 - 1 = 19 steps to the right.\n   - Finally, move 6 steps clockwise (to the right), which does not change since moving clockwise matches our current direction of counting steps to the right.\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Steps**: Adding up all the effective steps to the right, we have 13 + 4 + 19 + 6 = 42 steps. However, since our circle only has 20 elements, we need to find the remainder when 42 is divided by 20 to determine our final position relative to the starting point. 42 % 20 = 2. This means moving 2 steps to the right from the traffic light.\n\n4. **Identifying the Final Position**: Starting from the traffic light, moving 2 steps to the right leads us to the \"ping-pong ball\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ping-pong ball."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Since we are dealing with a circular path, moving 7 steps to the right is straightforward.\n   - Then, move 16 steps clockwise, which is also straightforward.\n   - Next, move 1 step clockwise, which is straightforward as well.\n   - Finally, move 6 steps counter-clockwise (to the left), which is equivalent to moving 20 - 6 = 14 steps clockwise.\n\n3. **Calculating the Total Steps**: Adding up all the effective steps to the right, we have 7 + 16 + 1 + 14 = 38 steps.
