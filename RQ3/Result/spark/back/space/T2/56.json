If we go past the start or end of the path, we wrap around accordingly.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution\n1. **Initial Position**: Starting from the upright piano.\n2. **First Movement**: Move 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n   - Since there are 10 dots, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the upright piano (7th dot) brings us to the 1st dot.\n3. **Second Movement**: Move 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n   - Moving 3 more steps counter-clockwise from the 1st dot brings us to the 8th dot.\n4. **Third Movement**: Move 4 steps in a clockwise direction.\n   - Moving 4 steps clockwise from the 8th dot brings us to the 2nd dot.\n\n### Final Position\nThe item at the 2nd dot is the Boxer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Boxer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
