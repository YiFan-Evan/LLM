Since the path is circular and consists of 20 elements, we can think of it as being on a number line that wraps around after every 20 steps. This means that if we take more than 20 steps in any direction, we simply subtract or add multiples of 20 to find our new position.\n\nLet's start by assigning each item a number based on its position from the European polecat:\n1. siamang\n2. coho salmon\n3. wolf spider\n4.

Starting from the Beagle (position 14), we need to calculate our final position after moving counter-clockwise by a total of 5 + 18 + 18 + 5 steps.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of steps:\n\\[ 5 + 18 + 18 + 5 = 46 \\]\n\nSince we are moving in a counter-clockwise direction, we subtract these steps from the starting position. However, because the path is circular and consists of 20 elements, we need to account for wrapping around. To do this, we find the remainder when dividing the total number of steps by the number of elements in the path (20).\n\nCalculating the remainder:\n\\[ 46 \\mod 20 = 6 \\]\n\nThis means that after moving 46 steps counter-clockwise from the Beagle, we end up 6 steps counter-clockwise from the Beagle. Since moving counter-clockwise means going backwards, we subtract 6 from the Beagle's position (14):\n\\[ 14 - 6 = 8 \\]\n\nPosition 8 corresponds to the European polecat.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: European polecat."}]
