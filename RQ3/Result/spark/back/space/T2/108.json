Starting from the shield (position 4), you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Since we are counting positions in a circular manner, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from position 4 would take us to position 10 - (7 - 4) = 3. Therefore, after the first movement, you are at position 3, where the saxophone is located.\n\n2. Next, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction from the current position (saxophone at position 3). This takes you to position 2, where the thatched roof is located.\n\n3. Finally, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the current position (thatched roof at position 2). Again, considering the circular nature of the path, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from position 2 would take us to position 10 - (8 - 2) = 4.

Starting from the cock (position 8), you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction. Since we are counting positions in a circular manner, moving 7 steps clockwise from position 8 would take us to position 8 + 7 = 15. However, since there are only 10 positions, we need to wrap around the circle. To find the actual position, we calculate $15 \\mod 10 = 5$. Therefore, after the first movement, you are at position 5, where the shield is located.\n\n2. Next, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction from the current position (shield at position 5). This takes you to position 6, where the Rottweiler is located.\n\n3.

Again, considering the circular nature of the path, moving 8 steps clockwise from position 6 would take us to position 6 + 8 = 14. To find the actual position, we calculate $14 \\mod 10 = 4$.
