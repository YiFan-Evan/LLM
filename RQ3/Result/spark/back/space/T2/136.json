The key is to use modular arithmetic to determine the final position on the path after completing the specified number of steps.\n\n1. **Starting Point:** The starting point is at the golf ball, which is located at the 1st dot (position 1).\n\n2. **Movements:**\n   - Move counter-clockwise by 8 steps.\n   - Move clockwise by 5 steps.\n   - Move clockwise by 16 steps.\n   - Move counter-clockwise by 14 steps.\n\n3. **Calculations:**\n   - Moving counter-clockwise by 8 steps from the 1st dot can be calculated as \\(1 - 8 = -7\\). Since there are only 20 dots, we need to find the equivalent positive position within the range of 1 to 20. Adding 20 to -7 gives us \\(-7 + 20 = 13\\). So, after this move, you're at the 13th dot.\n   - Next, move clockwise by 5 steps from the 13th dot. This means adding 5 to the current position: \\(13 + 5 = 18\\). So, after this move, you're at the 18th dot.\n   - Then, move clockwise by 16 steps from the 18th dot: \\(18 + 16 = 34\\). To find the correct position within the 20 dots, take modulo 20: \\(34 \\mod 20 = 14\\). So, after this move, you're at the 14th dot.\n   - Finally, move counter-clockwise by 14 steps from the 14th dot: \\(14 - 14 = 0\\). Again, adjusting for the circular nature of the path and ensuring the position is within the range of 1 to 20: \\(0 + 20 = 20\\). However, since we start counting from 1, we adjust it to \\(20 \\mod 20 = 0\\) plus 1 to convert it back to a 1-based index: \\(0 + 1 = 1\\). So, after this last move, you're back at the 1st dot.\n\n4. **Final Position:** After all moves, you end up at the 1st dot again, where you started with the golf ball.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **golf ball**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
