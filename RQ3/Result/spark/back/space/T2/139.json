We're given a starting position at the African bush elephant and asked to make two movements: 6 steps counter-clockwise and then 14 steps counter-clockwise from our new position after the first movement.\n\nThe fundamental principle involved here is understanding that moving around a circular path means that once you pass the last item, you loop back to the first item. This concept is similar to modulo arithmetic, where if you add or subtract more than the total number of elements, you start over from the beginning.\n\nGiven there are 20 items on the path (including the hard disk drive), when you move counter-clockwise by 6 steps from the African bush elephant, you essentially add 20 - 6 = 14 steps in a clockwise direction since moving counter-clockwise 6 steps is equivalent to moving clockwise 14 steps (as one full circle is 20 steps).\n\nAfter completing the first movement, you are now 14 steps away clockwise from the African bush elephant. Next, you move an additional 14 steps in the counter-clockwise direction. Since moving counter-clockwise 14 steps is equivalent to moving clockwise 6 steps (because 20 - 14 = 6), we add these 6 steps to the current position relative to the African bush elephant.\n\nAdding 14 (from the first movement) + 6 (from the second movement) = 20 steps in total, which means you have completed one full circle and end up back at the starting point, which is the African bush elephant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **African bush elephant**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
