From the description given, the umbrella is the second item on the path.\n\n3. **Movement Details**: You move 10 steps in a clockwise direction from the umbrella. Since there are only 10 items, moving 10 steps around the circular path means completing one full loop around the circle.\n\n4. **Calculating the End Point**: Starting from the umbrella (second item), moving clockwise by 10 steps completes one full circle back to the starting point.
