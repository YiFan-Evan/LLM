To do this, we use modulo arithmetic:\n\\[ \\text{New position} = (6 - 1) \\mod 5 + 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New position} = 5 \\mod 5 + 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New position} = 0 + 1 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New position} = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, after moving 3 steps in a clockwise direction from the pencil sharpener, you will find yourself at the tram again.\n\nMoving once more around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction from the new position (1):\n\\[ \\text{New position} = (1 + 3) \\mod 5 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New position} = 4 \\mod 5 \\]\n\\[ \\text{New position} = 4 \\]\n\nSo, after the second movement, you will be at position 4, which corresponds to the paddle wheel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: paddle wheel."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
