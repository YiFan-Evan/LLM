The key principles involved are:\n\n1. **Circular Path Movement**: When moving in a circular path, if you move a certain number of steps forward (clockwise) or backward (counter-clockwise), your final position depends on the number of steps moved and the total number of elements in the circle.\n2. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the path is circular and has a fixed number of elements (20 in this case), moving more than the number of elements results in a wrap-around effect. This is mathematically handled using modulo operation.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to solve the problem step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Starting Point\nThe starting point is the microwave oven, which is the 5th element from the Basenji (starting at the top of the path).\n\n### Step 2: First Movement (Clockwise)\nFrom the microwave oven, you move 5 steps clockwise.

Moving counter-clockwise means subtracting the steps from the current position index.\n\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = (10 - 3) \\mod 20 = 7 \\]\n\nThe 7th element is a maze.\n\n### Step 4: Third Movement (Clockwise)\nThen, you move 5 steps clockwise from the maze.\n\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = (7 + 5) \\mod 20 = 12 \\]\n\nThe 12th element is a strawberry.\n\n### Step 5: Fourth Movement (Clockwise)\nFinally, you move 3 steps clockwise from the strawberry.\n\n\\[ \\text{New Position} = (12 + 3) \\mod 20 = 15 \\]\n\nThe 15th element is a common squirrel monkey.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: common squirrel monkey."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
