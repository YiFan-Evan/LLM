The number of steps indicates how many positions you move from your current location.\n\n2. **Starting Point**: We start at the four-poster bed, which is located at the top of the circle. From here, the elements in a clockwise direction are: French horn, perfume, strainer, ruffed grouse, and then back to the four-poster bed to complete the circle.\n\n3. **Counter-Clockwise Movement**: Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the four-poster bed (our starting point), we go backwards two positions. Since going counter-clockwise takes us back through the circle, we count backwards: one step back from the four-poster bed would be the ruffed grouse, and two steps back lands us on the strainer.\n\n4. **Clockwise Movement**: Next, we move 3 steps in a clockwise direction from our new position (the strainer). Moving clockwise from the strainer, the next items are: ruffed grouse, four-poster bed, French horn, and then perfume.
