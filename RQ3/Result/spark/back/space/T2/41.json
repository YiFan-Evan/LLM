This means that moving past the last dot will loop us back to the first dot.\n2. **Clockwise and Counter-clockwise Movement**: Moving clockwise means advancing forward on the path, while moving counter-clockwise means going backward on the path.\n3. **Modulo Arithmetic**: Since the path is circular, the effective number of steps taken can be calculated using modulo operation (`%`).\n\n### Steps to Solve:\n\n1. **Identify Starting Position**: You start at the Kuvasz which is the 4th item from the bittern (starting point) when moving clockwise.\n   \n2. **Movements**:\n   - Move 4 steps clockwise from Kuvasz.\n   - Move 8 steps counter-clockwise from the new position.\n   - Move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the new position.\n\n3. **Calculate Effective Steps**:\n   - First move: Starting from Kuvasz, you move 4 steps clockwise.\n     - Kuvasz \u2192 candle \u2192 grocery store \u2192 hockey puck \u2192 swimming cap (4th step)\n   - Second move: From swimming cap, move 8 steps counter-clockwise.\n     - Swimming cap \u2192 hockey puck \u2192 grocery store \u2192 candle \u2192 suit \u2192 scabbard \u2192 bittern \u2192 dowitcher \u2192 beaver \u2192 Kuvasz \u2192 (7th step)\n     - Note: We use modulo 10 for the steps since it's a circular path.
