However, it contains a mistake that prevents it from working correctly. The issue lies in the swapping logic inside the nested while loop.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how selection sort works:\n1. Start with the first element of the array and assume it is the smallest.\n2. Compare this element with all other elements in the array to find the actual smallest element.\n3. Swap the smallest element found with the first element.\n4. Move to the next element and repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.\n\nIn the provided code, the swapping logic is incorrect because it swaps elements even when `arr[z]` is not smaller than `arr[t]`. This results in unnecessary swaps and incorrect sorting.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the selection sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Assume the minimum is the first element\n        min_index = i\n        # Test against elements after i to find the smallest\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element\n        if min_index != i:\n            arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Corrected Code:\n1. **Outer Loop (`for i in range(n)`):** Iterates over each element in the array.\n2. **Assumption (`min_index = i`):** Assumes the current position `i` holds the smallest value.\n3. **Inner Loop (`for j in range(i + 1, n)`):** Compares the assumed smallest value with every other element in the array to find the actual smallest value.\n4. **Swapping (`if min_index != i`):** If a smaller element is found, it updates `min_index`. After the inner loop completes, it swaps the smallest element found with the element at position `i`.\n5. **Return Statement:** Returns the sorted array.\n\nThis corrected version ensures that only necessary swaps are performed, resulting in a properly sorted array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[t]:\n                temp = arr[t]\n                arr[t] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code for the `selection_sort` function contains several issues that prevent it from working correctly.
