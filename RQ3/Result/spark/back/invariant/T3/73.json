The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

However, there are a couple of issues with the code that need to be addressed:\n\n1. The variable `i` is used but not defined within the loop. It should be replaced with `n`, which is the loop counter.\n2. The function should return `-1` if the target is not found in the array.\n\nHere's the corrected version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef give_id(arr, target):\n    id_value = -1\n    n = 0\n    while n < len(arr):\n        if arr[n] == target:\n            id_value = n\n        n += 1\n    return id_value\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `id_value` is initialized to `-1` to indicate that the target has not been found by default.\n   - `n` is initialized to `0` and will be used as the loop counter.\n\n2. **Loop**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `n` is less than the length of the array `arr`.\n   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[n]` is equal to the `target`.\n   - If they are equal, `id_value` is updated to `n`, which is the current index.\n   - The loop counter `n` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - After the loop completes, the function returns `id_value`. If the target was found, `id_value` will be its index; otherwise, it will remain `-1`.\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```python\narr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]\ntarget = 30\nprint(give_id(arr, target))  # Output: 2\n\ntarget = 60\nprint(give_id(arr, target))  # Output: -1\n```\n\nIn this example, the function correctly finds the index of `30` in the array and returns `2`.
