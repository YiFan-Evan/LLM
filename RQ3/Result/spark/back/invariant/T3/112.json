This serves as a default value if the `id` is not found within the bounds of the array.\n2. **Looping through the array**: A `while` loop is used to iterate over the array. The loop continues until `m` is less than the length of the array.\n3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, there's a condition to check if the current index `m` matches the given `id`. If it does, `member_value` is updated to the value at that index.\n4. **Incrementing the Index**: The index `m` is incremented by 1 in each iteration.\n5. **Return Value**: After the loop completes, the function returns `member_value`.\n\n### Issues with the Current Implementation:\n- **Efficiency**: The loop continues even after finding the desired element, which is unnecessary.\n- **Boundary Check**: There's no check to ensure that `id` is within the valid range of the array indices.\n\n### Optimized Version:\nHere\u2019s an optimized version of the function that addresses these issues:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    # Check if id is within the valid range\n    if id < 0 or id >= len(arr):\n        return -1\n    \n    # Return the value at the specified index\n    return arr[id]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Boundary Check**: Before accessing the array, we check if `id` is within the valid range of indices for the array.
