However, it contains a mistake that prevents it from working correctly. The issue lies in the swapping logic inside the nested loop. Let's break down the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem and then provide the corrected version of the code.\n\n### Fundamental Principles of Selection Sort:\n1. **Initialization**: Start with the first element of the array.\n2. **Finding the Minimum**: For each position `q`, find the smallest element in the subarray starting from `q` to the end of the array.\n3. **Swapping**: Swap the found minimum element with the element at position `q`.\n4. **Repeat**: Move to the next position and repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.\n\n### Issues in the Provided Code:\n- The swapping logic is incorrect. It should swap the elements at positions `q` and `z`, but instead, it swaps `arr[q]` and `arr[z]` multiple times within the inner loop, which leads to incorrect sorting.\n\n### Corrected Code:\nHere's the corrected version of the selection sort algorithm:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for q in range(n - 1):\n        min_index = q\n        for z in range(q + 1, n):\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = z\n        if min_index != q:\n            arr[q], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[q]\n    return arr\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Corrected Code:\n1. **Outer Loop (`for q in range(n - 1)`)**: This loop iterates over each element in the array except the last one since the last element will already be in its correct position after the previous iterations.\n2. **Inner Loop (`for z in range(q + 1, n)`)**: This loop finds the index of the smallest element in the subarray starting from `q + 1` to the end of the array.\n3. **Swapping**: After finding the minimum element in the subarray, we swap it with the element at position `q` if `min_index` is different from `q`.\n\n### Loop Invariant:\nFor each iteration `i` of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted, and the remaining subarray `arr[i:n]` contains the smallest unsorted element at its beginning.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for q in range(n - 1):\n        min_index = q\n        for z in range(q + 1, n):\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = z\n        if min_index != q:\n            arr[q], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[q]\n    return arr\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    while q <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = q + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[q]:\n                temp = arr[q]\n                arr[q] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code is an implementation of the selection sort algorithm.
