This variable will hold the cumulative sum of the elements in the array.\n   - `h` is initialized to 0.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `sum_value` is initialized to 0. This variable will hold the cumulative sum of the elements in the array.\n   - `h` is initialized to 0. This variable serves as the index for iterating through the array.\n\n2. **Loop**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `h` is less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`. This condition ensures that the loop iterates over each element in the array.\n   - In each iteration, the element at index `h` of the array (`arr[h]`) is added to `sum_value`.\n   - The index `h` is then incremented by 1.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - Once the loop completes (i.e., when `h` exceeds `len(arr) - 1`), the function returns `sum_value`, which now contains the total sum of all elements in the array.\n\nHere's the code again for clarity:\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        sum_value += arr[h]\n        h += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nIf you call `give_sum([1, 2, 3, 4])`, the function will work as follows:\n\n- Initialize `sum_value` to 0 and `h` to 0.\n- First iteration: `sum_value += arr[0]` \u2192 `sum_value = 0 + 1 = 1`, `h = 1`\n- Second iteration: `sum_value += arr[1]` \u2192 `sum_value = 1 + 2 = 3`, `h = 2`\n- Third iteration: `sum_value += arr[2]` \u2192 `sum_value = 3 + 3 = 6`, `h = 3`\n- Fourth iteration: `sum_value += arr[3]` \u2192 `sum_value = 6 + 4 = 10`, `h = 4`\n- Loop ends because `h` is no longer less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1` (which is 3).\n- Return `sum_value`, which is 10.\n\nThis function correctly computes the sum of the elements in the list."}]
