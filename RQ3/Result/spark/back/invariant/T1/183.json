However, it contains a mistake that prevents it from working correctly. The issue lies in the swapping logic inside the nested loop.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how selection sort works:\n1. Iterate over each element in the array.\n2. For each element, find the smallest element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array.\n3. Swap the found smallest element with the current element.\n4. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.\n\nIn the provided code, the swapping logic is incorrect because it swaps elements even when `arr[z]` is not smaller than `arr[d]`.
