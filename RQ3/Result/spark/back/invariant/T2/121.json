[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first explain the fundamental principles involved in solving it, and then provide the answer to the problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    b = 0\n    while 2 * b < len(arr):\n        mid_value = arr[b]\n        b += 1\n    return mid_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The function `give_mid` is designed to find and return the middle value of an array.
