This is inefficient because we already know the position of the element once it's found.\n2. **Initialization of `member_value`**: The initial value of `member_value` is set to -1, which might not be appropriate if the array contains negative values or if the index is out of bounds.\n3. **Index Out of Bounds**: There is no check to ensure that the provided `id` is within the valid range of the array indices.\n\n### Improved Version:\nHere\u2019s a more efficient and robust version of the function:\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    # Check if the id is within the valid range\n    if id < 0 or id >= len(arr):\n        return None  # or raise an exception, depending on your use case\n    \n    return arr[id]\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Range Check**: Before accessing the array, the function checks if the `id` is within the valid range of indices.
