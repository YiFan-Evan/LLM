If the target value is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns -1.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - `id_value` is initialized to -1. This will be the default return value if the target is not found in the array.\n   - `i` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used as the loop counter to traverse the array.\n\n2. **Loop through the array**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `i` is less than the length of the array (`len(arr)`).\n   - Inside the loop, there is a conditional statement that checks if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the target value.\n     - If `arr[i] == target`, then `id_value` is updated to the current index `i`.\n   - After checking the condition, `i` is incremented by 1 to move to the next element in the array.\n\n3. **Return the result**:\n   - Once the loop completes, the function returns `id_value`. If the target was found during the iterations, `id_value` will hold the index of the target.
