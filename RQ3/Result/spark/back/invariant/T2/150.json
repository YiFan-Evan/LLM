This variable will hold the cumulative sum of the elements in the array.\n   - `k` is initialized to 0.

Let's break down how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - `sum_value` is initialized to 0. This variable will hold the cumulative sum of the elements in the array.\n   - `k` is initialized to -1. This variable serves as the index for iterating through the array.\n\n2. **Loop**:\n   - The `while` loop runs as long as `k` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. This condition ensures that `k` will eventually reach the last index of the array (`len(arr) - 1`).\n   - In each iteration, `k` is incremented by 1 (`k += 1`), and the element at index `k` of the array (`arr[k]`) is added to `sum_value`.\n\n3. **Return**:\n   - Once the loop completes (i.e., when `k` equals `len(arr) - 1`), the function returns `sum_value`, which now contains the total sum of all elements in the array.\n\nHere's the code again for reference:\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    k = -1\n    while k < len(arr) - 1:\n        k += 1\n        sum_value += arr[k]\n    return sum_value\n```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nIf you call `give_sum([1, 2, 3, 4])`, the function will work as follows:\n\n- Initialize `sum_value` to 0 and `k` to -1.\n- First iteration: `k` becomes 0, `sum_value` becomes 0 + 1 = 1.\n- Second iteration: `k` becomes 1, `sum_value` becomes 1 + 2 = 3.\n- Third iteration: `k` becomes 2, `sum_value` becomes 3 + 3 = 6.\n- Fourth iteration: `k` becomes 3, `sum_value` becomes 6 + 4 = 10.\n- The loop exits because `k` is no longer less than `len(arr) - 1`.\n- The function returns `sum_value`, which is 10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```python\nprint(give_sum([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 10\n```\n\nThis function correctly computes the sum of the elements in the array."}]
