Let's analyze each premise and see how they connect to form a chain leading to the desired conclusion.\n\n1. Start with premise (12): Fae is a grimpus.\n2. From premise (5), we know that everything that is transparent or opaque or a grimpus is a zumpus. Since Fae is a grimpus, it follows that Fae is a zumpus.\n3. Premise (6) states that everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus. We need to show that Fae can be categorized as one of these three: luminous, metallic, or a yumpus.\n4. To link Fae to being a yumpus, we need to find a connection between the properties of Fae and the properties of a yumpus. Premise (1) states that everything that is large, small, or a yumpus is a wumpus. However, there's no direct information about Fae being large or small.\n5. Premise (4) states that everything that is kind, angry, or a grimpus is a yumpus. Since Fae is a grimpus (from step 1), it follows that Fae is also a yumpus.\n6. Now that we have established that Fae is a yumpus, we can use premise (6) again to conclude that Fae is also a vumpus because everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (12),(5),(4),(6)->(14)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
