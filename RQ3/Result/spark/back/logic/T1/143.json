Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

For example, \"Everything that is X and Y is Z\" means if something has both property X and Y, then it must also have property Z.\n2. **Chain of Implications**: Often, multiple premises need to be chained together to derive a new conclusion. This involves identifying intermediate properties that can bridge the gap between the known properties and the desired conclusion.\n3. **Conjunction of Properties**: Some premises require conjunctions of properties (e.g., \"opaque and rompus\"). These conjunctions must be explicitly stated or derived from other premises.\n4. **Direct and Indirect Use**: Some premises might not directly mention the properties in question but can still be useful through intermediate steps.\n\n### Analysis and Derivation\nLet's break down the given premises and see how they can be used to prove the conclusion:\n\n1. **Premise Relevance**:\n   - We need to prove that Sally is \"opaque and a rompus\".\n   - From premise (12), we know Sally is opaque.\n   - To prove she is a rompus, we need to find a path that leads to this conclusion.\n\n2. **Chaining Premises**:\n   - Premise (8) states: \"Everything that is wooden and a numpus is a rompus.\"\n   - From premise (14), we know Sally is wooden.\n   - From premise (15), we know Sally is a numpus.\n   - Combining these, we can infer that Sally is a rompus.\n\n3. **Combining Results**:\n   - Since Sally is opaque (from premise 12) and we just proved she is a rompus, we can now state that Sally is \"opaque and a rompus\".\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises\nThe minimal set of premises needed to derive the conclusion is:\n- Premise (8): Everything that is wooden and a numpus is a rompus.\n- Premise (12): Sally is opaque.\n- Premise (14): Sally is wooden.\n- Premise (15): Sally is a numpus.\n\nThese four premises are sufficient to prove that Sally is opaque and a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(8),(12),(14),(15)->(20)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
