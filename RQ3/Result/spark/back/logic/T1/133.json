Resolution involves taking two clauses with opposite literals and replacing them with their resolved form. Here's how we can proceed:\n\n1. Start by assuming that Polly is a vumpus.\n2. Use this assumption along with the given premises to derive a contradiction.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n- Assume: (A) Polly is a vumpus.\n- From premise (1): Everything that is a vumpus, a jompus, or a dumpus is a rompus. Since Polly is a vumpus, she must be a rompus.\n  - (B) Polly is a rompus.\n\nNow, let's consider the other premises:\n\n- From premise (3): Everything that is a vumpus or a jompus or a dumpus is a zumpus. Since Polly is a vumpus, she must also be a zumpus.\n  - (C) Polly is a zumpus.\n\n- From premise (7): Each zumpus is a rompus. This confirms our earlier conclusion that Polly is a rompus.\n  - (D) Polly is a rompus.\n\n- From premise (5): Polly is a zumpus. This is consistent with our previous conclusion.\n  - (E) Polly is a zumpus.\n\n- From premise (10): Polly is a lempus, an impus, and a gorpus.\n  - (F) Polly is a lempus.\n  - (G) Polly is an impus.\n  - (H) Polly is a gorpus.\n\n- From premise (6): Tumpuses are impuses. Since Polly is an impus, if she were a tumpus, this would be consistent. However, we don't have direct information about Polly being a tumpus.\n\n- From premise (11): Polly is a tumpus, a lorpus, and a wumpus.\n  - (I) Polly is a tumpus.\n  - (J) Polly is a lorpus.\n  - (K) Polly is a wumpus.\n\n- From premise (9): Each lorpus is a lempus. Since Polly is a lorpus, she must also be a lempus.\n  - (L) Polly is a lempus.\n\n- From premise (4): Every wumpus is a grimpus. Since Polly is a wumpus, she must also be a grimpus.\n  - (M) Polly is a grimpus.\n\nNow, let's combine these conclusions to see if we can derive a contradiction:\n\n- From (F) and (L), both stating that Polly is a lempus, we have consistency.\n- From (I), (J), and (K), all stating different characteristics of Polly, there's no immediate contradiction here.\n- From (M), Polly being a grimpus, there's no contradiction either.\n\nHowever, we need to find a contradiction with the initial assumption that Polly is a vumpus. Let's revisit the premises and conclusions:\n\n- Premise (8) states that lorpuses are not rompuses. Since Polly is not a lorpus (from J), this doesn't directly apply.\n- The only potential contradiction could come from re-examining the premises in relation to each other, but none of the premises directly contradict the assumption that Polly is a vumpus.\n\nGiven the information provided, there seems to be no direct contradiction derived from the assumption that Polly is a vumpus.

We will use a process of elimination and contradiction to show that if Polly were a vumpus, it would lead to a contradiction with the given premises.\n\n### Step-by-Step Proof\n\n1. **Assume Polly is a vumpus**: \n   - This means Polly satisfies the condition of being a vumpus.\n\n2. **Use Premise (3)**:\n   - Premise (3): Everything that is a vumpus or a jompus or a dumpus is a zumpus.\n   - Since Polly is a vumpus, by premise (3), Polly must be a zumpus.\n\n3. **Use Premise (7)**:\n   - Premise (7): Each zumpus is a rompus.\n   - Since Polly is a zumpus, by premise (7), Polly must be a rompus.\n\n4. **Use Premise (1)**:\n   - Premise (1): Every mother has a son.\n   - This premise does not directly relate to Polly's characteristics but is irrelevant to the current proof.\n\n5. **Use Premise (2)**:\n   - Premise (2): Everything that is a vumpus or a sterpus or an impus is a zumpus.\n   - Since Polly is a vumpus, by premise (2), Polly must be a zumpus.\n\n6. **Combine Premises (2) and (3)**:\n   - Both premises (2) and (3) conclude that Polly is a zumpus if she is a vumpus. This is consistent and does not provide any contradiction yet.\n\n7. **Use Premise (5)**:\n   - Premise (5): Polly is a zumpus.\n   - This premise directly states that Polly is a zumpus, which aligns with our assumption that Polly is a vumpus.\n\n8. **Use Premise (6)**:\n   - Premise (6): Tumpuses are impuses.\n   - This premise states that if something is a tumpus, it is also an impus. This does not directly relate to Polly being a vumpus but will be useful later.\n\n9. **Use Premise (10)**:\n   - Premise (10): Polly is a lempus, an impus, and a gorpus.\n   - Since Polly is an impus, this aligns with premise (6) and does not contradict our assumption.\n\n10. **Use Premise (11)**:\n    - Premise (11): Polly is a tumpus, a lorpus, and a wumpus.\n    - Since Polly is a tumpus, by premise (6), Polly is also an impus. This is consistent with premise (10).\n\n11. **Use Premise (9)**:\n    - Premise (9): Each lorpus is a lempus.\n    - Since Polly is a lorpus, by premise (9), Polly is also a lempus. This is consistent with premise (10).\n\n12. **Use Premise (4)**:\n    - Premise (4): Every wumpus is a grimpus.\n    - Since Polly is a wumpus, by premise (11), Polly must be a grimpus.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven all the premises and the assumption that Polly is a vumpus, we have consistently shown that Polly being a vumpus leads to her being a zumpus and a rompus. However, no contradiction arises from these conclusions. Therefore, based on the given premises, there is no direct evidence to prove that Polly is not a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **There is no contradiction derived from the assumption that Polly is a vumpus, thus it cannot be proven that Polly is not a vumpus based on the given premises.**"}]
