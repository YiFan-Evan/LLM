We need to derive proposition (14) from the given premises by applying the rules of logic.\n\nThe fundamental principles involved in solving these kinds of problems are:\n\n1. **Conjunction**: If we have a statement \"A and B,\" it means both A and B are true.\n2. **Disjunction**: If we have a statement \"A or B,\" it means at least one of A or B is true.\n3. **Implication**: If we have a statement \"If A then B,\" it can be rewritten as \"Not B implies Not A.\"\n4. **Universal Quantification**: If we have a statement \"For all X, P(X),\" it means that for every instance of X, P(X) is true.\n5. **Existential Quantification**: If we have a statement \"There exists an X such that P(X),\" it means that there is at least one instance of X for which P(X) is true.\n\nGiven the premises, we need to find a minimal set of them that will allow us to prove the conclusion (14).
