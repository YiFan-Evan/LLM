The proof obligation is that Fae is a shumpus.\n\nLet's analyze the given premises:\n\n1. Every mother has a son. (This premise is irrelevant to the proof obligation.)\n2. Every vumpus is sunny and a sterpus. (This premise is irrelevant to the proof obligation.)\n3. Each tumpus is a zumpus and a jompus. (This premise is irrelevant to the proof obligation.)\n4. Each grimpus is a tumpus and a shumpus. (This premise is relevant because it connects grimpus to shumpus.)\n5. Shumpuses are gorpuses and lempuses. (This premise is relevant because it defines what shumpuses are.)\n6. Every wumpus is a brimpus and a grimpus. (This premise is relevant because it connects wumpus to grimpus.)\n7. Every brimpus is a rompus and a lorpus. (This premise is irrelevant to the proof obligation.)\n8. Fae is an impus and a numpus. (This premise is irrelevant to the proof obligation.)\n9. Fae is a tumpus and a grimpus. (This premise is relevant because it states that Fae is a tumpus and a grimpus.)\n\nNow, let's construct the proof:\n\nFrom premise (9), we know that Fae is a tumpus and a grimpus.\nFrom premise (4), we know that each grimpus is a shumpus.\nSince Fae is a grimpus (from premise (9)), it follows that Fae is also a shumpus (from premise (4)).\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises that can be used to prove that Fae is a shumpus is {(4), (9)}.\n\nThe final answer is: (4),(9)->(10)."}]
