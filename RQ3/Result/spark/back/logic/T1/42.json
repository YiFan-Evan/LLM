Therefore, by premise (2), we can conclude that Polly is a lempus.\n\nNext, we need to show that Polly is both dull and bright. This is straightforward because we have direct information from the premises:\n- Polly is dull (13)\n- Polly is bright (11)\n\nSince Polly is already identified as a lempus and we have established that she is both dull and bright, we can combine these facts to conclude that Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise numbers required to derive the proof obligation is:\n(2),(8),(10),(13),(11),(15)->(16)\n\nHowever, since the problem asks for the minimal set of premises, we can further refine it by noting that premise (2) alone connects Polly being sweet, spicy, and a rompus with being a lempus.
