From premise (1), we know that wumpuses are opaque and lempuses. Since Wren is an opaque lempus, this means Wren can be classified as a wumpus based on this property.\n3. Now, using the classification of Wren as a wumpus from step 2, we look at premise (7), which tells us every wumpus is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus. This confirms that Wren is also sunny, a sterpus, and an impus.\n4. With Wren confirmed as a sterpus and an impus, we move to premise (10), which states Wren is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus. This matches our current understanding of Wren's properties, reinforcing the classification without adding new information.\n5. Next, we need to connect Wren's properties to those of a brimpus. We notice that being a sterpus and an impus aligns with the properties described for wumpuses in premise (7). However, we need to find a direct connection to brimpuses. Looking at premise (2), each grimpus is feisty and a shumpus and a rompus. Since Wren is already established as a grimpus, this adds the properties of being feisty, a shumpus, and a rompus to Wren's profile.\n6. To directly link Wren to being a brimpus, we refer to premise (4), which states that lempuses are spicy and brimpuses and grimpuses. Since Wren is already identified as a lempus and a grimpus, this premise directly implies that Wren is also a brimpus.\n\nTherefore, by following the chain of logical deductions through the given premises, we have shown that Wren possesses all the properties of a brimpus.
