From (1), we know that Lempuses are Wumpuses.\n2. From (2), we know that Sally is a Lempus.\n3. From (7), we know that Brimpuses are Lempuses.\n4. From (6), we know that Each Brimpus is a Rompus.\n5.

From (10), we know that Sally is a Vumpus, Sally is not a Wumpus, and Sally is a Brimpus.\n9. From (5), we know that Vumpuses are Numpuses.\n\nNow, let's combine these premises step-by-step to reach the conclusion:\n\n**Step 1:** Sally is a Lempus (from (2)).\n**Step 2:** Since Sally is a Lempus, she must be a Wumpus (from (1)).\n**Step 3:** However, we also know that Sally is not a Wumpus (from (10)). This creates a contradiction with Step 2.

To resolve this contradiction, we must find an alternative explanation for why Sally cannot be a wumpus despite being a lempus. One possible explanation is that Sally cannot be a shumpus because if she were, she would also be a wumpus due to premise (4).\n5. If Sally were a shumpus, then by premise (4), she would be a brimpus, an impus, and a wumpus.\n6. But we already know from premise (10) that Sally is a brimpus.
