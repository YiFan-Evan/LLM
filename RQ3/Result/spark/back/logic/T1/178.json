Fae is a lorpus (premise 23).\n2. Fae is a jompus (premise 24).\n\nNext, we need to find a path from these properties to the conclusion that Fae is not sunny. We can use the following chain of reasoning:\n\n- From premise 16, we know that each lorpus is a lempus. Since Fae is a lorpus (premise 23), it follows that Fae is a lempus.\n- From premise 20, we know that impuses are rompuses. Although Fae is not directly identified as an impus, we can use other relationships to link back to impuses.\n- From premise 19, we know that Grimpuses are jompuses. Since Fae is a jompus (premise 24), if Fae were a Grimpus, this would connect Fae to being a jompus.\n- From premise 9, we know that Grimpuses are numpuses. Combining this with the previous step, if Fae were a Grimpus, then Fae would also be a numpus.\n- From premise 14, we know that Numpuses are not opaque. This tells us something about numpuses but doesn't directly help with proving that Fae is not sunny.\n- From premise 15, we know that every yumpus is a sterpus. However, there's no direct connection between yumpuses and Fae or being not sunny.\n- From premise 7, we know that each impus is not sunny. If we can link Fae to being an impus, we can conclude that Fae is not sunny.\n\nNow, let's combine these steps:\n\n- Since Fae is a jompus (premise 24), and every jompus is a shumpus (premise 13), Fae is a shumpus.\n- Since Fae is a shumpus and impuses are rompuses (premise 20), and rompuses are dull (premise 5), this indirectly links Fae to being a rompus through the chain of jompus -> shumpus -> rompus.\n- Finally, since each impus is not sunny (premise 7), and we've established that Fae is linked to being a rompus (and thus an impus through the chain), we can conclude that Fae is not sunny.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises that leads to the conclusion that Fae is not sunny is:\n\n(7),(20),(5),(13),(24)->(25)\n\nThis set of premises establishes the necessary chain of logic to prove that Fae is not sunny."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
