The fundamental principles involved in solving this type of problem include:\n\n- Understanding the structure of the propositions and how they relate to each other.\n- Identifying which premises are relevant to the proof obligation.\n- Applying the rules of logical deduction to combine these premises in a way that leads to the desired conclusion.\n\nLet's go through the steps:\n\n1. We start with the proof obligation (17): \"Sam is dull and a shumpus.\"\n2. To prove this, we need to find a chain of premises that leads us to this conclusion.\n3. From the given premises, we see that (16) directly states \"Sam is dull.\"\n4. Now, we need to find a connection between Sam and being a \"shumpus.\"\n5. Premise (13) states that \"Sam is snowy.\"\n6. Premise (7) states that \"Everything that is snowy and a tumpus is a shumpus.\"\n7. Premise (15) states that \"Sam is a tumpus.\"\n8. Combining (13), (15), and (7), we can deduce that \"Sam is a shumpus.\"\n9.
