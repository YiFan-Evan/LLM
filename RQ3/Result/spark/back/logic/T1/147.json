We'll start by analyzing the given propositions and their relationships.\n\nThe goal is to prove that \"Max is metallic and a shumpus\" (proposition 16). Let's break down the relevant information:\n\n1. Max is a wumpus (8).\n2. Max is happy (9).\n3. Max is metallic (10).\n4. Max is bitter (11).\n5. Max is a tumpus (12).\n6. Max is snowy (13).\n7.

Since Max is happy (9) and a wumpus (8), we can conclude that Max is a shumpus.\n\n- Proposition (7) states that everything that is metallic and a shumpus is a grimpus. Since Max is metallic (10) and a shumpus (from the previous step), we can conclude that Max is a grimpus.\n\nHowever, the goal is to prove that Max is \"metallic and a shumpus,\" not \"a grimpus.\" The mistake here was in jumping to a conclusion about being a grimpus instead of focusing on proving the specific combination required.\n\nLet's correct our approach:\n\n- We already established that Max is a shumpus from premises (1), (8), and (9).\n- We also know that Max is metallic from premise (10).\n\nSince we need to show that Max is both metallic and a shumpus, and we have established both facts independently, the minimal set of premises needed to prove this is:\n\n- Premise (8): Max is a wumpus.\n- Premise (9): Max is happy.\n- Premise (10): Max is metallic.\n\nThese three premises directly lead to the conclusion that Max is metallic and a shumpus, satisfying the proof obligation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(8),(9),(10)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
