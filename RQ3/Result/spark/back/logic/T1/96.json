Here, we see that Fae's being luminous, wooden, and liquid are directly stated in premises (20), (21), and (17). Additionally, Fae being a zumpus is stated in premise (19).\n\n2. **Chain of Reasoning**: Next, we look for connections between these characteristics and how they might lead to Fae being identified as a 'dumpus'. The connection here seems to be through the combination of characteristics that match the definition of a 'dumpus'.\n\n3. **Finding Intermediate Conclusions**: We need to find if there are any intermediate conclusions that can be drawn from the given premises which help us link Fae's characteristics to being a 'dumpus'. In this case, premise (9) states that everything that is amenable, aggressive, mean, and a zumpus is a dumpus. Since Fae is already identified as mean (14), aggressive (15), a zumpus (19), and amenable (18), this directly matches the criteria in premise (9).\n\n4. **Formulating the Proof**: With this information, we can formulate a proof that connects all these dots. Fae being luminous, wooden, and liquid directly matches with premises (20), (21), and (17). Additionally, Fae being a zumpus along with being amenable, aggressive, and mean matches with premise (9), leading to the conclusion that Fae is a dumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (17),(18),(19),(20),(21),(9),(14),(15)->(22).

Let's break down the relevant premises step by step:\n\n1. **Premises about Fae's characteristics**:\n   - Fae is small (premise 12).\n   - Fae is large (premise 13).\n   - Fae is mean (premise 14).\n   - Fae is aggressive (premise 15).\n   - Fae is a wumpus (premise 16).\n   - Fae is liquid (premise 17).\n   - Fae is amenable (premise 18).\n   - Fae is a zumpus (premise 19).\n   - Fae is luminous (premise 20).\n   - Fae is wooden (premise 21).\n\n2. **Relevant definitions**:\n   - Everything that is amenable, aggressive, mean, and a zumpus is a dumpus (premise 9).\n\n3. **Proof steps**:\n   - From premises 14, 15, 18, and 19, we can deduce that Fae is amenable, aggressive, mean, and a zumpus. According to premise 9, this combination implies that Fae is a dumpus.\n   - Fae is already described as luminous (premise 20) and wooden (premise 21).\n   - Additionally, Fae is described as liquid (premise 17).\n\nCombining these facts, we have:\n- Fae is luminous (premise 20).\n- Fae is wooden (premise 21).\n- Fae is liquid (premise 17).\n- Fae is a dumpus (from premises 14, 15, 18, 19, and 9).\n\nTherefore, Fae is luminous, wooden, liquid, and a dumpus.
