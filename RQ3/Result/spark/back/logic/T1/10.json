From premise (4), \"Polly is not a yumpus,\" and premise (1), \"Everything that is a grimpus or a tumpus is a yumpus,\" we can infer that Polly is neither a grimpus nor a tumpus. However, this information is not directly useful for our proof obligation.\n\n2. From premise (3), \"Everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a gorpus,\" and knowing that Polly is not a yumpus from premise (4), we can deduce that if Polly were a wumpus or a brimpus, she would be a gorpus. But since there's no direct information about Polly being a gorpus or not, we need to look at other premises.\n\n3. Premise (2) tells us that \"Everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a yumpus.\" Since Polly is not a yumpus (premise 4), it follows that Polly cannot be either a wumpus or a brimpus. This is because if Polly were either a wumpus or a brimpus, then according to premise (2), she would have to be a yumpus, which contradicts premise (4).\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions that lead to the proof obligation is premises (2) and (4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: $(2),(4)\\rightarrow(6)$."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
