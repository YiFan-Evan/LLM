However, none of these premises directly state that being an impus implies being a numpus.\n\nNow, let's consider the premises related to Sally:\n- Premise (3) states that Sally is a rompus.\n- Premise (7) states that every rompus is a numpus.\n- Premise (11) states that Sally is a rompus.\n- Premise (12) states that Sally is a brimpus and not a numpus.\n\nFrom these premises, we can conclude that Sally is a rompus and thus a numpus (from Premise 7 and Premise 3 or Premise 11). However, Premise 12 contradicts this by stating that Sally is not a numpus. This contradiction suggests that there might be an error in the premises or that the information provided is incomplete.\n\nGiven the current set of premises, we cannot definitively prove that Sally is not an impus because the premises do not provide a direct link between being an impus and not being a numpus. The contradiction in the premises regarding whether Sally is a numpus prevents us from drawing a clear conclusion about Sally's status as an impus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Based on the given premises, we cannot prove that Sally is not an impus due to the conflicting information about whether she is a numpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

However, Premise 12 directly contradicts this by stating that Sally is not a numpus.\n\nThis contradiction indicates an error in the premises or an inconsistency that needs to be resolved. However, for the purpose of proving the given statement, we can use this contradiction to our advantage.\n\nSince Sally cannot be both a numpus and not a numpus simultaneously, and the premises state that she is a rompus (which would make her a numpus), but also state that she is not a numpus, we can infer that there must be an error or additional information not provided that resolves this contradiction.\n\nGiven the current set of premises, we cannot prove that Sally is not an impus directly.
