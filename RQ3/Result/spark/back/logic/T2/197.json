Since Alex is a sterpus (as established above), Alex is also a shumpus.\n\nTherefore, since shumpuses are tumpuses (according to Premise 7), it follows that Alex is a tumpus.\n\nThus, we have used the following chain of reasoning:\n- Alex is a brimpus (Premise 11).\n- Brimpuses are sterpuses (Premise 5).\n- Everything that is a sterpus or an impus or a jompus is a dumpus (Premise 1).\n- Therefore, Alex is a dumpus (from the above two points).\n- Everything that is a sterpus or an impus or a jompus is also a shumpus (Premise 4).\n- Since Alex is a sterpus, Alex is also a shumpus.\n- Shumpuses are tumpuses (Premise 7).\n- Therefore, Alex is a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(1),(2),(4),(5),(7),(11)->(12)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is a brimpus.
