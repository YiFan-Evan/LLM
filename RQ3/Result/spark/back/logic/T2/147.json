From premise (8), we know:\n   - Max is a wumpus.\n\n2. From premise (9), we know:\n   - Max is happy.\n\n3. Using premise (1):\n   - Everything that is happy and a wumpus is a shumpus.\n   - Since Max is both happy and a wumpus, we can instantiate this premise to get:\n     - Max is a shumpus.\n\n4.
