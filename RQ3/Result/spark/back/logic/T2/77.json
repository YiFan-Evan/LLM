This means that if something is a tumpus, it must also be hot, a jompus, and a wumpus.\n- Since Rex is hot, a jompus, and a wumpus (as established earlier), it matches the properties of being a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, since Rex has all the properties of a tumpus, and a gorpus is also a tumpus, we can conclude that Rex is a gorpus.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n(8),(9)->(10)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is aggressive and a vumpus and a numpus.

Since Rex is a tumpus, it follows that Rex could potentially be a gorpus if it meets all the properties of a gorpus.\n\nHowever, to definitively prove that Rex is a gorpus, we must ensure that Rex also possesses the other properties of a gorpus: being bright and a lorpus. The given premises do not provide information about whether Rex is bright or a lorpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the available information, we cannot conclusively prove that Rex is a gorpus.
