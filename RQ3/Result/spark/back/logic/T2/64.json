Everything that is rainy or a zumpus is a vumpus. (This doesn't seem relevant for proving transparency or jompus status.)\n2. Everything that is small or a rompus is a wumpus. (Rex being a rompus might make him a wumpus, but it doesn't help with transparency or jompus.)\n3. Everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus. (This is directly related to our proof obligation. We need to show Rex is either transparent or a jompus to satisfy this.)\n4. Everything that is spicy or a numpus is a jompus. (Rex being a numpus would make him a jompus, which would then make him a tumpus due to premise 3.)\n5. Everything that is discordant or a tumpus is a zumpus. (Once we establish Rex as a tumpus, this will make him a zumpus.)\n6. Everything that is floral or a zumpus is a dumpus. (This doesn't directly help with proving Rex is transparent or a jompus.)\n7. Everything that is slow or a jompus is a lempus. (This doesn't directly help with proving Rex is transparent or a jompus.)\n8. Everything that is aggressive or a numpus is a brimpus.

Rex is a rompus. (While this makes Rex a wumpus according to premise 2, it doesn't help with proving transparency or jompus status.)\n\nNow, let's combine these premises step-by-step to reach the proof obligation:\n\n- From premise 10, Rex is a numpus.\n- According to premise 4, everything that is spicy or a numpus is a jompus. Since Rex is a numpus, he must also be a jompus.\n- Now that we know Rex is a jompus, we can refer back to premise 3, which states that everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus.
