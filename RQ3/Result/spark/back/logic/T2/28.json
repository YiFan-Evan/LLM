Starting with (23) and (24), we know that Polly is both an impus and a brimpus.\n2. From (15), since Polly is a brimpus, she must be a tumpus.\n3. From (9), as a tumpus, Polly is transparent.\n4. From (13), as a yumpus, Polly is not dull.\n5. From (18), as a yumpus, Polly is not dull.\n6. From (17), since every grimpus is a zumpus, and from (5), since numpuses are grimpuses, it follows that numpuses are zumpuses.\n7. From (1), lorpuses are numpuses, so they are also zumpuses.\n8. From (10), lorpuses are shumpuses, so shumpuses are not aggressive (from 21).\n9. From (2), lorpuses are not luminous, which doesn't directly help us prove Polly is not orange but shows a property of lorpuses.\n10. From (22), brimpuses are not fruity, and since Polly is a brimpus, Polly is not fruity.\n11. From (14), every jompus is not sour, and since brimpuses are jompuses (from 6), brimpuses are not sour.\n12. From (4), every grimpus is a vumpus, which doesn't directly relate to Polly being orange but shows another relationship.\n13. From (11), grimpuses are not orange, and since numpuses are grimpuses (from 5), numpuses are not orange.\n14. Since lorpuses are numpuses (from 1), lorpuses are also not orange.\n15.
