Since Alex is a numpus, it follows that Alex is a tumpus.\n4. From premise (7), we know that each sterpus is an impus. Since Alex is a yumpus and from premise (14) impuses are gorpuses, and from premise (23) impuses are zumpuses, and from premise (18) each impus is not snowy, it follows that Alex is not snowy.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that Alex is not snowy.\n\nThe final answer is: (1),(2),(13),(7),(14),(23),(18)->(25)."}]
