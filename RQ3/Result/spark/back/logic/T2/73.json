The key is to identify which premises are relevant to the properties mentioned in the proof obligation and how they can be combined to reach the desired conclusion.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**: We need to find all the premises that mention Wren and any of the properties mentioned in the proof obligation (muffled, loud, discordant, melodic, dumpus).\n\n2. **Combine Premises to Form Intermediate Conclusions**: We will use the relevant premises to form intermediate conclusions that bring us closer to the proof obligation.\n\n3. **Derive the Final Conclusion**: Using the intermediate conclusions, we will derive the final conclusion stated in the proof obligation.\n\nLet's apply these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Premises\nFrom the list of premises, the following are directly relevant to Wren and the properties mentioned in the proof obligation:\n- (6) Wren is angry.\n- (7) Wren is melodic.\n- (9) Wren is mean.\n- (10) Wren is discordant.\n- (11) Wren is muffled.\n- (12) Wren is amenable.\n- (13) Wren is aggressive.\n- (14) Wren is dull.\n- (16) Wren is an impus.\n- (17) Wren is loud.\n\n### Step 2: Combine Premises to Form Intermediate Conclusions\nWe need to combine these premises to form intermediate conclusions that help us reach the final conclusion.\n\n#### Intermediate Conclusion 1:\nCombining (6), (9), (12), (13), and (16):\n- Since Wren is amenable, mean, angry, aggressive, and an impus, according to premise (2), Wren is a dumpus.\n\n#### Intermediate Conclusion 2:\nCombining (7), (10), (11), (17), and (1):\n- Since Wren is bright and an impus, according to premise (1), Wren is a sterpus.\n- Since Wren is a sterpus and also has the properties muffled, loud, discordant, and melodic, these properties do not change the fact that Wren is a dumpus (as per Intermediate Conclusion 1).\n\n### Step 3: Derive the Final Conclusion\nUsing Intermediate Conclusions 1 and 2, we can state:\n- Wren is muffled, loud, discordant, melodic, and a dumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```\n(6),(7),(9),(10),(11),(12),(13),(14),(16),(17)->(18)\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Wren is loud.
