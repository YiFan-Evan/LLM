From premise (9), we know that everything that is muffled and a yumpus is a numpus. Since Wren is a numpus, it doesn't necessarily mean it is muffled or a yumpus, but it sets the stage for further investigation.\n3.

Since Wren is both wooden (from premise 16) and a numpus (from premise 14), we can conclude that Wren is a tumpus.\n7.
