We'll look for premises that directly relate to the properties of being \"temperate\" and \"a vumpus\".\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Properties:** The proof obligation states that Stella is both temperate and a vumpus. Therefore, we need to find premises that connect these two properties.\n\n2. **Analyze Premises:**\n   - Premise (2): Everything that is temperate and a vumpus is a wumpus.\n   - This premise directly mentions \"temperate\" and \"a vumpus\", but it also introduces a third property, \"a wumpus\", which is not part of our proof obligation.\n\n3. **Determine Minimal Set of Premises:** Since the goal is to prove that Stella is temperate and a vumpus, and no other premise directly links these two properties without introducing additional unrelated properties, we only need to rely on the definition or direct statement about Stella being temperate and a vumpus.\n\n4. **Conclusion:** However, in the given list of premises, there isn't a direct statement that Stella is temperate and a vumpus. The closest we get is premise (2) which talks about something temperate and a vumpus being a wumpus, but this does not help us prove that Stella is specifically temperate and a vumpus without introducing the property of being a wumpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, it seems impossible to directly prove that Stella is temperate and a vumpus without additional information or premises that directly state this fact.\n\nThe final answer is: There is no minimal set of premises that can be used to derive (20) from the given list, as the necessary direct connection between Stella being temperate and a vumpus is missing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Stella is angry.
