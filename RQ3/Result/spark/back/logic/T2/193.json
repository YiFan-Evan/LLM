Start by identifying the relevant premises related to Rex and properties of shumpuses.\n   - Rex is a sterpus (premise 23).\n   - Rex is a dumpus (premise 24).\n   - Every jompus is a gorpus (premise 4).\n   - Jompuses are shumpuses (premise 12).\n   - Each shumpus is not feisty (premise 1).\n\n2. From premises 12 and 4, we can infer that every jompus is also a gorpus.\n   - Therefore, every shumpus (since jompuses are shumpuses) is also a gorpus.\n\n3. Since Rex is a dumpus (premise 24), and every dumpus is an impus (premise 10), Rex is also an impus.\n   - This connection helps us link Rex to other entities but doesn't directly help with the current proof obligation.\n\n4. Now, using the chain of relationships:\n   - Rex is a sterpus (premise 23).\n   - Each sterpus is a grimpus (premise 5).\n   - Each grimpus is aggressive (premise 11).\n   - Grimpuses are jompuses (premise 14).\n   - Jompuses are shumpuses (premise 12).\n   - Each shumpus is not feisty (premise 1).\n\n5. Combining these, we get:\n   - Rex is a sterpus -> Rex is a grimpus -> Rex is a jompus -> Rex is a shumpus.\n   - Since each shumpus is not feisty (premise 1), and Rex is a shumpus, it follows that Rex is not feisty.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ (1),(5),(11),(12),(14),(23) \\rightarrow (25) \\]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a dumpus.

From premise 24, we know that every shumpus is not feisty. To prove that Rex is not feisty, we need to show that Rex is a shumpus.\n\n3. Using premise 20, we can infer:\n   - Every jompus is a gorpus.\n\n4. Using premise 13, we know:\n   - Jompuses are shumpuses.\n\n5. Combining premises 20 and 13, we get:\n   - Every jompus is a shumpus.\n\n6. Using premise 11, we know:\n   - Grimpuses are jompuses.\n\n7. Combining premises 11 and 20, we get:\n   - Every grimpus is a shumpus.\n\n8. Using premise 20 again, we know:\n   - Every sterpus is a grimpus.\n\n9.

Since Rex is a shumpus, and each shumpus is not feisty (premise 24), we can conclude:\n    - Rex is not feisty.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[ (1),(2),(11),(13),(20),(24) \\rightarrow (25) \\]"}]
