This principle allows us to link properties through intermediate entities.\n2. **Conjunction Combination:** If an entity has multiple properties (e.g., A is both B and C), we can use these properties individually to form connections with other entities that share any of these properties.\n3. **Chaining Premises:** By combining multiple premises, we can create a chain of reasoning that links entities together through shared properties.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the given premises to prove that Sally is a lorpus.\n\n**Proof:**\n\n1. From premise (8), Sally is a rompus.\n2. From premise (1), since Sally is a rompus, she is also a sterpus and a yumpus.

Since Sally is a wumpus (from the previous step), if we can show that Sally is also a dumpus, we can conclude that Sally is a lorpus.\n6. To show that Sally is a dumpus, we need to find a connection between being a dumpus and one of Sally's established properties. However, none of the premises directly connect Sally's properties to being a dumpus.\n7. But from premise (3), every lorpus is also a wumpus. Since Sally is a wumpus (from step 4), and every lorpus is also a wumpus, it follows that Sally must be a lorpus to satisfy the condition of being a wumpus and potentially other properties of a lorpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(8),(9)->(10)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sally is aggressive and mean and a shumpus and a lempus.
