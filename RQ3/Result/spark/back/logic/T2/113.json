Since Max is a dumpus (from **Premise (1)**), Max cannot be a numpus if Max were a tumpus (from **Premise (6)**).\n\nTherefore, Max cannot be a tumpus because it would contradict the fact that dumpuses are not numpuses.\n\n### Minimal Set of Premises:\n- **(1), (5), (6), (8), (11) -> (13)**\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{(1),(5),(6),(8),(11)->(13)}\n\\]"}]
