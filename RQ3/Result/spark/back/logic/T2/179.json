Using (5), we can deduce that \"Everything that is a shumpus and a lorpus and a wumpus is a yumpus,\" so since Max is a shumpus and a wumpus (from steps 3 and 2), if Max is also a lorpus, then Max is a yumpus.\n5.

From (15), we know that \"Max is an impus.\"\n12. Using (14) and knowing that \"Rompuses are jompuses,\" we can deduce that \"Max is a jompus\" (not directly stated but implied through other relationships).\n13.
