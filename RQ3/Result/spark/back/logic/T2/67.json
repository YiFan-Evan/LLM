Let's break down the process:\n\n1. Start with the properties of Polly that are directly stated:\n   - Polly is a brimpus (premise 8).\n   - Polly is a zumpus (premise 9).\n   - Polly is feisty (premise 10).\n   - Polly is nervous (premise 11).\n   - Polly is snowy (premise 12).\n   - Polly is sunny (premise 13).\n   - Polly is brown (premise 14).\n   - Polly is windy (premise 15).\n   - Polly is blue (premise 16).\n   - Polly is red (premise 17).\n   - Polly is rainy (premise 18).\n   - Polly is shy (premise 19).\n   - Polly is orange (premise 20).\n   - Polly is happy (premise 21).\n\n2. Use these properties to connect Polly to other categories through intermediate conclusions:\n   - Since Polly is a zumpus (premise 9) and Polly is snowy, sunny, windy, and rainy (premises 12, 13, 15, 18), by premise 5, we can conclude that Polly is a grimpus.\n\n3.
