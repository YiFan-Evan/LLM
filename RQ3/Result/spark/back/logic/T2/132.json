We'll start by examining each premise and seeing how they relate to the properties described in the proof obligation.\n\n1. From premise (2), we know that \"Everything that is kind and angry and aggressive and amenable and a lempus is a vumpus.\" This directly matches part of our proof obligation, but it also introduces the term \"vumpus,\" which we don't need for our proof. However, it does show us that the combination of these traits (kind, angry, aggressive, amenable) is associated with something else (a lempus).\n\n2. Premise (3) states, \"Everything that is bitter and sweet and spicy and sour and a gorpus is a lempus.\" This matches part of our proof obligation as it includes the term \"lempus.\"\n\n3. Premise (4) says, \"Everything that is bright and dull and a lempus is a tumpus.\" This doesn't seem to add anything to our proof obligation directly, as it talks about being a \"tumpus\" which isn't relevant here.\n\n4. Premise (5) states, \"Everything that is shy and nervous and happy and feisty and an impus is a yumpus.\" This doesn't contribute to our proof obligation either.\n\n5. Premises (6-9) describe Alex as having the properties of being wooden, liquid, metallic, luminous, and a gorpus. These are all properties that match part of the first premise (1), which states, \"Everything that is liquid, wooden, metallic, luminous, and a gorpus is a sterpus.\"\n\n6. Premises (10-19) describe Alex as having the properties of being bitter, sweet, spicy, sour, shy, nervous, happy, feisty, kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and an impus. These properties match the descriptions in premises (2), (3), and (5).\n\nNow, let's combine the relevant premises to form a chain that leads to the proof obligation:\n\n- From premises (6-9), we can conclude that Alex is a sterpus because he has all the properties listed in premise (1).\n- From premises (10-19), we can see that Alex has the properties of being bitter, sweet, spicy, sour, and a gorpus, which matches the criteria in premise (3) for being a lempus.\n- Since Alex is a lempus and has the properties of being kind, angry, aggressive, and amenable (as stated in premises (11-18)), he fits the description in premise (2) for being a vumpus.\n\nHowever, we don't need to prove that Alex is a vumpus or a sterpus; we only need to prove that he is kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus. Therefore, the minimal set of premises that directly leads to the proof obligation is:\n\n- Premise (3): Everything that is bitter and sweet and spicy and sour and a gorpus is a lempus.\n- Premises (10-19): Describing Alex's properties.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(3),(10-19)->(20)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is sour.
