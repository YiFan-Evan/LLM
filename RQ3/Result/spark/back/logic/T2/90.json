From (1), we know:\n- Each tumpus is an impus.\n\nSince Alex is a tumpus (from (9)), and every tumpus is an impus (from (1)), we can deduce that:\n- Alex is an impus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(8),(9),(1)->(10)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is wooden and metallic and a wumpus and a tumpus.
