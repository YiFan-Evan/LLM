In this case, we are looking for premises that involve Alex being cold, hot, temperate, and a rompus.\n\n2. **Chaining Premises**: We then look for chains of premises that can link these attributes together. For example, if we know that something is both cold and hot, and another premise states that being both cold and hot makes something temperate, then we can use these to show that something is temperate.\n\n3. **Use Intermediate Conclusions**: As we chain the premises, we may form intermediate conclusions that help us reach the final goal. These intermediate steps are crucial as they bridge gaps between different attributes.\n\n4. **Form a Logical Path**: The goal is to form a logical path from the given premises to the proof obligation.
