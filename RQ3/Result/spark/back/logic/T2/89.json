We need to show that \"Max is a tumpus\" (11) can be inferred from the provided premises.\n\nLet's break down the process step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Identify Relevant Premises\nWe start by identifying which premises are most directly related to Max and the properties of a tumpus.\n\n1. **Premise (3):** Each impus is large, a wumpus, and a gorpus.\n2. **Premise (4):** Dumpuses are spicy and impuses.\n3. **Premise (5):** Each tumpus is hot and a sterpus and a brimpus.\n4. **Premise (6):** Sterpuses are luminous, yumpuses, and lorpuses.\n5. **Premise (9):** Max is luminous and a lorpus and a yumpus.\n6. **Premise (10):** Max is large, a grimpus, and a gorpus.\n\n### Step 2: Deduce Intermediate Conclusions\nWe will now try to deduce intermediate conclusions based on these premises.\n\n- From Premise (6) and Premise (9), we know that Max is a sterpus because he is luminous, a lorpus, and a yumpus.\n- From Premise (10), Max is a gorpus.\n- From Premise (3) and Premise (10), since Max is a gorpus, he must be an impus.\n- From Premise (4), as an impus, Max must also be a dumpus (spicy).\n\n### Step 3: Connect with Tumpus Properties\nNow, we need to connect the properties of Max with those of a tumpus.\n\n- From Premise (5), a tumpus is hot and a sterpus and a brimpus.\n- Since Max is already established as a sterpus, we need to check if he is also hot and a brimpus.\n\n### Step 4: Check for Additional Information\nUnfortunately, there is no direct information given about Max being hot or a brimpus. Therefore, we cannot conclude that Max is a tumpus solely based on the given premises.\n\n### Conclusion\nBased on the given premises, we cannot prove that \"Max is a tumpus\" (11).
