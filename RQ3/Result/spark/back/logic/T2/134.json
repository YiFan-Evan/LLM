Let's see if we can do that:\n\n- Rex is already identified as a dumpus from **Premise (9)**.\n- Dumpuses are related to grimpuses through **Premise (3)**, but we need to establish that connection more clearly.\n\nUnfortunately, there is no direct link provided between Rex and grimpus or zumpus using the given premises.
