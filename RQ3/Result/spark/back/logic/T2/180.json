The fundamental principles involved in solving such problems include logical deduction, understanding of conditional statements, and the use of transitivity.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**: We start by identifying which premises are directly related to the concept of \"impus\" as it appears in the proof obligation. In this case, premise (1) states that everything that is an impus is a tumpus, and premise (5) states that everything that is an impus is also a shumpus.\n\n2. **Analyze Contradictions**: We then look for any contradictions within the premises that might help us prove the negation of being an impus. Premise (12) states that Sally is not a numpus, while premise (9) states that everything that is a dumpus, shumpus, or wumpus is a numpus. This implies that Sally cannot be a shumpus because if she were, she would also have to be a numpus, which contradicts premise (12).\n\n3. **Combine Information**: Since Sally cannot be a shumpus (due to the contradiction with her not being a numpus), and every impus is a shumpus (premise 5), it follows that Sally cannot be an impus.\n\n4. **Formulate the Deduction**: Based on the above analysis, we can deduce that Sally is not an impus because being an impus would imply being a shumpus, which in turn would imply being a numpus, contradicting the statement that Sally is not a numpus.\n\nTherefore, using premises (5), (9), and (12), we can derive the proof obligation (13) that Sally is not an impus.\n\nThe final answer is: `(5),(9),(12)->(13)`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sally is a yumpus and Sally is a brimpus and Sally is not a numpus.
