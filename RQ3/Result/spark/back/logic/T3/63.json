Premise (1) tells us that if something is moderate, fast, and a wumpus, then it is a lorpus. This directly relates to our proof obligation, but we need to establish that Polly is a wumpus first.\n   \n2. Premise (5) states that everything that is muffled, melodic, and a tumpus is a wumpus. Since Polly is already established as a tumpus in premise (10), we can use premises (11) and (13) to show that Polly is muffled and melodic, which would make Polly a wumpus according to premise (5).\n\n3. Premises (10), (11), (12), (13), and (14) establish that Polly is a tumpus, muffled, fast, melodic, and moderate, respectively. These are all properties that we need to prove the proof obligation.\n\nCombining these observations, we can derive the following sequence of inferences:\n\n- From premise (10), we know that Polly is a tumpus.\n- From premise (11), we know that Polly is muffled.\n- From premise (13), we know that Polly is melodic.\n- Since Polly is muffled, melodic, and a tumpus, premise (5) allows us to conclude that Polly is a wumpus.\n- From premise (14), we know that Polly is moderate.\n- From premise (12), we know that Polly is fast.\n- Since Polly is now established as being moderate, fast, and a wumpus, premise (1) allows us to conclude that Polly is a lorpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises that can be used to prove the proof obligation is:\n\n(5), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14) -> (18)\n\nThis set of premises establishes all the necessary properties of Polly to satisfy the proof obligation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is moderate, fast, and a wumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
