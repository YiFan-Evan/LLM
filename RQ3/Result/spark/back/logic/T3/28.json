Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to approach it:\n\n1. **Understand the Relationships**: First, identify the relationships between the terms in the premises. For example, \"Lorpuses are numpuses\" establishes a relationship between lorpuses and numpuses.\n\n2. **Chain of Reasoning**: Look for chains of reasoning that can link the initial premises to the final conclusion. This often involves finding intermediary steps where one premise connects to another through shared terms.\n\n3. **Identify Relevant Premises**: Focus on the premises that directly relate to the terms involved in the proof obligation or those that can be logically linked to form a chain leading to the proof obligation.\n\n4. **Formulate the Path**: Starting from the proof obligation, work backward to see which premises can be combined to reach it. Alternatively, start from known premises and see if they lead to the proof obligation.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the given problem:\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Start with Polly**: Since Polly is both an impus (20) and a brimpus (24), we need to find properties of impuses and brimpuses that can help us prove that Polly is not orange.\n\n2. **Properties of Brimpuses**: From (15), tumpuses are brimpuses.

However, being not feisty doesn't help us determine if Polly is orange.\n\n4. **Combining Information**: Since Polly is a brimpus (24) and brimpuses are transparent (from step 2), we know Polly is transparent. Transparency does not imply color, but it helps narrow down possibilities.\n\n5. **Orange and Grimpuses**: From (11), grimpuses are not orange.
