Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**: We need to identify which premises are directly related to the conclusion that Taylor is a visionary. The most relevant premise seems to be (1): \"if Alex is not snowy then Taylor is a visionary.\"\n\n2. **Find a Connection Between Alex and Snowiness**: Since the conclusion depends on Alex being not snowy, we need to find a premise that states or implies that Alex is not snowy. Premise (8) states: \"Each impus is not snowy.\"\n\n3. **Connect Alex to Impus**: To use premise (8), we need to establish that Alex is an impus. However, none of the premises directly state that Alex is an impus. Instead, premise (24) states: \"Alex is a numpus,\" and premise (19) states: \"Each sterpus is an impus.\"\n\n4. **Connect Numpus to Sterpus**: We already know from premise (24) that Alex is a numpus. To connect Alex to a sterpus, we need to find a connection between numpus and sterpus. Premise (23) states: \"Every tumpus is a sterpus.\"\n\n5. **Connect Numpus to Tumpus**: Premise (13) states: \"Every numpus is a tumpus.\"\n\n6. **Combine Connections**: By combining the connections from numpus to tumpus (premise 13) and tumpus to sterpus (premise 23), we can conclude that every numpus is a sterpus.\n\n7. **Final Step**: Since Alex is a numpus (premise 24), and every numpus is a sterpus (combined from premises 13 and 23), then Alex is a sterpus. As a sterpus, Alex is also an impus (premise 19).\n\n8. **Conclude Taylor is Visionary**: Since Alex is an impus, and each impus is not snowy (premise 8), then Alex is not snowy. According to premise (1), if Alex is not snowy, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(1), (8), (13), (19), (23), (24) -> (26)"}]
