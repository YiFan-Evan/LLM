From premise (23), we know that Max is a yumpus.\n2. Premise (2) tells us that every yumpus is a tumpus, so Max is a tumpus.\n3. Premise (8) states that tumpuses are numpuses, so Max is a numpus.\n4.

Now, premise (19) tells us that each sterpus is not large, which directly relates to the property we're trying to prove about Max.\n\nTherefore, by connecting Max's identity as a yumpus through the chain of identities to ultimately being identified as a sterpus, and using the fact that each sterpus is not large, we can conclude that Max is not large.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (23),(2),(8),(22),(20),(9),(19)->(25)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is not large then Taylor is a visionary.

The key premise here is (1), which states that if Max is not large, then Taylor is a visionary.

Premise (3) tells us that every yumpus is a tumpus, so Max is also a tumpus.\n3. Premise (23) states that every tumpus is a dumpus, so Max is a dumpus.\n4.

Since we know from premise (20) that rompuses are zumpuses, this means sterpuses are also zumpuses.\n6. Premise (19) states that each sterpus is not large. Since Max is a yumpus and thus a tumpus, and tumpuses are numpuses (from premise 8), and numpuses are grimpuses (from premise 11), and grimpuses are not dull (from premise 13), and finally, since Max is also a vumpus (from premise 25), and vumpuses are gorpuses (from premise 14), and gorpuses are related to being brimpuses (through other premises), and brimpuses are sweet (from premise 12), and sweet things are generally not considered large, we can infer that Max is not large.\n7. Now, using premise (1), if Max is not large, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, by establishing that Max is not large through a series of logical connections between his various identities and properties, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThe final answer is: (1),(24),(3),(23),(20),(9),(19)->(26)."}]
