We'll do this by examining each premise and identifying how they can be combined to derive the desired conclusion.\n\n1. **Start with the known facts about Max:**\n   - Max is a wumpus (Premise 10).\n   - Max is a gorpus (Premise 11).\n\n2. **Find connections between the known facts and other premises:**\n   - Premise 8 states that everything that is windy, rainy, or a gorpus is a dumpus. Since Max is a gorpus, it follows that:\n     - Max is a dumpus.\n\n3. **Use the derived information to find more connections:**\n   - Premise 9 states that everything that is transparent, opaque, or a wumpus is a grimpus. Since Max is a wumpus, it follows that:\n     - Max is a grimpus.\n\n4. **Continue searching for connections:**\n   - Premise 7 states that everything that is moderate, slow, or a tumpus is an impus. However, there is no direct connection from Max being a dumpus, gorpus, or grimpus to being moderate, slow, or a tumpus. Therefore, this premise does not help in deriving the proof obligation.\n\n5. **Look for alternative paths:**\n   - Premise 6 states that everything that is discordant, melodic, or an impus is a yumpus. There is no direct connection from Max being a dumpus, gorpus, or grimpus to being discordant, melodic, or an impus. Therefore, this premise also does not help.\n\n6. **Explore further connections:**\n   - Premise 5 states that everything that is cold, hot, or a lempus is a sterpus. There is no direct connection from Max being a dumpus, gorpus, or grimpus to being cold, hot, or a lempus. Therefore, this premise does not help.\n\n7. **Check remaining premises:**\n   - Premise 4 states that everything that is small, large, or an impus is a vumpus. There is no direct connection from Max being a dumpus, gorpus, or grimpus to being small, large, or an impus. Therefore, this premise does not help.\n\n8. **Consider the remaining premises:**\n   - Premise 3 states that everything that is aggressive, angry, or a gorpus is a lempus. Since Max is a gorpus, it follows that:\n     - Max is a lempus.\n\n9. **Finally, use the derived fact about Max being a lempus to connect to the proof obligation:**\n   - Premise 2 states that everything that is blue, orange, or a lempus is a tumpus. Since Max is a lempus, it follows that:\n     - Max is a tumpus.\n\n10. **Combine the final derived fact with the proof obligation:**\n    - The proof obligation states that Max is blue, orange, or a lempus. Since we have established that Max is a lempus, this satisfies the proof obligation.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions required to derive the proof obligation is: {(2), (3), (10), (11)}.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2), (3), (10), (11) -> (12)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is blue, orange, or a lempus then Taylor is a visionary.
