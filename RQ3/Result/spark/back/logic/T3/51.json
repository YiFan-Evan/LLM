According to premise (2), since Fae is an impus, Fae must also be a grimpus. This information is already stated in premise (7), but it's good to verify consistency.\n\nNext, from premise (8), we also know that Fae is a vumpus and a numpus. From premise (4), we know that every numpus is a jompus, so Fae is also a jompus. This information is not directly needed for our proof but helps establish Fae's characteristics.\n\nNow, from premise (7), we know Fae is a vumpus, a grimpus, and a wumpus. According to premise (6), anything that is a vumpus, a grimpus, or a wumpus is a shumpus, confirming that Fae is a shumpus.\n\nThe crucial step comes from premise (3), which states that everything that is a vumpus, a dumpus, or a gorpus is a zumpus. Since Fae is a vumpus (from premise 8), Fae must be a zumpus.\n\nHaving established that Fae is a zumpus, we can now refer back to premise (1), which states that if Fae is a zumpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThus, the minimal set of premises needed to derive that Taylor is a visionary includes premises (1), (3), and (8).
