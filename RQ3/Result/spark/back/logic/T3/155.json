Therefore, using (1), if Rex is not a lempus then Taylor is a visionary, but since Rex is actually a lempus, this condition is not met.\n\nThus, the only way to satisfy all the premises without contradiction is to accept that Rex is a lempus, which means Taylor cannot be a visionary based on the given information.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nThere is no minimal set of premises provided that directly leads to the conclusion that \"Taylor is a visionary.\" The statement (22) appears to be an independent contradiction rather than a logical consequence of the given premises."}]
