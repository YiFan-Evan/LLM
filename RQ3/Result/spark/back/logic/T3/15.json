We should start by identifying which premises directly or indirectly relate to Wren and then find a chain of reasoning that leads to the conclusion that Wren is a rompus. Let's break down the relevant information step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Relevant Premises**: \n   - From (14) and (15), we know that Wren is one of the following: shumpus, jompus, zumpus, brimpus, or tumpus.\n\n2. **Find Connections to Rompus**:\n   - From (1), (6), (7), (10), and (13), we see that each of these creatures (zumpus, yumpus, brimpus, jompus, wumpus) is a rompus.\n   - From (8), we know that brimpuses are grimpuses.\n   - From (9), we know that every tumpus is a grimpus.\n   - From (11), we know that every zumpus is a grimpus.\n   - From (12), we know that every jompus is a grimpus.\n\n3. **Combine Information**:\n   - Since Wren can be any of the specified creatures and all of those creatures are either directly stated as rompuses or are grimpuses (which we need to further investigate), we need to determine if being a grimpus necessarily means being a rompus.\n   - However, there is no direct premise stating that grimpuses are rompuses. Therefore, we cannot directly conclude that Wren is a rompus based solely on being a grimpus.\n   - But, looking at the premises again, we notice that all the creatures listed in (14) and (15) as potential identities for Wren are also stated to be rompuses in other premises. This means regardless of whether Wren is a shumpus, jompus, zumpus, brimpus, or tumpus, Wren is a rompus because each of these creatures is directly stated to be a rompus.\n\n4. **Formulate the Proof**:\n   - If Wren is a shumpus, from (1) we have that Wren is a rompus.\n   - If Wren is a jompus, from (10) we have that Wren is a rompus.\n   - If Wren is a zumpus, from (1) we have that Wren is a rompus.\n   - If Wren is a brimpus, from (7) we have that Wren is a rompus.\n   - If Wren is a tumpus, from (4) we have that Wren is a rompus.\n   - Since Wren must be one of these creatures according to (14) and (15), in every possible case, Wren is a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(12),(13),(14),(15)->(16)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is a rompus then Taylor is a visionary.
