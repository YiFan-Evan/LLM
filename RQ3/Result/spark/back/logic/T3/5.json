From premise (4): Every zumpus is a yumpus and a grimpus.\n   - Since Fae is a zumpus (from premise (6) Dumpuses are zumpuses and Fae is a dumpus), it follows that Fae is a yumpus and a grimpus.\n\n2. From premise (9): Fae is a zumpus and a yumpus.\n   - This confirms Fae is indeed a yumpus.\n\n3. From premise (5): Every yumpus is a gorpus and an impus.\n   - Since Fae is a yumpus, it follows that Fae is a gorpus and an impus.\n\n4. From premise (3): Each grimpus is a sterpus and a rompus.\n   - Since Fae is a grimpus (inferred from being a zumpus), it follows that Fae is a sterpus and a rompus.\n\n5. From premise (1): Each sterpus is a brimpus and a jompus.\n   - Since Fae is a sterpus, it follows that Fae is a brimpus and a jompus.\n\n6. From premise (2): Each rompus is a lempus and a numpus.\n   - Since Fae is a rompus, it follows that Fae is a lempus and a numpus.\n\n7. From premise (7): Numpuses are tumpuses and vumpuses.\n   - Since Fae is a numpus, it follows that Fae is a tumpus and a vumpus.\n\n8. From premise (10): Fae is a vumpus and a tumpus.\n   - This confirms Fae is indeed a vumpus and a tumpus.\n\nSince we have already established that Fae is a grimpus from being a zumpus, we don't need further derivation for this specific proof obligation.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that \"Fae is a grimpus\" includes those that establish Fae as a zumpus, which in turn implies Fae is a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `(4),(6),(9)->(11)`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Fae is a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.
