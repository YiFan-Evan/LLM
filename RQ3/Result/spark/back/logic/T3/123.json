However, to ensure that our derivation is minimal and correctly ordered, let's consider if there are other premises that could be involved in the derivation. Premise (6) tells us that jompuses are gorpuses and tumpuses, but this does not directly relate to Polly being a sterpus. Premise (7) tells us that each wumpus is a zumpus and a rompus, which is relevant because Polly is a wumpus (from being a gorpus), but again, this does not affect the conclusion that Polly is a sterpus.\n\n3. The other premises (1-4, 9) do not provide any direct information that would alter the conclusion derived from premise (5) and the fact that Polly is a gorpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Polly is a sterpus consists only of premise (5) and the information that Polly is a gorpus (premise 8).
