The key is to find a chain of reasoning that starts from known facts about Stella and leads directly to the desired conclusion.\n\nLet's break down the process step-by-step:\n\n1. Identify the given properties of Stella: \n   - Stella is red (12)\n   - Stella is a rompus (13)\n   - Stella is sweet (14)\n   - Stella is a tumpus (15)\n   - Stella is large (16)\n   - Stella is blue (17)\n   - Stella is small (18)\n   - Stella is sour (19)\n\n2. We need to prove that Stella is blue and red and a jompus.\n\n3. From the given properties, we can see that Stella is both blue (17) and red (12), so we already have part of the proof obligation covered.\n\n4. Next, we need to show that Stella is a jompus. To do this, we can use the following chain of reasoning:\n   - Stella is sweet (14) and sour (19), which means by premise (6), Stella is a jompus.\n\nNow, combining these steps, we get:\n- Stella is blue (17).\n- Stella is red (12).\n- Stella is a jompus (from being sweet and sour as per premise 6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n(12), (14), (17), (19), (6) -> (20)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Stella is blue and red and a jompus then Taylor is a visionary.
