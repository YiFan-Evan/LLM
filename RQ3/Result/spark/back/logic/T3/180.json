However, premise (13) explicitly states that Sally is not a numpus, which contradicts our previous deduction. This means there must be an error in our interpretation of the premises or a logical mistake.\n\nGiven this contradiction, let's focus on proving that Sally is not an impus, which will allow us to conclude that Taylor is a visionary based on premise (1).\n\nFrom premise (12), we know that Sally is a rompus. According to premise (2), everything that is a rompus is a tumpus, which confirms that Sally is a tumpus. However, being a tumpus does not directly tell us anything about whether Sally is an impus.\n\nWe need to find a way to connect Sally's status as a rompus with her not being an impus. Let's explore further:\n\n- From premise (6), we know that everything that is an impus is a shumpus.\n- From premise (7), we know that everything that is a lorpus or a shumpus or a grimpus is a vumpus.\n- From premise (5), we know that each brimpus is a lorpus.\n\nSince Sally is a brimpus (from premise (13)), she is also a lorpus (from premise (5)). As a lorpus, Sally is also a vumpus (from premise (7)).\n\nNow, let's consider the relationship between being a rompus and being an impus:\n\n- From premise (2), we know that everything that is a rompus is a tumpus.\n- From premise (6), we know that everything that is an impus is a shumpus.\n- From premise (7), we know that everything that is a lorpus or a shumpus or a grimpus is a vumpus.\n\nSince Sally is a rompus and therefore a tumpus, and being an impus would make her a shumpus and consequently a vumpus, nothing in these premises directly contradicts the possibility that Sally could be an impus.\n\nHowever, from premise (13), we know that Sally is not a numpus. If Sally were an impus, she would be a shumpus (from premise (6)) and therefore a numpus (from premise (10)), which contradicts premise (13).\n\nTherefore, by elimination and contradiction, we can conclude that Sally cannot be an impus because it would lead to her being a numpus, which is explicitly denied in premise (13).\n\nThus, since Sally is not an impus, according to premise (1), Taylor is a visionary.\n\nThe final answer is: (1),(13)->(14)."}]
