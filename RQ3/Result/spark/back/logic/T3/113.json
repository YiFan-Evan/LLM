From **Premise (12)**, Max is an impus, a dumpus, and a jompus.\n2. From **Premise (1)**, since Max is a jompus, Max is also a rompus.\n3. From **Premise (9)**, since Max is a dumpus, Max is also a rompus.\n4. From **Premise (4)**, since Max is an impus, Max is also a shumpus.\n5. From **Premise (8)**, Max is a brimpus.\n6.

From **Premise (10)**, each tumpus is a rompus.\n\nNow, let's check if Max can be a tumpus:\n- If Max were a tumpus, then by **Premise (7)**, Max would be a numpus, a sterpus, and a wumpus.\n- By **Premise (5)**, Max is already a numpus, so this part is consistent.\n- By **Premise (6)**, since Max is a wumpus, Max is also a rompus, which is consistent with **Premise (10)**.\n- The contradiction arises when considering **Premise (2)** and **Premise (12)**:\n  - From **Premise (2)**, dumpuses are not numpuses.\n  - From **Premise (12)**, Max is a dumpus.\n  - From **Premise (5)** and **Premise (8)**, Max is a brimpus and therefore a numpus.\n\nSince Max cannot be both a dumpus (which implies not a numpus) and a numpus (as derived from being a brimpus), Max cannot be a tumpus.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe minimal set of premises that lead to the conclusion that Max is not a tumpus includes the premises that establish the contradiction between Max being a dumpus and a numpus.
