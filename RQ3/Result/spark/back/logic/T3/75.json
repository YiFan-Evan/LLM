However, this doesn't directly help us prove that Wren is sunny and a tumpus; it only tells us about the nature of things that are both sunny and a tumpus.\n\nNext, we look for premises that might help us establish that Wren is a tumpus. Premise (4) states that everything that is wooden and a numpus is a tumpus. We already know from premise (16) that Wren is wooden, so if we can establish that Wren is also a numpus, then we can conclude that Wren is a tumpus.\n\nNow, let's examine the premises to see if we can establish that Wren is a numpus. Premise (9) states that everything that is muffled and a yumpus is a numpus. However, we don't have any information about whether Wren is muffled or a yumpus. So, this path does not lead to a conclusion.\n\nLet's try another approach. Premise (5) states that everything that is transparent and a numpus is a wumpus. We know from premise (12) that Wren is transparent, but we still need to establish that Wren is a numpus.\n\nSince we couldn't establish that Wren is a numpus using the given premises, let's re-examine the premises to see if there's another way to connect Wren being sunny and a tumpus.\n\nPremise (6) states that everything that is large and an impus is a rompus. This doesn't help us directly with the current proof obligation.\n\nPremise (7) states that everything that is brown and an impus is a shumpus. This also doesn't help us directly.\n\nPremise (8) states that everything that is feisty and a zumpus is a lorpus. This doesn't help us either.\n\nPremise (10) states that everything that is fruity and a rompus is a lempus. This doesn't seem relevant to our current goal.\n\nPremise (11) states that everything that is bitter and a yumpus is a vumpus. This doesn't help us either.\n\nPremise (13) states that Wren is a zumpus. This might be useful if we can find a connection between being a zumpus and being sunny or a tumpus, but none of the other premises seem to make such a connection.\n\nPremise (14) states that Wren is a numpus. As discussed earlier, this could potentially help us establish that Wren is a tumpus if we can connect it to the fact that Wren is wooden (premise 16). However, we still need to establish that Wren is sunny.\n\nPremise (15) states that Wren is sunny. This is exactly what we need to prove one part of our proof obligation!\n\nNow, combining premise (15) that Wren is sunny, and premise (16) that Wren is wooden, with premise (4) that everything that is wooden and a numpus is a tumpus, we can conclude that Wren is a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (15),(16),(4)->(17)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is sunny and a tumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
