Since rompuses are not explicitly listed in any of the premises as being a lempus, an impus, or a yumpus, we need to find another path.\n\n6. **Revisit Premise (2) and (8):**\n   - Polly is a wumpus, which means she is also a brimpus (Premise 2).\n   - As a brimpus, Polly is also a dumpus (Premise 7).\n\n7. **Finalize the Proof:**\n   - By combining all these properties, we see that Polly is a rompus, a wumpus, a brimpus, and thus a dumpus. Since being a dumpus includes being a lempus, an impus, or a yumpus (Premise 4), Polly fits into one of these categories.\n\n### Final Answer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\\[(2),(5),(7),(8),(9),(10) \\rightarrow (11)\\]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is a lempus or an impus or a yumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
