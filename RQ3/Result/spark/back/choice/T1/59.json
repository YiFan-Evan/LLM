It could be a suitable option for learning about computers.\nB. facebook - Facebook is a social media platform and not a place for learning about computers in a formal sense.\nC. school - School can refer to an educational institution where various subjects are taught, including potentially computer skills.\nD. apartment - An apartment is a living space and not related to learning about computers.\nE. demonstration - A demonstration could involve showing someone how to use a computer, which might be a quick way to learn.\n\nConsidering the context, the most logical option would be something that provides structured learning or guidance on using a computer. While both \"classroom\" and \"school\" could fit this description, \"demonstration\" (E) is more directly related to the immediate need to understand a computer after finding it difficult at the store.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. demonstration."}]
