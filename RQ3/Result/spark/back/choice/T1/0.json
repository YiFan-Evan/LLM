Farmland is primarily used for agricultural activities such as growing crops and raising livestock. Therefore, the most appropriate answer would be one that directly relates to these activities.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Countryside - This refers to rural areas which could include farmland, but it is not specific to the use of farmland.\nB. Michigan - This is a state that may contain farmland, but it is too specific and does not directly relate to the use of farmland.\nC. North Dakota - Similar to Michigan, this is a state that may contain farmland, but it is too specific.\nD. Farming areas - This option directly relates to the use of farmland, as farming areas are specifically used for agriculture.\nE. Illinois - Another state that may contain farmland, but it is too specific.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. farming areas."}]
