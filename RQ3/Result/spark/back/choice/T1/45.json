This option does not fit the context of finding a ticket booth or seeing a concert.\n  \n- **B. indoors**: While many concerts are held indoors, this term is too broad and doesn't specify a location where a ticket booth would be found.\n\n- **C. movie theater**: Movie theaters have ticket booths, but they are specifically for movies, not concerts.\n\n- **D. venue**: A venue is a general term for any location where an event takes place. This could include concert halls, arenas, stadiums, and other places where concerts are held. It is also likely to have a ticket booth.\n\n- **E. auditorium**: An auditorium is a specific type of venue that can host concerts and other events. It would also have a ticket booth.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most appropriate answers would be D (venue) and E (auditorium), as both are locations where you would find a ticket booth and see a concert. However, since only one answer can be chosen, and \"venue\" is a broader term that encompasses \"auditorium,\" it is the best option.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. venue."}]
