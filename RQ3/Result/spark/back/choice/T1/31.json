Pop-up books are a type of children's book where illustrations pop out of the pages when the book is opened, creating a three-dimensional effect. This interactive feature allows readers to visualize and engage more deeply with the story being told.\n\nNow, let's evaluate each option:\n\nA. Giggle - While reading can be enjoyable and might make one giggle, it doesn't directly relate to the visual aspect of pop-up books.\nB. Visualize - Although pop-up books do help in visualization, this option doesn't specify the action that triggers the visualization.\nC. Open book - This is the correct answer as pop-up books reveal their stories through the pop-ups when the book is opened.\nD. Reading - Reading is an essential part of engaging with any book, but it doesn't specifically describe the action that makes pop-up books unique.\nE. Go to movies - This option is unrelated to pop-up books and their function.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. open book."}]
