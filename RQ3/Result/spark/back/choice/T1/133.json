Reusable shopping bags are typically used for carrying groceries or other items from a store to a person's residence. Therefore, when considering where someone might store such a bag, we should think about a place that is convenient for accessing it before going shopping and putting away after returning home.\n\nGiven the options:\n\nA. supermarket - This is not a suitable place for storing a personal reusable shopping bag as it would not be practical to leave it there permanently.\nB. home - This is a plausible option as people often keep their reusable bags at home for easy access when they need to go shopping.\nC. mart - This is similar to \"supermarket\" and is not an appropriate place for long-term storage of a personal reusable bag.\nD. obesity - This option is irrelevant to the context of the question as it does not pertain to storage locations.\nE. closet - This is also a plausible option as people might store their reusable bags in a closet at home for organizational purposes.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, both B (home) and E (closet) are reasonable answers. However, since the question asks for one final answer, we can choose either based on common practice.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n**B. home**"}]
