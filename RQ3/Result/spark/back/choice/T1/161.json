Flower bed** - This is not a marine environment and thus not a suitable habitat for anemones.\n- **B. Tide pool** - While tide pools can contain various marine organisms, they are generally not the primary habitat for anemones.\n- **C. Florida Keys** - The Florida Keys are known for their coral reefs and marine biodiversity, making them a prime location for finding anemones.\n- **D. Coral sea** - While the term \"coral sea\" could imply a suitable environment, it is not specific to the eastern U.S.\n- **E. Aquarium** - Anemones can be found in aquariums, but this does not specify a natural habitat off the eastern U.S.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nConsidering the natural habitat and geographic relevance, the most appropriate answer is the Florida Keys.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. Florida Keys."}]
