A smile is generally associated with happiness, joy, or contentment. Therefore, we need to find an option that logically connects a smile to an expression of happiness.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Manual - A manual is a set of instructions or guidelines, which has no direct connection to emotions like happiness.\nB. Rainbow - A rainbow is often seen as a symbol of hope or beauty but doesn't directly relate to the emotion of happiness in this context.\nC. Cry - While crying can be associated with sadness, it can also be a result of overwhelming happiness (tears of joy), which could be indicated by a smile.\nD. Frown - A frown typically indicates sadness, displeasure, or disapproval, which contrasts with the emotion of happiness.\nE. Make others happy too - This option suggests a cause-and-effect relationship where someone's happiness leads them to make others happy as well. However, it doesn't directly explain the emotion behind the smile itself.\n\nConsidering the options and their connections to happiness, the most fitting answer would be the one that directly links a smile to happiness. Since a smile can indicate tears of joy, which are a form of expressing happiness, option C. cry seems to be the most appropriate choice.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **C. cry**."}]
