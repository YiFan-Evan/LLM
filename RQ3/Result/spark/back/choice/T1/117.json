The options given are:\n\n- E. doctor's office\n- D. graveyard\n- C. elderly person\n- B. hospital\n- A. sick person\n\nWe can analyze each option in relation to the man's fear of illness:\n\n- **E. doctor's office**: This is a place where people go when they are ill or for medical check-ups. It is directly related to illness, so it makes sense that someone with a fear of illness would avoid this place.\n- **D. graveyard**: While a graveyard is associated with death, it is not necessarily a place where one would encounter illness.\n- **C. elderly person**: Being elderly does not necessarily mean being sick. An elderly person can be perfectly healthy.\n- **B. hospital**: Hospitals are places where sick people are treated. However, they are also places where people go for various other medical reasons, such as surgeries or check-ups, which might not always be related to being currently ill.\n- **A. sick person**: This option directly relates to the man's fear of illness. If someone is sick, they have an illness, and someone with a fear of illness would likely avoid them.\n\nConsidering the man's fear of illness, the most direct and logical option that he would avoid is visiting a \"sick person.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. sick person."}]
