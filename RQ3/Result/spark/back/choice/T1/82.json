These flowers are located on the trunk and limbs of the tree.

These flowers are located on the branches of the apple tree.\n2. **Pollination:** After pollination, these flowers develop into fruits.\n3. **Growth:** The fruits (apples) grow from the fertilized flowers and mature over time.\n\nGiven these principles, let's evaluate the options:\n- A. South Africa: This is a geographical location, not a part of the apple tree.\n- B. Sunshine: Sunshine is essential for photosynthesis but does not directly relate to where apples form on the tree.\n- C. New York: Like South Africa, this is a geographical location.\n- D. Bloom: This refers to the flowering stage, which is correct in terms of where apples start to form, but it is not a physical part of the tree.\n- E. Trunk: The trunk supports the tree and its branches, where the flowers (and eventually the apples) grow.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. bloom"}]
