He leaps up to a place where the dog can't reach him, but he ends up being stuck there.\n\n2. **Analyzing Each Option**:\n   - **A. Kennel**: A kennel is typically a confined space for dogs. It's unlikely that Billy would be able to leap into a kennel to escape a dog, and even if he did, it wouldn't necessarily trap him.\n   - **B. Table**: Leaping onto a table could be a possible action if Billy is in an indoor setting. However, tables are not usually high enough to completely prevent a dog from reaching him, unless the dog is very small or the table is very tall.\n   - **C. Porch**: A porch might be elevated, but it's generally open and not a place where one would get trapped easily.\n   - **D. Backyard**: A backyard is an outdoor area and doesn't provide specific details about any structures or places where Billy could get trapped after leaping.\n   - **E. Park**: A park is an outdoor area similar to a backyard, without specific details about structures that could lead to Billy getting trapped.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Given the options, the most likely place where Billy could leap to avoid a dog and end up being stuck is **B. Table**, assuming it's an indoor scenario and the table is high enough to keep the dog at bay but not designed to hold weight for long periods, leading to Billy being \"stuck.\"\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
