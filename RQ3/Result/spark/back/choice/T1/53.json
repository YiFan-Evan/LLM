It suggests resilience against breaking but not necessarily against other forms of destruction.\n\nGiven the context, \"Though the thin film seemed fragile,\" we are looking for an adjective that describes the film's ability to perform its intended purpose despite its delicate appearance. The word \"unbreakable\" (E) seems to strike a balance between implying strength and not being overly extreme.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. unbreakable."}]
