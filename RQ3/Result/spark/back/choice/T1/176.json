A shower curtain is typically used to contain water within a specific area during showering. Let's evaluate each option:\n\n1. **A. bathtub** - While a bathtub might have a shower curtain, it is not the most common place where you would find a single one being used, as bathtubs usually come with attached showerheads and may have fixed shower curtains or none at all.\n2. **B. washing area** - This option is vague and does not specifically indicate a place where a single shower curtain would be used.\n3. **C. hotel** - Hotels often have bathrooms with shower stalls that use shower curtains, but this option does not specify the exact location within the hotel where the curtain would be found.\n4. **D. shower stall** - This is the most logical choice. Shower stalls are designed for showering and often use a single shower curtain to keep water contained.\n5. **E. department store** - While department stores sell shower curtains, they are not places where a single shower curtain would be \"used\" in the sense of being hung up for showering purposes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. shower stall"}]
