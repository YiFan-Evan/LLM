Curtains are typically associated with stages, theaters, or auditoriums where events like plays, concerts, or movies are shown.\n\n2. **Options Analysis**:\n   - **A. airplane**: This option doesn't fit the context as airplanes do not have curtains that draw back for passengers to enjoy something.\n   - **B. movie**: While movies can be enjoyed in a cinema, the drawing back of curtains is not a typical feature of modern movie theaters.\n   - **C. auditorium**: Auditoriums often have stages with curtains, but they are more general spaces that can host various events, not specifically tied to enjoying a performance.\n   - **D. theatre**: Theatres have stages with curtains and are designed for performances, making this a strong contender.\n   - **E. show**: This is the most direct answer as it encompasses any form of performance or event that one might enjoy after the curtains are drawn back.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the context provided and the analysis of each option, the most fitting answer is the one that directly relates to enjoying an event after the curtains are drawn.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **E. show**."}]
