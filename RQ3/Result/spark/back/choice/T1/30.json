Poisonous gas - Inhaling poisonous gas can cause immediate or delayed death depending on the type and concentration of the gas.\nB. Homicide - Being a victim of homicide results in death by another person's actions.\nC. Cinder - While cinder itself is not typically lethal, it could cause injury or death in specific scenarios such as inhalation or severe burns.\nD. Nuclear weapons - The use of nuclear weapons can cause mass casualties due to blast effects, radiation, and long-term environmental damage.\nE.

Poisonous gas - Inhaling certain poisonous gases like carbon monoxide or cyanogen can cause rapid death due to their toxic effects.\nB. Homicide - Being a victim of homicide results in death by another person's actions, which can be immediate or delayed depending on the method used.\nC. Cinder - While cinder itself is not typically lethal, it could cause injury or death in specific scenarios such as severe burns or inhalation.\nD. Nuclear weapons - The use of nuclear weapons can cause mass casualties due to blast effects, radiation, and long-term environmental damage.\nE. Cyanide - Cyanide is a highly toxic substance that can cause rapid death if ingested, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin.\n\nConsidering the direct and immediate lethality, cyanide (E) and poisonous gas (A) are the most likely causes of early death among the options provided. However, cyanide is often considered more immediately deadly due to its rapid action when ingested or inhaled.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E."}]
