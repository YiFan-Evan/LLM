A basketball is typically inflated with air to maintain its shape and bounce. If a basketball has a hole, air can escape, which would affect its ability to remain fully inflated.\n\nLet's evaluate each option:\n\nA. punctured - This would be true because having a hole means the basketball has been punctured.\nB. popular in America - This would still be true as the popularity of basketball in America is not affected by the condition of one basketball.\nC. full of air - This would not be true if the basketball has a hole, as the air would have escaped through the hole.\nD. gone - This would not be true because the basketball still exists, even if it has a hole.\nE. round - This would still be true as the basketball would not lose its general shape, implying it still retains its roundness.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nC. full of air"}]
