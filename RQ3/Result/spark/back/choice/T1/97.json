Neuroepithelium is a type of tissue found in various parts of the body, including the inner ear, which plays a crucial role in maintaining balance. When someone becomes nervous or anxious, it can affect their physical stability, especially if there are issues with their inner ear function.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. Tastebud: Not related to balance.\n- B. Retina: Related to vision, not balance.\n- C. Inner ear: Contains neuroepithelial cells and is responsible for balance.\n- D. Nasal cavity: Not directly related to balance.\n- E. Autistic: Autism is a developmental disorder, not directly related to balance issues unless specified otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC. inner ear"}]
