It refers to the sunset, which is a completely different context.\n- Option B: \"near\" - If you are near something that is rising, it implies you are at a similar level or slightly below it.\n- Option C: \"fall\" - This option is irrelevant to the context of seeing something rise.\n- Option D: \"below\" - Logically, if you see something rising, it means you are positioned below it.\n- Option E: \"lower\" - This is similar to being below but not as precise in describing the relative position.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is that when you see something rise, you are below it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D."}]
