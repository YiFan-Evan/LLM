This is a fundamental biological principle that applies to all living organisms. The other options do not accurately describe what happens immediately upon birth. Expiration (A) refers to the act of breathing out, which occurs continuously throughout life but is not specific to the moment of birth. Death (D) is the cessation of life processes, which obviously does not occur at birth. \"Sometimes bad\" (C) is not a clear or relevant option in this context. Starting reproduction (E) typically occurs much later in the life cycle of most organisms, after they have reached maturity.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. growing older."}]
