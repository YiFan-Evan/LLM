Dauntless**: This means fearless or undaunted. While a lion might be fearless, this term alone doesn't necessarily indicate an attitude towards a perceived timid competitor.\n2. **D. Aggressive**: This implies a hostile or forceful approach, which is a likely reaction if the lion senses weakness in his competitor.\n3. **C. Defensive**: This suggests a posture of protection or defense, which is less likely if the lion perceives the competitor as timid.\n4. **B. Bellicose**: This means aggressively hostile or eager to fight, which is also a possible reaction but slightly more specific than just being aggressive.\n5. **A. Reckless**: This implies a lack of caution or care, which doesn't align well with sensing timidity in a competitor.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most fitting attitude for the lion in this scenario would be one that reflects dominance and readiness to confront or intimidate the timid competitor.
