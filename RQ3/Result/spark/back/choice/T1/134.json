This is not a common source of gum on shoes.\n\n2. **Movies (B)**: While people might chew gum in a movie theater, it's less likely that gum would end up on your shoe in this setting compared to other outdoor places.\n\n3. **Sidewalk (C)**: Sidewalks are a very common place for gum to be found. People often dispose of their gum by sticking it on the sidewalk, making it a frequent source of gum on shoes.\n\n4. **Water Fountain (D)**: Gum is not typically associated with water fountains. It's unlikely that gum from a water fountain would end up on your shoe.\n\n5. **Table (E)**: Similar to a shelf, a table is not a common place for gum to be found, especially in a way that would transfer to your shoe.\n\nFundamentally, the most logical place where gum would likely come from to end up on your shoe is the sidewalk, as people frequently discard gum there, and it can easily stick to the bottom of shoes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nC. sidewalk"}]
