Given the options, we need to find the word that best fits the blank to complete the sentence in a way that makes sense with the context of being \"very outgoing.\"\n\n- A. scary - This option implies that making friends is something frightening, which contradicts the idea of being outgoing.\n- B. having friends - This option is redundant because it repeats the idea of making friends without adding any new information about the nature of the act.\n- C. good feeling - This option is positive but does not fit the structure of the sentence, as it does not describe a lack of something negative.\n- D. conflict - This option suggests that making friends would not involve any struggle or problem, which aligns with the idea of being outgoing and socially comfortable.\n- E. friendship - This option is similar to B, as it refers to the result of making friends rather than the process itself.\n\nConsidering the above analysis, the most appropriate word to fill in the blank is \"conflict,\" as it suggests that making friends was not a struggle for him, which is consistent with being outgoing.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **D. conflict**."}]
