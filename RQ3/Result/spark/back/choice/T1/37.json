This situation is best described by \"direct sunlight.\" While options like \"full sunlight\" and \"bright sunshine\" also describe sunny conditions, they don't specifically convey the idea of being exposed without any barrier between the sun and the person, which is what \"direct sunlight\" implies. Therefore, the final answer is: E. direct sunlight."}]
