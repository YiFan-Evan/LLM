This means the plane will no longer have the forward propulsion it needs to maintain altitude or speed. The fundamental principles involved here are those of aerodynamics and physics:\n\n1. **Lack of Thrust**: Without engine power, the plane can't generate the necessary thrust to counteract drag and maintain its current altitude or speed.\n2. **Loss of Lift**: As the plane slows down, the wings will generate less lift, which could lead to a stall if not managed properly.\n3. **Descent**: The plane will start to descend due to gravity and the loss of lift.\n4. **Glide**: If managed correctly, the plane can glide towards a landing spot, but this requires skillful piloting and depends on the altitude and conditions at the time of engine failure.\n5. **Emergency Procedures**: Pilots are trained to handle such situations through emergency procedures, including using auxiliary power units (APUs) if available, and following specific protocols to land safely.\n\nGiven these principles, the most likely outcome if the engines cut off and cannot be restarted is that the plane will begin to descend and could potentially crash if not handled properly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nD. crash"}]
