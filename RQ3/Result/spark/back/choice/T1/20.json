While they may offer more space and fewer neighbors compared to urban areas, they are still part of a planned community and thus not completely free of neighbors.\n\n2. **Woods (D)**: Living in the woods can provide a high degree of isolation. Depending on the density of the forest and the location, it is possible to have very few, if any, neighbors.\n\n3. **Mars (C)**: While Mars is an extreme example of isolation, it is currently not a viable option for human habitation due to the lack of necessary life support systems and infrastructure.\n\n4. **Neighborhood (B)**: A neighborhood is a community of homes, which inherently means there will be neighbors living nearby.\n\n5. **Housing Estate (A)**: A housing estate is similar to a neighborhood, consisting of multiple residences close to each other. This option also implies having neighbors.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most suitable option for someone wanting no neighbors would be:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nD. woods"}]
