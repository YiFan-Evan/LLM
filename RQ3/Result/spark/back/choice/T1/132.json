However, it doesn't necessarily follow that you would spend it all within a few hours.\n\n3. **C. getting paid** - This option suggests that you are receiving money for work or services rendered. While this could happen after cashing in your cash, it doesn't directly relate to the act of cashing in cash itself.\n\n4. **B. receiving money** - This is similar to getting paid but more general. It could mean receiving money from various sources, not just from work or services.\n\n5. **A. happy** - This option suggests an emotional state rather than an action. While cashing in your cash could lead to happiness, it's not a direct consequence of the act itself.\n\nConsidering the options, the most direct and logical consequence of cashing in your cash would be having money to spend. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. spending money."}]
