Record album - Bands often record their music in a controlled environment without an audience present. This could be for creating demos, final recordings, or live albums.\nB. Play music - This is a general statement and does not necessarily explain why there are no people nearby.\nC. Hold concert - Concerts usually have an audience, so this option doesn't fit if there are no people nearby.\nD. Blaring - This typically refers to loud noise that might disturb others, but it doesn't explain why a band would be playing without an audience.\nE. Practice - Bands practice to improve their skills and prepare for performances with an audience. Practicing without an audience is common.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. record album"}]
