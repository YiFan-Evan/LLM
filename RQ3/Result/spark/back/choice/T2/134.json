It can also be found in places like movie theaters, where people may stick gum under seats or tables.\n\n2. **Transfer Mechanism**: Gum can transfer to your shoe if you step on it while walking or standing. This is more likely to happen on a sidewalk than on a table, water fountain, movies, or shelf.\n\n3. **Probability**: Considering the likelihood of gum being present and the ease with which it can transfer to your shoe, sidewalks are the most probable source.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC. sidewalk"}]
