The first step in opening any physical establishment is securing a suitable location. Without a building or space to operate from, you cannot proceed with other aspects such as purchasing equipment, hiring staff, or even applying for necessary permits and licenses.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given options:\n\nA. Building - This is the most logical choice as it represents the physical space required to set up the steakhouse.\nB. Texas - While Texas is known for its cattle ranches and barbecue, choosing a specific state like Texas does not address the immediate need for a location to start your business.\nC. Wine - Wine is an accompaniment to meals but is not essential for the initial setup of a steakhouse.\nD. Florida - Similar to Texas, Florida is a state and not a specific location for your business.\nE. Michigan - Again, this is another state and not a specific location for setting up your steakhouse.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **A. building**."}]
