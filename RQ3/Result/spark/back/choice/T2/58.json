Corners are typically the most challenging areas to paint neatly because they require sharp angles and clean edges to ensure a professional finish. The other options like interior, center, middle, and triangle do not specifically indicate areas where extra care for clean lines would be needed.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. corner"}]
