Sloths are native to the tropical forests of Central and South America. They thrive in environments that provide plenty of trees for climbing and dense foliage for camouflage and protection from predators.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Countryside - This option is too vague and does not specify a tropical environment.\nB. Transit - This term typically refers to transportation and is not a living environment for animals.\nC. Work - This is irrelevant to the question as it does not describe a natural habitat.\nD. Manual - This is also irrelevant and does not describe a natural habitat.\nE. Tropical jungle - This is the correct answer as it accurately describes the natural habitat of sloths.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. Tropical jungle."}]
