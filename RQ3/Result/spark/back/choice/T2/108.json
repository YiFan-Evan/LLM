It is more about being quiet.\n- B. pay attention: Listening intensely implies focusing on what is being said, which aligns with paying attention.\n- C. get attention: This is more about seeking attention from others and not necessarily related to intensely listening to a lecture.\n- D. concentrate: Intensity suggests a high level of focus or concentration, making this a strong candidate.\n- E. gain confidence: While gaining confidence can be a byproduct of understanding the material, it is not the primary goal of intensely listening to a lecture.\n\nThe fundamental principle involved here is that intense listening requires focus and mental effort to understand the content. Therefore, the most fitting options are B. pay attention and D. concentrate. However, since \"intensely\" suggests a higher degree of engagement, the best match is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **D. concentrate**."}]
