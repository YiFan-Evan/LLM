To determine which option correctly identifies another type of tax situation, we need to consider the context of when taxes are due and whether they have been paid or are still due.\n\nLet's analyze the options:\n\nA. **current** - This term suggests taxes that are due now or for the current period. If Joe has back taxes, it is likely he also has current taxes due, as people usually have ongoing tax obligations.\nB. **front** - This is not a standard tax term and does not provide clear information about the nature of the taxes.\nC. **main** - Similarly, this is not a standard term used in the context of taxes.\nD. **front** - Duplicate of option B, already explained.\nE. **anterior** - This term is not commonly used in the context of taxes and does not provide clear information about the nature of the taxes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. current."}]
