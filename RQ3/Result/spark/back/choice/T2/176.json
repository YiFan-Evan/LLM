A shower curtain is usually placed in an area where water might splash out during bathing or showering.\n\n- **Option A (department store)**: This is where you would buy a shower curtain, not where it would be used.\n- **Option B (shower stall)**: This is a common place for a single shower curtain to be used, as it helps contain the water within the stall.\n- **Option C (hotel)**: While hotels do have showers, they often have multiple rooms with showers, making this option less specific than Option B.\n- **Option D (washing area)**: This could refer to a laundry room or similar space, which would not typically use a shower curtain.\n- **Option E (bathtub)**: Bathtubs can also use shower curtains, especially if they are used for both bathing and showering. However, a shower stall is more commonly associated with a single shower curtain.\n\nConsidering the typical use of a single shower curtain, the most logical answer would be:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
