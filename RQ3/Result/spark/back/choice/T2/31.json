Old style pop-ups are typically found in children's books where illustrations pop out when a page is turned or opened.\n2. The action of turning or opening a page in such a book would reveal these pop-up illustrations.\n3. The other options (giggle, visualize, reading, go to movies) do not directly relate to physically interacting with a pop-up book in a way that would make the illustrations appear.\n\nGiven these principles, the correct answer would be the action that allows you to see the story by interacting with the physical book.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. open book."}]
