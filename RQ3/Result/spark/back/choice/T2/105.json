This is a likely outcome as media outlets often cover stories involving celebrities to engage their audience.\n\nB. **Getting high** - This option does not logically follow from going public about a common problem. It is unrelated to the context of the question.\n\nC. **Pain** - While discussing a common problem might evoke empathy or understanding, it doesn't necessarily mean the celebrity will experience physical pain. This option seems out of context.\n\nD. **A degree** - There is no direct correlation between going public about a common problem and earning an academic degree. This option is irrelevant to the situation described.\n\nE. **Wide acceptance** - By going public about a common problem, a celebrity might gain wide acceptance from the public. People tend to support individuals who openly share their struggles, fostering a sense of connection and relatability.\n\nConsidering the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem, the most logical outcome is gaining **press coverage** (Option A) because it is directly related to the action of going public, which typically involves media involvement.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **A. press coverage**."}]
