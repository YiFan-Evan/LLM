Neuroepithelium is a type of tissue found in sensory organs, including the inner ear. The inner ear plays a crucial role in maintaining balance.\n\nThe options provided are:\nA. autistic - This term refers to a developmental disorder and does not directly relate to the nervous system's functioning related to balance.\nB. nasal cavity - This is not involved in maintaining balance.\nC. inner ear - This contains neuroepithelial cells and is responsible for balance.\nD. retina - This is part of the eye and not involved in balance.\nE. tastebud - This is involved in taste and not in balance.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nC. inner ear"}]
