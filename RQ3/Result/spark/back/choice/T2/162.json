It might be affected, but it's not the direct consequence we're looking for here.\n   - **C. fidelity**: Fidelity refers to faithfulness in a relationship. An affair directly breaches fidelity, so this could be a strong candidate for the answer.\n   - **D. marriage**: The marriage itself doesn't end just because an affair is discovered; it's the potential trust and commitment within the marriage that are affected.\n   - **E. relationship**: This is a bit vague and could refer to the extramarital relationship or the marital relationship. However, it doesn't specifically address the direct consequence of the affair being discovered.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Based on the context and analysis, the most direct and appropriate answer to the question would be that the affair ended the fidelity upon its discovery by her husband.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. fidelity"}]
