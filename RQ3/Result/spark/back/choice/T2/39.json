They do not typically require tickets for seating.\n2. **Movies**: Movie theaters usually require tickets for entry, but these are generally for admission rather than specific seats within the theater.\n3. **Auditorium**: Auditoriums can host various events such as lectures, performances, or meetings, and tickets may be required for entry or for specific seats.\n4. **Show**: Shows, whether they are concerts, theater performances, or sports events, often require tickets for specific seats to ensure proper allocation of space and revenue generation.\n5. **Park**: Parks are open public spaces where people can relax and enjoy outdoor activities. They do not typically require tickets for seating.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most appropriate answer would be an event that specifically involves purchasing tickets for individual seats to guarantee a particular spot in the venue.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. show"}]
