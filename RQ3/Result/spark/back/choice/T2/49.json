Panic**: This refers to a sudden, overwhelming fear or anxiety. It is not directly related to feeling lonely or isolated in a crowd.\n- **B. Solitude**: This means being alone or in a place without other people. While it can imply loneliness, it doesn't necessarily describe the feeling of being alone in a crowd.\n- **C. Solitary**: This term describes someone who is alone or isolated from others. It can be used to describe a person who feels lonely even when they are surrounded by people.\n- **D. Alone**: This directly indicates the feeling of being without company or support. It is a strong contender for describing how a depressed man might feel despite being in a large crowd.\n- **E. Small group**: This refers to the size of a group, not a feeling. It does not fit the context of the question.\n\nGiven these analyses, the most appropriate answer that fits the context of a depressed man feeling isolated in a large crowd would be:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. alone"}]
