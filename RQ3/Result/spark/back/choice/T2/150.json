Depending on the altitude and situation, this can lead to a loss of lift and potentially a stall, where the aircraft no longer has the speed to maintain lift. A stall can result in a rapid descent, which could potentially lead to a crash if the pilots cannot regain control or glide the aircraft to a safe landing spot.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer is:\nE. stall"}]
