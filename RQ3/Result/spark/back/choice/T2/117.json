The man has a fear of illness, which means he would avoid places or situations related to illness.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. doctor's office - A doctor's office is a place where people go to see a doctor for medical advice or treatment. Since the man has a fear of illness, visiting a doctor's office might be associated with his fear. However, it's not the most direct association with illness itself.\n\nB. graveyard - A graveyard is a place where people are buried after they have died. While it is associated with death, it is not directly related to illness.\n\nC. elderly person - An elderly person is someone who is old in age. Being old does not necessarily mean being sick, so this option is not directly related to the man's fear of illness.\n\nD. hospital - A hospital is a place where sick people go for treatment. This option is directly related to illness as hospitals are where people go when they are ill.\n\nE. sick person - A sick person is someone who is currently ill. This option is directly related to the man's fear of illness, as he would naturally avoid contact with someone who is sick.\n\nConsidering the context and the options, the most appropriate answer would be the one that is most directly related to the man's fear of illness.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. sick person."}]
