Suburbs - Suburbs are residential areas that typically have houses with yards and some level of privacy, but they usually have neighbors.\n\nB. Woods - Living in the woods can offer significant isolation, as there are no immediate neighbors. It is a more natural setting and can provide the solitude someone desires.\n\nC. Marsh (assuming \"mars\" was a typo) - A marsh is a wetland area that may be sparsely populated, but it might not be practical for living due to its wet and potentially unstable conditions.\n\nD. Neighborhood - By definition, a neighborhood consists of homes with neighbors nearby.\n\nE. Housing estate - This term generally refers to a large residential development with multiple homes, which would include neighbors.\n\nConsidering the need for no neighbors, the best option is:\n\nB. woods\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B."}]
