It's a logical choice because kitchens are designed for food and beverage preparation.\n\n2. **Washing (B)**: This option seems unrelated to making coffee. Washing usually refers to cleaning clothes or dishes, not preparing beverages.\n\n3. **Table (C)**: While some people might prepare instant coffee at a table, it's less common than using a kitchen for making coffee from scratch.\n\n4. **Office (D)**: Some offices have coffee machines, but not everyone works in an office that provides this convenience.\n\n5. **Coffee Shop (E)**: Coffee shops are places where people go to purchase coffee, not to make it themselves.\n\nBased on these considerations, the most logical place where most people would make coffee is the kitchen, as it is equipped with the necessary tools and ingredients.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. kitchen."}]
