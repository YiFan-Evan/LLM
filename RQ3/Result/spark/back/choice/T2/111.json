Cleaning a house is a physically demanding task that can lead to various physical responses, especially when done for an extended period.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. Sneezing - While it's possible to sneeze while cleaning due to dust or allergens, it's not a direct consequence of prolonged cleaning.\nB. Exhaustion - Prolonged physical activity can lead to exhaustion, which is a state of extreme fatigue and weariness.\nC. Order - This is a result of cleaning, not a consequence for the person doing the cleaning.\nD. Tiredness - This is a likely outcome of prolonged physical activity, but \"exhaustion\" is a stronger term that encompasses tiredness and more.\nE. Neatness - Similar to \"order,\" this is a result of cleaning, not a consequence for the cleaner.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. exhaustion."}]
