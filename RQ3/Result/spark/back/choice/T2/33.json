The sentence describes someone who is very outgoing, which typically means they are sociable and comfortable interacting with others. This trait makes forming friendships easier for them, implying that making friends is not a challenging or negative experience for them.\n\nGiven the options:\n- A. Friendship (doesn't make sense because \"friendship\" is a positive concept, and being outgoing would facilitate rather than hinder it)\n- B. Conflict (makes sense because if making friends was no conflict, it means it was easy for him, aligning with his outgoing nature)\n- C. Good feeling (irrelevant because the sentence is about ease of making friends, not the emotional outcome)\n- D. Having friends (circular reasoning; saying making friends is having friends doesn't add meaning)\n- E. Scary (opposite of outgoing; if he were scared, it would contradict his being outgoing)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **B. Conflict**."}]
