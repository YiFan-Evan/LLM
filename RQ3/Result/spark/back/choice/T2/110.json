This is a common and plausible reason.\n\nB. blaring - This option suggests making a loud noise, which doesn't necessarily explain why a band would be performing without an audience.\n\nC. hold concert - A concert typically implies an audience. If there are no people nearby, it wouldn't make sense to hold a concert.\n\nD. play music - While this is true, bands do play music, but this option doesn't provide a specific reason for doing so without an audience.\n\nE. record album - Bands might perform in a studio or a similar setting to record their music for an album. This is a plausible reason for performing without an immediate audience.\n\nConsidering the context and the options provided, both \"practice\" and \"record album\" are reasonable explanations. However, if we had to choose one based on the information given, \"record album\" would be the most specific reason for a band to perform without an audience nearby.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. record album."}]
