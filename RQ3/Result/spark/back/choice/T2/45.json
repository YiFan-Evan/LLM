Auditorium - An auditorium is a large room or hall for public meetings or performances, but it doesn't specifically imply that a concert will take place there.\nB. Venue - A venue is a specific place where an event occurs. It is the most appropriate option as it directly relates to the location where a concert would be held and where you would expect to find a ticket booth.\nC. Movie Theater - While a movie theater has a ticket booth, it is primarily associated with watching movies, not concerts.\nD. Indoors - This option is too vague and does not specify the type of indoor location.\nE. Clerk - A clerk is a person who works at a counter, not a place where you would find a ticket booth or see a concert.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. venue"}]
