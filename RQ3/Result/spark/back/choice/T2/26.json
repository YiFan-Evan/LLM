This is a very common and direct reason for a car to stop.\n   \n2. **Automobile Accidents (E)**: A car involved in an accident may become inoperable or unsafe to drive, which can immediately stop its operation.\n\n3. **Smoke (B)**: While smoke itself might be a symptom of an underlying issue, it doesn't directly prevent a car from driving unless it indicates a severe problem that stops the car.\n\n4. **Pollution (C)**: Pollution generally refers to environmental conditions rather than a direct cause for a specific car to stop driving.\n\n5. **Backache (D)**: Backache is related to the driver\u2019s health but is unlikely to directly prevent a car from driving unless it severely impairs the driver\u2019s ability to operate the vehicle.\n\nConsidering these points, the most direct and common reasons a car would stop driving are due to low fuel or being involved in an automobile accident.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nA. low fuel tank and E. automobile accidents."}]
