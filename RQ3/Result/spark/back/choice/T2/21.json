Elevation generally refers to a raised or elevated area, such as a hill or mountain. Therefore, the opposite would be an area that is not elevated but rather lowered or sunken.\n\nLet's examine the options:\n\nA. Diminishment - This generally means a reduction in size, amount, or importance but does not necessarily imply a lowering of an area.\nB. Demotion - This typically refers to a decrease in rank or status and is not related to geographical features.\nC. Depression - This can mean a low or sunken area, which makes it a suitable antonym for elevation.\nD. Reduction - Like diminishment, this usually refers to a decrease in size or amount and doesn't specifically imply a sunken area.\nE. Disgust - This is an emotional term unrelated to geographical features.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nC. depression"}]
