Therefore, having money (either in cash or other forms) is essential.\n\nConsidering the options, \"get money\" (option E) seems to be the most direct answer to the question about what someone must do before they shop, especially if they don't already have money. However, \"have money\" (option D) is also a correct answer, as it encompasses the idea that you need funds available for shopping.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nD. have money"}]
