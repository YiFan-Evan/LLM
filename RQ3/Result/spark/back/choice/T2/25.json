The key here is to identify where he would typically use public transportation, given that he needs a bag to carry his belongings.\n\n1. **Locker Room**: A locker room is generally used for changing clothes or storing personal items temporarily during activities like sports or gym workouts. It doesn't relate to the need for carrying things while using public transportation.\n   \n2. **Army Barracks**: Army barracks are living quarters for military personnel. This option doesn't fit the context of James needing a bag to carry his things while using public transportation.\n\n3. **Bus Station**: A bus station is a location where buses arrive and depart. While it is a place where one might use a duffel bag to carry belongings, it is not the mode of transportation itself.\n\n4. **Transit**: Transit refers to the act of moving from one place to another, usually by means of public transportation such as buses, trains, or subways. This option fits the context of James needing a bag to carry his things while using public transportation.\n\n5. **Library**: A library is a place for reading and borrowing books. It does not relate to the need for carrying things while using public transportation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. transit."}]
