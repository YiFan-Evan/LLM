This indicates that the place he leaped to is elevated or otherwise inaccessible to the dog.\n\n2. **Evaluating the Options**:\n   - A. **Park**: A park is an open outdoor space, and it's unlikely that Billy would find a place to leap to that the dog couldn't reach in a park.\n   - B. **Backyard**: Similar to a park, a backyard is typically open, and there wouldn't be many places for Billy to leap to that the dog couldn't reach.\n   - C. **Porch**: A porch might have railings or steps, but it's less likely to be a place where Billy would get stuck after leaping.\n   - D. **Table**: A table is an elevated surface that a person could leap onto to avoid a dog. However, getting stuck on a table is less common unless it's a specific situation like a high table or one with obstacles around it.\n   - E. **Kennel**: A kennel is a confined space designed for dogs. It's unlikely that Billy would leap into a kennel to avoid a dog, as it would be more of a trap than a safe place.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Considering the options and the scenario, the most plausible place where Billy might have been trapped after leaping to avoid the dog is a **table**, especially if it's a high or enclosed one where he could get stuck.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. table."}]
