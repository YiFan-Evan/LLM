Carnival - A carnival is a festival featuring rides, games, and other entertainment. While there may be some talking involved, it is not primarily focused on conversation.\nC. Sing - Singing is an activity that involves producing musical sounds with the voice, but it is not typically associated with conversational talking.\nD. State park - A state park is a public recreation area managed by the state government. It does not inherently involve talking as a primary activity.\nE. Confession - A confession is an act of admitting something, especially a wrongdoing or sin, to someone else, often a priest or religious leader. It directly involves talking as the individual confesses their thoughts and actions to another person.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. confession."}]
