Backpack - It is unlikely that a backpack would have a bath towel available for borrowing unless it's a very large and well-equipped backpack.\nB. Clothes line - A clothes line is typically used to hang laundry, including towels, after they have been washed, not to borrow them.\nC. Swimming pool - Swimming pools may have towels available for use, but they are usually provided by the facility itself rather than being \"borrowed\" from someone else.\nD. At hotel - Hotels often provide bath towels for their guests as part of their amenities. This makes it a likely place to borrow a bath towel if needed.\nE. Cupboard - While a cupboard could potentially hold a bath towel, it is less likely to be a place where one could easily borrow a towel compared to a hotel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. at hotel"}]
