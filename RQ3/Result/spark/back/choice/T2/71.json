The planet has extreme temperatures, ranging from very hot during the day to extremely cold at night, and it lacks a breathable atmosphere. These conditions make it impossible for humans to survive there."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The planet Mercury is unsuitable for human life or what?\nOptions: A. jupiter B. poisonous C. mercury sulphide D. uninhabitable E. toxic"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The fundamental principles involved in solving this question involve understanding the characteristics that make a planet suitable or unsuitable for human life. For humans to live on a planet, it generally needs a breathable atmosphere, water, and a moderate temperature range. Mercury is known to have extreme temperatures and lacks an atmosphere capable of supporting human life.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. uninhabitable."}]
