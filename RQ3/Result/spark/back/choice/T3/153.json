Curtains are not typically associated with airplanes or auditoriums.\n\n3. \"I enjoyed the what?\" - This part of the sentence is asking for the object of enjoyment, which should be something visual or performative given the context.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Airplane - An airplane would not have curtains to draw back, so this option does not fit.\nB. Movie - While movies can be enjoyed in a setting with curtains, the phrase \"curtains drew back\" is more commonly associated with a live performance.\nC. Auditorium - An auditorium may have seating and could host various events, but it's less specific than the other options.\nD. Theatre - A theatre has curtains and is designed for performances, which fits the context of the sentence.\nE. Show - A show could be any kind of performance, including a play, concert, or movie. However, without more context, it's less specific than \"theatre.\"\n\nConsidering the details provided, the most fitting answer would be related to a place where curtains are drawn back for a performance. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. theatre"}]
