While race tracks are designed for high-speed driving, it's not a common place for everyday car travel. Freeways, on the other hand, are specifically designed to accommodate high-speed traffic and are commonly used by cars for long-distance travel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nA. freeway"}]
