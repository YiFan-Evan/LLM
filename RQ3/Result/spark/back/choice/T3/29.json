Let's clarify the reasoning behind the correct answer:\n\n1. **Understanding the Question**: The question asks where a parent would have to go if their child brings home a list of supplies like paper and pencils from class.\n\n2. **Evaluating Options**:\n   - A. Classroom: While parents might receive the list in the classroom, this is not where they would typically purchase supplies.\n   - B. Parking Garage: This location has no relevance to purchasing school supplies.\n   - C. Store: This is the most logical place where parents would go to buy items like paper and pencils.\n   - D. Backpack: This refers to where students carry their supplies, not where parents purchase them.\n   - E. Cabinet: Typically, this is where household items are stored, not where new supplies are purchased.\n\n3. **Selecting the Best Option**: Based on common sense and typical behavior, parents would need to go to a store to purchase the listed supplies.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. store"}]
