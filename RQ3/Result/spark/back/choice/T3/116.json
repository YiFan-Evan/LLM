Let's analyze the options more sensibly:\n\n- A. cupboard: Typically, a cupboard is used for storage and would not be a place where bath towels are borrowed.\n- B. at hotel: Hotels provide bath towels for guests, making it a common place to borrow one.\n- C. swimming pool: While some swimming pools may have towels available for rent or provide them as part of a service, it is less common than at a hotel.\n- D. clothes line: A clothes line is used for drying clothes and would not be a place to borrow a bath towel.\n- E. backpack: A backpack is a portable bag and not a location where bath towels are typically borrowed.\n\nGiven these considerations, the most logical place to borrow a bath towel is still:\n\nB. at hotel\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B"}]
