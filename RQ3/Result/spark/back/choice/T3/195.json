This could be a building you own or lease.\n\n4. **Menu and Concept**: Developing a menu and concept that will attract customers is essential.\n\n5. **Equipment and Supplies**: Purchasing kitchen equipment, utensils, and initial supplies is necessary to start cooking and serving food.\n\nGiven these principles, let's evaluate the options:\n\n- A. michigan: This option suggests a location in Michigan. While choosing a state is important, it's not the first thing you should get when opening a steakhouse.\n- B. florida: Similar to Michigan, this suggests a location in Florida.

Not the first thing to get.\n- E. building: This option suggests acquiring a building or space for your steakhouse. This is one of the first things you need to do before you can start setting up your business.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. building."}]
