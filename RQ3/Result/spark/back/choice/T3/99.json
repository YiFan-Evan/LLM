Istanbul - This is a city in Turkey and not a place where one would go for immediate help or comfort when feeling unwell.\nB. Concert - A concert is a social event that is not suitable for someone feeling chest tightness and worried about their health.\nC. Bedroom - A bedroom is a personal space where one can lie down and rest, making it a more appropriate choice if one doesn't want to go to the hospital but needs to take care of their health.\nD. Antique shop - An antique shop is a commercial establishment and not a place where one would go for help or comfort when feeling ill.\nE. Human being - This option is not a location and therefore does not make sense in the context of where Jodie might go.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\nC. bedroom"}]
