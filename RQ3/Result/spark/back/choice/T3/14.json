Punctured: This would be true because if there is a hole in the basketball, it means the ball has been punctured.\n\nB. Popular in America: This statement is irrelevant to the condition of the basketball having a hole. The popularity of basketball in America is not affected by the presence of a hole in the ball.\n\nC. Full of air: This would not be true because if the basketball has a hole, the air inside would escape, meaning it cannot be full of air.\n\nD. Gone: This is irrelevant and does not make sense in the context of the question. The existence of a hole does not imply that the basketball is gone.\n\nE. Round: This would still be true because even with a hole, the basketball maintains its general shape, which is round.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nC. full of air"}]
