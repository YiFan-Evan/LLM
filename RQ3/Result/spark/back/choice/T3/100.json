Let's evaluate each option:\n\n- A. Hotel: Hotels can vary greatly in size, but many do have elevators, especially if they have multiple floors. Therefore, it is less likely to be the correct answer.\n- B. Kitchen: Kitchens are generally found within homes or restaurants and do not typically have elevators. However, kitchens usually do not contain telephone books either.\n- C. Library: Libraries can range from small local branches to large multi-story buildings. While some libraries might have elevators, they often contain telephone books for public use. This makes it a plausible option.\n- D. Telephone Booth: Telephone booths are standalone structures designed for making phone calls. They do not have elevators by design and often contain a telephone book. This makes them a strong candidate for the correct answer.\n- E. House: Houses can vary in size and design, but most single-family houses do not have elevators. However, having a telephone book in a house is less common nowadays due to the prevalence of smartphones and digital directories.\n\nConsidering these factors, the most fitting answer would be a place that is specifically designed without an elevator and is known for sometimes containing a telephone book.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. telephone booth."}]
