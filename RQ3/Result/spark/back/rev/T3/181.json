It uses a queue to manage the nodes to be explored and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. **Path Recording**: Each time a node is dequeued, its neighbors are enqueued along with the path taken to reach them. This ensures that when the destination node is reached, the complete path is available.\n4. **Result Formatting**: The resulting path is formatted"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 7], [0, 24], [1, 4], [2, 16], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 15], [3, 19], [4, 6], [5, 18], [6, 21], [7, 13], [8, 20], [8, 14], [9, 23], [10, 23], [10, 13], [11, 12], [11, 23], [14, 23], [17, 18], [18, 22], [19, 23], [20, 21]]} The start node: 23 The destination: To find the shortest path from node 23 to node 19 in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

We also maintain a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes.\n- **Exploration**: We dequeue a node from the front of the queue and check if it is the goal node. If it is, we return the path. Otherwise, we mark it as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors along with the updated path.\n- **Termination**: The loop continues until we find the goal node or exhaust all possibilities.\n\n### Output:\nWhen you run the above code, it will print the shortest path from node 23 to node 19 in the specified format."}]
