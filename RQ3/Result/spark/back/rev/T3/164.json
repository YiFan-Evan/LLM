We also initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n2. **BFS Loop**: We loop until the queue is empty. In each iteration, we dequeue a node and check if it is the goal node. If it is, we return the path. Otherwise, we mark the node as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors along with the updated path.\n3. **Path Construction**: For each neighbor, we construct a new path by adding the neighbor to the current path and enqueue it.\n\n### Result:\nRunning the above code will give us the shortest path from node 2 to node 20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```plaintext\nThe shortest path"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 10], [3, 16], [3, 18], [3, 24], [4, 19], [5, 8], [5, 15], [5, 18], [6, 24], [7, 10], [7, 9], [9, 20], [9, 13], [9, 23], [11, 17], [11, 12], [12, 15], [13, 19], [14, 22], [17, 21], [19, 22], [21, 23]]} The start node: 2 The destination: To find the shortest path from node 2 to node 20 in the given graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
