It uses a queue to manage the nodes to be explored and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. **Path Recording**: Each time a node is dequeued, its neighbors are enqueued along with the path taken to reach them.

We also maintain a set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes.\n- **Exploration**: We dequeue a node from the front of the queue and check if it is the goal node. If it is, we return the path. Otherwise, we mark it as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors along with the updated path.\n- **Termination**: The loop continues until we either find the goal node or exhaust all possibilities. If we find the goal node, we return the path; otherwise, we return `None` indicating no path exists.\n\nRunning this code will give us the shortest"}]
