BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the starting node (node 2) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors. Mark each neighbor as visited and record the path taken to reach each neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: Continue this process until the destination node (node 3) is dequeued from the queue. The recorded path will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Traversal:\n\n1. **Start with node 2**:\n   - Enqueue 2.\n   - Mark 2 as visited.\n\n2. **Dequeue 2**:\n   - Neighbors of 2 are 4 and 12.\n   - Enqueue 4 and 12.\n   - Mark 4 and 12 as visited.\n\n3. **Dequeue 4**:\n   - Neighbors of 4 are 2 and 12.\n   - Both are already visited, so no new nodes are enqueued.\n\n4. **Dequeue 12**:\n   - Neighbors of 12 are 2 and 3.\n   - Node 2 is already visited, but node 3 is not.\n   - Enqueue 3.\n   - Mark 3 as visited.\n\n5. **Dequeue 3**:\n   - Neighbors of 3 are 10, 12, and 1.\n   - Nodes 10 and 12 are already visited, but node 1 is not.\n   - Enqueue 1.\n   - Mark 1 as visited.\n\n6. **Dequeue 1**:\n   - Neighbors of 1 are 11 and 3.\n   - Both are already visited, so no new nodes are enqueued.\n\n7. **Dequeue 10**:\n   - Neighbors of 10 are 3 and 12.\n   - Both are already visited, so no new nodes are enqueued.\n\n8. **Dequeue 1**:\n   - Neighbors of 1 are 11 and 3.\n   - Both are already visited, so no new nodes are enqueued.\n\n9. **Dequeue 11**:\n   - Neighbors of 11 are 0, 1, and 7.\n   - Nodes 0, 1, and 7 are not yet visited.\n   - Enqueue 0, 1, and 7.\n   - Mark them as visited.\n\n10. **Dequeue 0**:\n    - Neighbors of 0 are 6 and 11.\n    - Both are already visited, so no new nodes are enqueued.\n\n11. **Dequeue 1**:\n    - Neighbors of 1 are 11 and 3.\n    - Both are already visited, so no new nodes are enqueued.\n\n12. **Dequeue 7**:\n    - Neighbors of 7 are 8 and 11.\n    - Both are already visited, so no new nodes are enqueued.\n\n13. **Dequeue 8**:\n    - Neighbors of 8 are 5 and 7.\n    - Both are already visited, so no new nodes are enqueued.\n\n14. **Dequeue 5**:\n    - Neighbors of 5 are 9 and 8.\n    - Both are already visited, so no new nodes are enqueued.\n\n15. **Dequeue 9**:\n    - Neighbors of 9 are 5 and 3.\n    - Both are already visited, so no new nodes are enqueued.\n\nSince we have reached node 3, we stop the search.
