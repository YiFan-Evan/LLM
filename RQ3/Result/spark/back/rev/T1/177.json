BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the starting node (node 16) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors. Mark each neighbor as visited and record the path taken to reach each neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: Continue this process until the destination node (node 18) is dequeued from the queue. The recorded path will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    # Set of visited nodes\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue a node from the front of the queue\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If the current node is the goal, return the path\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Get all adjacent nodes\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n                    visited.add(next_node)\n    \n    return None  # Return None if there is no path from start to goal\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 18], [0, 17], [1, 5], [1, 13], [1, 10], [1, 24], [2, 6], [3, 12], [3, 13], [4, 19], [4, 10], [6, 21], [7, 19], [8, 17], [8, 11], [9, 11], [9, 23], [9, 20], [11, 16], [11, 22], [14, 15], [15, 19], [20, 24], [21, 23]]\n}\n\n# Find the shortest path from node 16 to node 18\nstart_node = 16\ndestination_node = 18\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\n\n# Print the result in the required format\nresult = \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path))\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", result)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the shortest path from node 16 to node 18.
