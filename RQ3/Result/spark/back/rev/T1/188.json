Mark each neighbor as visited and record the path taken to reach each neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: Continue this process until the destination node (7) is dequeued or the queue is empty (indicating that there is no path between the start and destination).\n\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue a vertex from queue\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If the current node is the goal, return the path\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return \"->\".join(map(str, path))\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Get all adjacent nodes of the dequeued node\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n                    visited.add(next_node)\n    \n    return \"No path found\"\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 16], [0, 19], [0, 2], [0, 17], [1, 8], [2, 21], [2, 14], [3, 9], [4, 18], [4, 9], [5, 9], [7, 22], [7, 10], [8, 18], [9, 15], [9, 16], [10, 14], [11, 16], [12, 17], [12, 13], [13, 24], [14, 23], [20, 24]]\n}\n\n# Define the start and goal nodes\nstart_node = 18\ngoal_node = 7\n\n# Find the shortest path using BFS\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, start_node, goal_node)\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", shortest_path)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented with nodes and edges.
