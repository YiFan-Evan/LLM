BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the starting node (node 6) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors. Mark each neighbor as visited and record the path taken to reach each neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: Continue this process until the destination node (node 2) is dequeued from the queue. The recorded path will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [6]\n   - Visited: {6}\n   - Path: {6: [6]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 6**:\n   - Neighbors of 6: [0, 2]\n   - Enqueue 0 and 2 if they are not visited.\n   - Queue: [0, 2]\n   - Visited: {0, 2, 6}\n   - Path: {6: [6], 0: [6, 0], 2: [6, 2]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 0**:\n   - Neighbors of 0: [5, 6, 7]\n   - Enqueue 5, 6, and 7 if they are not visited.\n   - Queue: [2, 5, 6, 7]\n   - Visited: {0, 2, 5, 6, 7}\n   - Path: {6: [6], 0: [6, 0], 2: [6, 2], 5: [6, 0, 5], 6: [6], 7: [6, 0, 7]}\n\n4. **Dequeue 2**:\n   - Neighbors of 2: [1, 6]\n   - Enqueue 1 and 6 if they are not visited.\n   - Queue: [5, 6, 7, 1]\n   - Visited: {0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7}\n   - Path: {6: [6], 0: [6, 0], 2: [6, 2], 5: [6, 0, 5], 6: [6], 7: [6, 0, 7], 1: [6, 2, 1]}\n\n5. **Dequeue 5**:\n   - Neighbors of 5: [3, 4]\n   - Enqueue 3 and 4 if they are not visited.\n   - Queue: [6, 7, 1, 3, 4]\n   - Visited: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}\n   - Path: {6: [6], 0: [6, 0], 2: [6, 2], 5: [6, 0, 5], 6: [6], 7: [6, 0, 7], 1: [6, 2, 1], 3: [6, 0, 5, 3], 4: [6, 0, 5, 4]}\n\n6. **Dequeue 6**:\n   - Node 6 is already visited.
