BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the starting node (node 1) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors. Mark each neighbor as visited and record the path taken to reach each neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: Continue this process until the destination node (node 10) is dequeued from the queue. The recorded path will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [1]\n   - Visited: {1}\n   - Path: {1: [1]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 1**:\n   - Neighbors of 1: [12]\n   - Enqueue 12 if not visited\n   - Queue: [12]\n   - Visited: {1, 12}\n   - Path: {1: [1], 12: [1, 12]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 12**:\n   - Neighbors of 12: [0, 1]\n   - Enqueue 0 if not visited\n   - Enqueue 1 if not visited (already visited)\n   - Queue: [0]\n   - Visited: {0, 1, 12}\n   - Path: {1: [1], 12: [1, 12], 0: [1, 12, 0]}\n\n4. **Dequeue 0**:\n   - Neighbors of 0: [8, 12]\n   - Enqueue 8 if not visited\n   - Enqueue 12 if not visited (already visited)\n   - Queue: [8]\n   - Visited: {0, 1, 12, 8}\n   - Path: {1: [1], 12: [1, 12], 0: [1, 12, 0], 8: [1, 12, 0, 8]}\n\n5. **Dequeue 8**:\n   - Neighbors of 8: [3, 11]\n   - Enqueue 3 if not visited\n   - Enqueue 11 if not visited\n   - Queue: [3, 11]\n   - Visited: {0, 1, 12, 8, 3, 11}\n   - Path: {1: [1], 12: [1, 12], 0: [1, 12, 0], 8: [1, 12, 0, 8], 3: [1, 12, 0, 8, 3], 11: [1, 12, 0, 8, 11]}\n\n6. **Dequeue 3**:\n   - Neighbors of 3: [9, 2]\n   - Enqueue 9 if not visited\n   - Enqueue 2 if not visited\n   - Queue: [11, 9, 2]\n   - Visited: {0, 1, 12, 8, 3, 11, 9, 2}\n   - Path: {1: [1], 12: [1, 12], 0: [1, 12, 0], 8: [1, 12, 0, 8], 3: [1, 12, 0, 8, 3], 11: [1, 12, 0, 8, 11], 9: [1, 12, 0, 8, 3, 9], 2: [1, 12, 0, 8, 3, 2]}\n\n7. **"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 8], [0, 12], [1, 12], [2, 3], [3, 9], [3, 8], [4, 10], [4, 6], [5, 6], [6, 9], [7, 11], [8, 11]]} The start node: 10 The destination: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 10 to node 1 in the given graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Queue: [10]\n   - Visited: {10}\n   - Path: {10: [10]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 10**:\n   - Neighbors of 10: [4, 6]\n   - Enqueue 4 if not visited\n   - Enqueue 6 if not visited\n   - Queue: [4, 6]\n   - Visited: {4, 6, 10}\n   - Path: {10: [10], 4: [10, 4], 6: [10, 6]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 4**:\n   - Neighbors of 4: [10, 12]\n   - Enqueue 12 if not visited\n   - Queue: [6, 12]\n   - Visited: {4, 6, 10, 12}\n   - Path: {10: [10], 4: [10, 4], 6: [10, 6], 12: [10, 4, 12]}\n\n4. **Dequeue 6**:\n   - Neighbors of 6: [4, 5, 9]\n   - Enqueue 5 if not visited\n   - Enqueue 9 if not visited\n   - Queue: [12, 5, 9]\n   - Visited: {4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12}\n   - Path: {10: [10], 4: [10, 4], 6: [10, 6], 12: [10, 4, 12], 5: [10, 6, 5], 9: [10, 6, 9]}\n\n5. **Dequeue 12**:\n   - Neighbors of 12: [0, 1]\n   - Enqueue 0 if not visited\n   - Enqueue 1 if not visited\n   - Queue: [5, 9, 0, 1]\n   - Visited: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12}\n   - Path: {10: [10], 4: [10, 4], 6: [10, 6], 12: [10, 4, 12], 5: [10, 6, 5], 9: [10, 6, 9], 0: [10, 4, 12, 0], 1: [10, 4, 12, 1]}\n\n6. **Dequeue 5**:\n   - Neighbors of 5: [6]\n   - Enqueue 6 if not visited (already visited)\n   - Queue: [9, 0, 1]\n   - Visited: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12}\n   - Path remains unchanged as no new paths are found through node 5.\n\n7. **Dequeue 9**:\n   - Neighbors of 9: [6]\n   - Enqueue 6 if not visited (already visited)\n   - Queue: [0, 1]\n   - Visited: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12}\n   - Path remains unchanged as no new paths are found through node 9.\n\n8. **Dequeue 0**:\n   - Neighbors of 0: [8, 12]\n   - Enqueue 8 if not visited\n   - Enqueue 12 if not visited (already visited)\n   - Queue: [1, 8]\n   - Visited: {0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12}\n   - Path: {10: [10], 4: [10,"}]
