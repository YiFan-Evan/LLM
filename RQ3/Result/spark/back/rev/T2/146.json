BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the starting node (node 4) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors. Mark each neighbor as visited and record the path taken to reach each neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: Continue this process until the destination node (node 10) is dequeued from the queue. The recorded path will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [4]\n   - Visited: {4}\n   - Path: {4: [4]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 4**:\n   - Neighbors of 4: [9, 6]\n   - Enqueue 9 and 6 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [9, 6]\n   - Visited: {4, 9, 6}\n   - Path: {4: [4], 9: [4, 9], 6: [4, 6]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 9**:\n   - Neighbors of 9: [11, 13]\n   - Enqueue 11 and 13 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [6, 11, 13]\n   - Visited: {4, 9, 6, 11, 13}\n   - Path: {4: [4], 9: [4, 9], 6: [4, 6], 11: [4, 9, 11], 13: [4, 9, 13]}\n\n4. **Dequeue 6**:\n   - Neighbors of 6: [12, 14]\n   - Enqueue 12 and 14 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [11, 13, 12, 14]\n   - Visited: {4, 9, 6, 11, 13, 12, 14}\n   - Path: {4: [4], 9: [4, 9], 6: [4, 6], 11: [4, 9, 11], 13: [4, 9, 13], 12: [4, 6, 12], 14: [4, 6, 14]}\n\n5. **Dequeue 11**:\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue since 11 has no outgoing edges.\n   - Queue: [13, 12, 14]\n   - Visited: {4, 9, 6, 11, 13, 12, 14}\n   - Path remains unchanged.\n\n6. **Dequeue 13**:\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue since 13 has no outgoing edges.\n   - Queue: [12, 14]\n   - Visited: {4, 9, 6, 11, 13, 12, 14}\n   - Path remains unchanged.\n\n7. **Dequeue 12**:\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue since 12 has no outgoing edges.\n   - Queue: [14]\n   - Visited: {4, 9, 6, 11, 13, 12, 14}\n   - Path remains unchanged.\n\n8. **Dequeue 14**:\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue since 14 has no outgoing edges.\n   - Queue: []\n   - Visited: {4, 9, 6, 11, 13, 12, 14}\n   - Path"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 8], [0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 10], [4, 9], [4, 6], [5, 14], [6, 12], [6, 14], [7, 8], [8, 10], [9, 11], [9, 13]]} The start node: 10 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 10 to node 4 in the given graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Queue: [10]\n   - Visited: {10}\n   - Path: {10: [10]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 10**:\n   - Neighbors of 10: [8, 1]\n   - Enqueue 8 and 1 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [8, 1]\n   - Visited: {10, 8, 1}\n   - Path: {10: [10], 8: [10, 8], 1: [10, 1]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 8**:\n   - Neighbors of 8: [7, 0, 10]\n   - Enqueue 7, 0, and 10 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [1, 7, 0, 10]\n   - Visited: {10, 8, 1, 7, 0, 10}\n   - Path: {10: [10], 8: [10, 8], 1: [10, 1], 7: [10, 8, 7], 0: [10, 8, 0], 10: [10, 8, 10]}\n\n4. **Dequeue 1**:\n   - Neighbors of 1: [3, 10]\n   - Enqueue 3 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [7, 0, 10, 3]\n   - Visited: {10, 8, 1, 7, 0, 10, 3}\n   - Path: {10: [10], 8: [10, 8], 1: [10, 1], 7: [10, 8, 7], 0: [10, 8, 0], 10: [10, 8, 10], 3: [10, 1, 3]}\n\n5. **Dequeue 7**:\n   - Neighbors of 7: [8]\n   - Enqueue 8 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [0, 10, 3, 8]\n   - Visited: {10, 8, 1, 7, 0, 10, 3}\n   - Path remains unchanged.\n\n6. **Dequeue 0**:\n   - Neighbors of 0: [2, 8, 6]\n   - Enqueue 2, 8, and 6 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [10, 3, 8, 2, 8, 6]\n   - Visited: {10, 8, 1, 7, 0, 10, 3, 2, 6}\n   - Path: {10: [10], 8: [10, 8], 1: [10, 1], 7: [10, 8, 7], 0: [10, 8, 0], 10: [10, 8, 10], 3: [10, 1, 3], 2: [10, 1, 3, 2], 6: [10, 8, 0, 6]}\n\n7. **Dequeue 3**:\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue since 3 has no outgoing edges.\n   - Queue: [10, 8, 2, 8, 6]\n   - Visited: {10, 8, 1, 7, 0, 10, 3, 2, 6}\n   - Path remains unchanged.\n\n8. **Dequeue 8**:\n   - No new neighbors to enqueue since 8 has already been visited.\n   - Queue: [10, 2, 8, 6]\n   - Visited: {10, 8, 1, 7, 0, 1"}]
