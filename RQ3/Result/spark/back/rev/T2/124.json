BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the starting node (node 4) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors. Mark each neighbor as visited and record the path taken to reach each neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: Continue this process until the destination node (node 1) is dequeued from the queue. The recorded path will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [4]\n   - Visited: {4}\n   - Path: {4: [4]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 4**:\n   - Neighbors of 4: [1, 6]\n   - Enqueue 1 and 6 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [1, 6]\n   - Visited: {1, 4, 6}\n   - Path: {4: [4], 1: [4, 1], 6: [4, 6]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 1**:\n   - Neighbors of 1: [2, 4, 6, 11, 12]\n   - Enqueue 2, 6, 11, and 12 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [6, 2, 11, 12]\n   - Visited: {1, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12}\n   - Path: {4: [4], 1: [4, 1], 6: [4, 6], 2: [4, 1, 2], 11: [4, 1, 11], 12: [4, 1, 12]}\n\n4. **Dequeue 6**:\n   - Neighbors of 6: [3]\n   - Enqueue 3 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [2, 11, 12, 3]\n   - Visited: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12}\n   - Path: {4: [4], 1: [4, 1], 6: [4, 6], 2: [4, 1, 2], 11: [4, 1, 11], 12: [4, 1, 12], 3: [4, 6, 3]}\n\n5. **Dequeue 2**:\n   - Neighbors of 2: []\n   - No new nodes to enqueue.\n   - Queue: [11, 12, 3]\n   - Visited: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 12}\n   - Path remains unchanged.\n\n6. **Dequeue 11**:\n   - Neighbors of 11: [9]\n   - Enqueue 9 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [12, 3, 9]\n   - Visited: {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 12}\n   - Path: {4: [4], 1: [4, 1], 6: [4, 6], 2: [4, 1, 2], 11: [4, 1, 11], 12: [4, 1, 12], 3: [4, 6, 3], 9: [4, 1, 11, 9]}\n\n7. **Dequeue 12**:\n   - Neighbors of 12: [13, 14]\n   - Enqueue 13 and"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 8], [0, 10], [0, 9], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 6], [1, 11], [1, 12], [3, 6], [5, 7], [7, 8], [9, 11], [12, 13], [12, 14]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4 in the given graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS), we can follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Queue: [1]\n   - Visited: {1}\n   - Path: {1: [1]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 1**:\n   - Neighbors of 1: [2, 4, 6, 11, 12]\n   - Enqueue 2, 4, 6, 11, and 12 if not visited.\n   - Queue: [2, 4, 6, 11, 12]\n   - Visited: {1, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12}\n   - Path: {1: [1], 2: [1, 2], 4: [1, 4], 6: [1, 6], 11: [1, 11], 12: [1, 12]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 2**:\n   - Neighbors of 2: []\n   - No new nodes to enqueue.\n   - Queue: [4, 6, 11, 12]\n   - Visited: {1, 2, 4, 6, 11, 12}\n   - Path remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Dequeue 4**:\n   - Node 4 is the destination node.\n   - The shortest path is found.\n   - Path: {1: [1], 2: [1, 2], 4: [1, 4], 6: [1, 6], 11: [1, 11], 12: [1, 12]}\n\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 4 is:\n\n```plaintext\n1->4\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```plaintext\n1->4\n```"}]
