BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the starting node (node 7) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors. Mark each neighbor as visited and record the path taken to reach each neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: Continue this process until the destination node (node 12) is dequeued from the queue. The recorded path will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialize**:\n   - Queue: [7]\n   - Visited: {7}\n   - Path: {7: [7]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 7**:\n   - Neighbors of 7: [0, 3, 6]\n   - Enqueue unvisited neighbors: [0, 3, 6]\n   - Update visited: {0, 3, 6, 7}\n   - Update path: {7: [7], 0: [7, 0], 3: [7, 3], 6: [7, 6]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 0**:\n   - Neighbors of 0: [1, 2, 14]\n   - Enqueue unvisited neighbors: [1, 2, 14]\n   - Update visited: {0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14}\n   - Update path: {7: [7], 0: [7, 0], 3: [7, 3], 6: [7, 6], 1: [7, 0, 1], 2: [7, 0, 2], 14: [7, 0, 14]}\n\n4. **Dequeue 3**:\n   - Neighbors of 3: [7, 0, 2] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n5. **Dequeue 6**:\n   - Neighbors of 6: [5, 13, 7] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n6. **Dequeue 1**:\n   - Neighbors of 1: [0] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n7. **Dequeue 2**:\n   - Neighbors of 2: [0, 3, 7] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n8. **Dequeue 14**:\n   - Neighbors of 14: [0, 8] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n9. **Dequeue 5**:\n   - Neighbors of 5: [12, 13, 6] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n10. **Dequeue 13**:\n    - Neighbors of 13: [4, 6] (already visited)\n    - No new nodes to enqueue\n    - Update path remains unchanged\n\n11. **Dequeue 12**:\n    - Neighbors of 12: [5, 9, 11] (already visited)\n    - No new nodes to enqueue\n    - Update path remains unchanged\n\n12. **Dequeue 9**:\n    - Neighbors of 9: [8, 12] (already visited)\n    - No new nodes to enqueue\n    - Update path remains unchanged\n\n13. **Dequeue 11**:\n    - Neighbors of 11: "}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 14], [2, 3], [3, 7], [4, 13], [5, 12], [5, 6], [6, 13], [6, 7], [8, 10], [8, 14], [9, 12], [11, 12]]} The start node: 12 The destination: 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 12 to node 7 in the given graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS), we follow these steps:\n\n### Step-by-Step BFS Execution:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Queue: [12]\n   - Visited: {12}\n   - Path: {12: [12]}\n\n2. **Dequeue 12**:\n   - Neighbors of 12: [5, 9, 11]\n   - Enqueue unvisited neighbors: [5, 9, 11]\n   - Update visited: {5, 9, 11, 12}\n   - Update path: {12: [12], 5: [12, 5], 9: [12, 9], 11: [12, 11]}\n\n3. **Dequeue 5**:\n   - Neighbors of 5: [12, 6]\n   - Enqueue unvisited neighbor: [6]\n   - Update visited: {5, 6, 9, 11, 12}\n   - Update path: {12: [12], 5: [12, 5], 9: [12, 9], 11: [12, 11], 6: [12, 5, 6]}\n\n4. **Dequeue 9**:\n   - Neighbors of 9: [8, 12] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n5. **Dequeue 11**:\n   - Neighbors of 11: [9, 12] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n6. **Dequeue 6**:\n   - Neighbors of 6: [5, 12, 13]\n   - Enqueue unvisited neighbors: [13]\n   - Update visited: {5, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13}\n   - Update path: {12: [12], 5: [12, 5], 9: [12, 9], 11: [12, 11], 6: [12, 5, 6], 13: [12, 5, 6, 13]}\n\n7. **Dequeue 13**:\n   - Neighbors of 13: [4, 6] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n8. **Dequeue 4**:\n   - Neighbors of 4: [13] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n9. **Dequeue 8**:\n   - Neighbors of 8: [10, 14] (already visited)\n   - No new nodes to enqueue\n   - Update path remains unchanged\n\n10. **Dequeue 10**:\n    - Neighbors of 10: [8] (already visited)\n    - No new nodes to enqueue\n    - Update path remains unchanged\n\n11. **Dequeue 14**:\n    - Neighbors of 14: [0, 8] (already visited)\n    - No new nodes to enqueue\n    - Update path remains unchanged\n\n12. **Dequeue 0**:\n    - Neighbors of 0: [1, 2, 14] (already visited)\n    - No new nodes to enqueue\n    - Update path remains unchanged\n\n13. **Dequeue 1**:\n    - Neighbors of 1: [0] (already visited)\n    - No new nodes to enqueue\n    - Update path remains unchanged\n\n14. **Dequeue 2**:\n    - Neighbors of 2: [0, 3, 7]\n    - Enqueue unvisited neighbors: [3, 7]\n    - Update visited: {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12"}]
