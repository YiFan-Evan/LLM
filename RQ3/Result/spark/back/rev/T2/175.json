BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores all neighbors at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the starting node (node 1) into a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. **Exploration**: Dequeue a node from the front of the queue, and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors. Mark each neighbor as visited and record the path taken to reach each neighbor.\n3. **Termination**: Continue this process until the destination node (node 10) is dequeued from the queue. The recorded path will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, goal):\n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([(start, [start])])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Dequeue a vertex from queue\n        current_node, path = queue.popleft()\n        \n        # If the current node is the goal, return the path\n        if current_node == goal:\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark the current node as visited\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        \n        # Get all adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex current_node\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if current_node in neighbor:\n                next_node = neighbor[1] if neighbor[0] == current_node else neighbor[0]\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    queue.append((next_node, path + [next_node]))\n                    visited.add(next_node)\n    \n    return None  # Return None if there is no path between start and goal\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 14], [0, 15], [1, 9], [2, 7], [3, 23], [5, 15], [5, 12], [6, 10], [6, 12], [6, 24], [7, 18], [7, 23], [7, 15], [8, 10], [9, 17], [9, 20], [9, 24], [11, 12], [13, 23], [14, 16], [16, 22], [19, 24], [21, 22]]\n}\n\n# Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 10\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 1, 10)\nprint(\"The shortest path is:\", \"->\".join(map(str, shortest_path)))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented using a dictionary with 'nodes' and 'edges'.\n2. **BFS Function**: The `bfs_shortest_path` function performs BFS to find the shortest path.
