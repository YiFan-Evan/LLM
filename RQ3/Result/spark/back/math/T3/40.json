We will integrate each term separately and then add the results.\n\n#### Integration of $ e^{\\cos(x)} $\nAs mentioned earlier, $ e^{\\cos(x)} $ does not have an elementary antiderivative. Therefore, we leave it as is in the integral form:\n$$ \\int e^{\\cos(x)} \\, dx $$\n\n#### Integration of $ x $\nThe integral of $ x $ is straightforward:\n$$ \\int x \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C_2 $$\nwhere $ C_2 $ is the constant of integration.\n\nCombining both, the indefinite integral of $ e^{\\cos(x)} + x $ is:\n$$ \\int (e^{\\cos(x)} + x) \\, dx = \\int e^{\\cos(x)} \\, dx + \\int x \\, dx = \\int e^{\\cos(x)} \\, dx + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C $$\nwhere $ C $ is the combined constant of integration.\n\n### Step 2: Substitute $ x = 4 $\n\nSubstituting $ x = 4 $ into the expression:\n$$ \\int e^{\\cos(x)} \\, dx + \\frac{x^2}{2} $$\nat $ x = 4 $ gives:\n$$ \\int e^{\\cos(4)} \\, dx + \\frac{4^2}{2} $$\nSince $ \\int e^{\\cos(x)} \\, dx $ cannot be evaluated in terms of elementary functions, we leave it as is.
