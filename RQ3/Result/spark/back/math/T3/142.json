Therefore, we can only express its integral as:\n\\[\n\\int \\sin(\\sinh(x)) \\, dx = F(x) + C_2\n\\]\nwhere \\( F(x) \\) is some function representing the integral and \\( C_2 \\) is another constant of integration.\n\nCombining both parts, the indefinite integral becomes:\n\\[\n\\int (\\sin(\\sinh(x)) + x) \\, dx = F(x) + \\frac{x^2}{2} + C\n\\]\nwhere \\( C \\) is the overall constant of integration.\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 4 \\)\n\nSubstituting \\( x = 4 \\) into the result of the indefinite integral, we get:\n\\[\nF(4) + \\frac{4^2}{2} + C\n\\]\nSimplifying this gives:\n\\[\nF(4) + 8 + C\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Round Down to the Nearest Integer\n\nSince we do not have an explicit form for \\( F(x) \\), we cannot evaluate \\( F(4) \\) exactly. However, if we assume that \\( F(x) \\) is a continuous function, then \\( F(4) \\) will be some real number. To round down to the nearest integer, we consider only the integer part of the expression:\n\\[\n\\lfloor F(4) + 8 + C \\rfloor\n\\]\n\nSince \\( F(4) \\) and \\( C \\) are real numbers, their sum added to 8 will still be a real number. Therefore, the integer part of this expression is simply the integer part of 8, which is 8.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]"}]
