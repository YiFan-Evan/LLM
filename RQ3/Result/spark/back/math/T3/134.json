To find its indefinite integral, we use substitution and special functions. The integral of \\( e^{\\sin(x)} \\) does not have a simple closed form in terms of elementary functions, but it can be expressed using a special function known as the exponential integral or simply left in its integral form for practical purposes.\n\nHowever, for this problem, we will denote the indefinite integral as:\n\\[\n\\int e^{\\sin(x)} \\, dx\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 4 \\)\n\nSince we cannot directly compute the indefinite integral in elementary terms, we will consider the definite integral from some constant \\( a \\) to \\( x \\):\n\\[\n\\int_a^x e^{\\sin(t)} \\, dt\n\\]\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume \\( a = 0 \\).
