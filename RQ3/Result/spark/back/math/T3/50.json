Let:\n\\[ u = e^x \\]\nThen, the derivative of \\( u \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is:\n\\[ du = e^x dx \\]\nor equivalently:\n\\[ dx = \\frac{du}{e^x} = \\frac{du}{u} \\]\n\nNow, rewrite the integral in terms of \\( u \\):\n\\[ \\int e^{e^x} dx = \\int e^u \\cdot \\frac{du}{u} \\]\n\nThis integral does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, for the purpose of this problem, we will consider the general form and proceed to evaluate it at the specific point \\( x = 4 \\).\n\n### Step 2: Substitute \\( x = 4 \\)\n\nWe need to evaluate the expression at \\( x = 4 \\).

For practical purposes, we would typically use numerical methods or software to approximate this integral.\n\n### Step 3: Round Down to the Nearest Integer\n\nGiven that we cannot compute the exact value of the integral analytically, we would typically use numerical integration techniques (like Simpson's rule, trapezoidal rule, or numerical integration tools) to approximate the value of the integral from \\( a \\) to 4.\n\nFor the sake of this exercise, let's assume we have access to such numerical methods and obtain an approximate value.
