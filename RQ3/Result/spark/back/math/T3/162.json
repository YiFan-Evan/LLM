To find its indefinite integral, we denote it as:\n\n\\[\nI = \\int \\left( \\frac{e^x}{x} \\sin(x) + x \\right) \\, dx\n\\]\n\nWe can break this integral into two parts:\n\n\\[\nI = \\int \\frac{e^x}{x} \\sin(x) \\, dx + \\int x \\, dx\n\\]\n\nFor the first part, \\( \\int \\frac{e^x}{x} \\sin(x) \\, dx \\), this integral does not have a straightforward antiderivative in terms of elementary functions and typically requires special functions or numerical methods for evaluation.
