Theatre. Theatre is a common place for live entertainment, which includes plays, musicals, variety shows, and other live performances. Movies are also a form of entertainment, but they are usually watched at home or in a cinema rather than in a dedicated venue. Concert venues are often used for live music performances, but they are not typically considered live entertainment in the same way as a theatre. Casino is a place for gambling and not for entertainment. Therefore, the correct answer is E.
