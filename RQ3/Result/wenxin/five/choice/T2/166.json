Gas stations typically have maps, road signs, and other useful information that can help travelers navigate their way around the area. Truck stops and amusement parks are not necessarily the best places to find a map because they may not have a wide variety of maps or information about local roads and routes. Atlas is a book that contains maps of different regions and is not relevant to the question. Malls are shopping centers and not necessarily equipped with maps or road information.
