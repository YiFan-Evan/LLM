This is because Christians believe that if someone is spiritually reborn, they are saved and will go to heaven when they die. This belief is central to the Christian doctrine of conversion or \"rebirth.\" The other options are not consistent with Christian beliefs about the afterlife. A person who is unable to work, for example, may not be considered a candidate for heaven. Similarly, changing color or ceasing to exist are not relevant to the Christian concept of heaven.
