When you see something rise, it means that you are located below it, relative to its position. This is because objects in the sky rise above our heads and appear to be moving upwards. Therefore, you are located below the object when you see it rise. The other options are incorrect because they do not describe the correct relationship between the observer and the object. For example, the sun sets in the west, not rises above it. Similarly, falling objects do not rise above you. Therefore, the correct answer is D.
