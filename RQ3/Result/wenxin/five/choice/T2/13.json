Having sexual intercourse with your spouse and going to bed typically means the couple are going to have intercourse regularly. If the couple decides to conceive a child, they will most likely be in the best physical condition to become pregnant at that time.

This statement does not explain the outcome of sexual intercourse and is a red herring. Going to bed typically means that the couple is going to sleep, which is a physical act that can lead to rest, relaxation, and possibly a good nights sleep. However, it does not directly imply that going to bed for sex would lead to sleepiness. Therefore, the answer is C. rest.\n\nFor reference, options A, B, and E are unrelated to the question and have been omitted."}]
