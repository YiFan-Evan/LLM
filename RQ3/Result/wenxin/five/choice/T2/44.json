Nest. Birds typically make their homes in nests, which are usually found in trees or other suitable locations. Forests and leaves are not suitable for nesting, and birds do not typically nest in the sky. Roofs are also not ideal locations for nesting because they are usually out of the bird's sight line and often covered by human-made objects that could pose a danger to the bird.
