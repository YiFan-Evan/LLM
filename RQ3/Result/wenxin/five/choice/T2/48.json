Union.\n\nTo go off strike, the unions need to make reasonable demands, such as better working conditions, better wages and benefits, etc. However, it is not reasonable to ask for more money or not to go to work as these are unreasonable demands that may lead to the union going back to strike again. On the other hand, return to work is an appropriate request to solve the problem in the short term. The answer E is union, which suggests that unions should take reasonable steps to improve the working conditions of workers, promote dialogue with management and resolve issues as a collective responsibility, and also actively communicate with their members and others to achieve positive results."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What type of demands to the unions need to be making to go off strike?\nOptions: A. union B. return to work C. not go to work D. more money E. reasonable"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correct answer is E. Reasonable.\n\nUnions need to make reasonable demands to go off strike, which means that they should not ask for unreasonable or excessive demands that may lead to the union going back to strike again. Therefore, the answer E, reasonable, is the correct option.\n\nThe other options are not correct because they are either unreasonable or not related to the question. For example, \"union\" is not a demand, but a type of organization that represents workers. \"Return to work\" is not a demand, but a request to solve the problem in the short term. \"Not go to work\" is also not a demand, but a statement of opposition to work. \"More money\" is an excessive demand that may lead to disputes and conflicts between management and workers."}]
