Cling film. Cling film is commonly used to wrap items to prevent them from drying out, and it can be applied to a pen to prevent it from drying out. Ink in a pen is not enough to prevent it from drying out and it also might damage the pen if not applied properly. Ink cartridges are not a direct answer and should be considered as part of another question. Caps are used to cover the pen tip, not to prevent it from drying out.
