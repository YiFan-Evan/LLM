Firstly, if they do not bathe, they may become dirty and develop infections or rashes on their skin. Secondly, bathing can help to maintain hygiene and cleanliness, which is essential for maintaining good health. Finally, bathing can also help to alleviate stress and anxiety, which can be beneficial for overall well-being. Therefore, the answer is E. Rash.\n\nOption A, flooding, does not have any relevance to the question about bathing people with a fear of water or dislike of being wet.\n\nOptions B and D, drowning and getting wet, are also incorrect because it is important to ensure that they do not drown or become excessively wet during bathing.\n\nOption C, wet skin, is relevant because it explains the importance of bathing for maintaining good hygiene and cleanliness of the skin, despite having a fear of water or dislike of being wet.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E.
