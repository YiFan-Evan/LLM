Saliva is a clear liquid produced by the salivary glands that moistens the mouth and helps in digestion. When saliva accumulates excessively in the mouth without being properly exhaled, it may lead to the production of spittle. Phlegm, on the other hand, is a clear, mucus-like substance produced by the respiratory tract that serves a protective function. Disease and germs refer to conditions or microorganisms that can affect the body, not the production of saliva or spittle.
