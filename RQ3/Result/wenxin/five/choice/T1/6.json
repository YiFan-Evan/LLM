Indiana\". The sentence \"They passed a apple tree on their way to the racetrack\" indicates that they were heading towards a racetrack, and the \"biggest motorsport spectacle in the world\" must be a big race at a racetrack, which would only be held in certain places, like Indianapolis. Therefore, the correct answer is \"B. Indiana\". The other options like Maryland, park, and New Jersey are not racetracks and do not host big motorsport events.
