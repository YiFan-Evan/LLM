High schools typically have a larger student population and more funding, which allows them to provide a wider variety of food options and better service. A canteen may also have a good food service, but it is usually limited to serving students in a specific institution or organization. Polytechnics typically serve students in vocational or technical courses, and their cafeterias may not have the same variety of food options as a high school cafeteria. A large room or all kinds of schools may not have a dedicated cafeteria or may have limited food service options.
