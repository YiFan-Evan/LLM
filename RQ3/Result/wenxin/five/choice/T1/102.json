Parents typically encourage children to go out and play on the weekends to allow them to have fun, socialize with friends, and engage in physical activities. This is in contrast to studying, which is typically a more structured activity that takes place during school days, and cleaning the room, which is usually done during regular weekday hours. Rowing a boat is also a specific activity that is not typically done on weekends. Therefore, the answer to the question is C.
