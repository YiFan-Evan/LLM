Pockets are small compartments or pockets on a person's clothing that can be used to store small items such as books while traveling. Libraries, backpacks, and suitcases are also suitable for storing books, but they are generally designed for larger items or for carrying belongings. Synagogues do not have any designated storage space for books, as they are primarily used for religious services and community gatherings.
