They are designed for traffic to flow freely and efficiently, and cars usually travel at very high speeds on them. Roads are also used for high-speed travel, but they are not typically designed for it and can become dangerous when traffic is heavy or roads are narrow. Race tracks are designed specifically for high-speed car racing, and alleys and parking lots are not suitable for high-speed travel.
