When you first meet a child, you typically ask her to dress herself, as it is a natural way to engage with a child. This helps establish a connection and makes the child feel more comfortable. The other options are not relevant or appropriate for first meeting a child. Asking questions, counting to ten, and stating name are all things you can do with a child after you have established a connection and trust, but not at the initial meeting.
