If you designed a place for an annoying critter to stay, you would build a cat condo. This is because a cat condo would be a suitable habitat for cats, and it would be designed to provide them with comfort and safety. The other options are not suitable answers because they do not represent a suitable habitat for the critter in question. Swamp, for example, is not a suitable habitat for most critters, and spreading disease would be unethical and illegal. Bug campers is not a building type, and fly away would not provide the critter with any comfort or safety. Therefore, the best answer is D.
