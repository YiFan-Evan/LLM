Cling film is commonly used to wrap and prevent items from drying out, and it would be suitable for protecting a pen from evaporation of moisture. Inks are used inside the pen, but not on the pen itself. Ink cartridges are used to refill the ink inside the pen, but they are not directly applied to the pen itself. Caps are used to cover the pen's nib, not to prevent the pen from drying out.
