Additionally, the keywords \"loneliness\" and \"going_out_at_night\" imply that the friends may be seeking emotional support or wanting to socialize. Therefore, the model\\'s predicted choice of \"calling each other\" aligns with the idea that friends may communicate through technology to provide emotional support or make plans to meet up in person.)\\nOptions: A. call each other B. group together C. understand each other D. meet for lunch E. part company'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'B'}], 3.
