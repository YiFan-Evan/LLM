Therefore, the model\\'s predicted choice of \"calling each other\" aligns with the idea that friends may communicate through technology to provide emotional support or make plans to meet up in person.)\\nOptions: A. call each other B. group together C. understand each other D. meet for lunch E. part company'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'B'}], 3.

Garments. Silk is a fine, delicate material that is commonly used in clothing and other textiles. If you wanted to show off silk, it would be natural to display items made of silk, such as clothing.
