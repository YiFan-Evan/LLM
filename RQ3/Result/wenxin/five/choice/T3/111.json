Therefore, the model\\'s predicted choice of \"calling each other\" aligns with the idea that friends may communicate through technology to provide emotional support or make plans to meet up in person.)\\nOptions: A. call each other B. group together C. understand each other D. meet for lunch E. part company'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'B'}], 3.
