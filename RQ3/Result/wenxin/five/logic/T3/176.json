Sally is a wumpus, so she must be an impus.\n\n(3) Every jompus is a wumpus. Sally is a jompus, so she must be a wumpus.\n\n(4) Vumpuses are impuses. Sally is a vumpus, which is a type of wumpus, so she must be an impus.\n\n(5) Lorpuses are sterpuses. Sally is a lorpus, which is a type of sterpus, so she must be a sterpus.\n\n(6) Every impus is a shumpus, tumpus, and jompus. Since Sally is an impus, she must also be a shumpus, tumpus, and jompus.\n\n(7) Each dumpus is a wumpus. Sally is a dumpus, which is a type of wumpus, so she must be a wumpus. Since Sally has already been shown to be a wumpus (Sally \u2261 wumpus), it follows that she is also a lempus (as mentioned in the premises).\n\nNow, let's check whether Sally is also a tumpus or grimpus:\n\n(8) Vumpuses are sterpuses. Vampuses are one type of sterpuses; therefore, they belong to the same class as sterpuses.\n\n(9) Each shumpus is a rompus. Since Sally is a shumpus, she must also be a rompus.\n\n(10) Each tumpus is either a lempus or a grimpus. Sally is also a tumpus, so she must be either a lempus or grimpus. Since we already know that Sally is a lempus (as mentioned in the previous step), it follows that Sally is also a tumpus and grimpus.\n\nTherefore, Sally is a lempus, tumpus, or grimpus.
