[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)/sin(x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x)/sin(x) is ln(x) * cos(x) - x * sin(x). Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get ln(4) * cos(4) - 4 * sin(4) = 1.3777. The final integer result is 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)/sin(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x)/sin(x) + x is ln(x) * cos(x) + x * sin(x) + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get ln(4) * cos(4) + 4 * sin(4) + C, which can take any value since C is not fixed. To find the value of C, we need to know the value of the constant. Can you provide the value of the constant?"}]
