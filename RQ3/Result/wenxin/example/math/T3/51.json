[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: cos(x)/(1/x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function cos(x)/(1/x) is: ln|x| + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get: ln4 + C.\n\nTo get the integer result, we need to evaluate the constant C. However, the value of C depends on the method used to calculate the indefinite integral and the value of the integration limit. Therefore, I cannot provide a specific integer result without more information about the method and integration limit used."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: cos(x)/(1/x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function cos(x)/(1/x)+x is: ln|x| + x + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get: ln4 + 4 + C.\n\nTo get the integer result, we need to evaluate the constant C. The value of C depends on the method used to calculate the indefinite integral and the value of the integration limit. Typically, this will be done using a numerical integration method, such as Simpson's rule or the trapezoidal rule. These methods involve approximating the integral using a finite number of intervals and then calculating an average value. If you provide more information about the method and integration limit used, I can provide a more accurate integer result."}]
