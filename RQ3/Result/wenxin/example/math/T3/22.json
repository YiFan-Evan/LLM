[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we get (e^4 + 4) + C = e^4 + 4 + C. Let's calculate the constant C. The constant C = 4 + (e^4). We can approximate e^4 using a simple geometric series formula, which is e^4 = (1 - 1/4)^4 \u2248 0.783695228163551, so the final result is approximately 4 + 0.783695228163551 = 5.783695228163551 rounded down."}]
