[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral gives 1 + 4 + C. To find the integer result, we need to know the value of C. If C is 0, then the final expression is 5. If C is not 0, then the final expression will be different."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of (1+x)+x is 2x + C, where C is a constant.
