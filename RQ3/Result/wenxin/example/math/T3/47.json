[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result, we get the expression e^4 + 4*ln(4) + c. To find the integer result, we need to evaluate the expression. The result is 32 + 4.530307593742264.
