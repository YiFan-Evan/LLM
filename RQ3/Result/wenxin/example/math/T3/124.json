[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sin(x)^2."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of sin(x)^2 is (sin(x))^2 + C, where C is a constant.

To find the final result, we need to know the value of C.\n\nSince the expression includes the square root of a number, we need to know the sign of sin(4) to determine the final result. sin(4) can have both signs depending on the value of 4. If 4 is in the first half of the interval [0, 90], then sin(4) will be positive, and the indefinite integral will be (sin(4))^2 + C > 0.

Subtracting C from (-1)^2 will give us -1 + C.
