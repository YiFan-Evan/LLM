[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)*sin(x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x) * sin(x) is ln(x) * cos(x) - x * sin(x). Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get ln(4) * cos(4) - 4 * sin(4) = 1.5679733779537796.\n\nTherefore, the final integer result is 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)*sin(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x) * sin(x) + x is ln(x) * cos(x) + x * sin(x) + C. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get ln(4) * cos(4) + 4 * sin(4) + C. However, the constant C cannot be determined from the given information. To find the value of C, you would need to evaluate the indefinite integral again with a different constant. If you know the value of C, you can plug it back into the expression and get the final result."}]
