[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result, we get e^4^2 + C = e^64 + C. The final result is an infinite sum of e raised to a large power, which is an infinite series that cannot be calculated exactly. However, if we approximate the result by truncating the series at a finite number of terms, we can get a more accurate result. Assuming that we truncate the series at the first 10 terms, the approximation is approximately equal to e^64 + 1.44. Rounding down to the integer result, we get 15.\n\nTherefore, the integer result of the expression after substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral of e^(x^2) is 15."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x^2+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^(x^2)+x is \u222b(e^(x^2)+x) dx = e^(x^2) + x + C, where C is a constant.
