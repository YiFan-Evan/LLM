[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x) is 1/x. Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get 1/4. This result is an integer, which is equal to 0 rounded down."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x)+x is x+1/x. Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get 4+1/4, which is equal to 4 rounded down."}]
