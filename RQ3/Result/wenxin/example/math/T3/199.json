[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

However, if you want to use a calculator, you can use the built-in functions of the calculator to calculate indefinite integrals.\n\nAssuming that you use a calculator with a symbolic input mode, you can use the following steps:\n\n1. Press the \"Symbolic\" button on the calculator.\n2. Enter the expression sinh(x)^2 * ln(x) and press the \"Enter\" button.\n3. The calculator will evaluate the indefinite integral and display the result.\n\nIf you want to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, you can use the calculator's variable substitution feature and enter x=4. Then press \"Enter\" and the calculator will evaluate the result of the indefinite integral at x=4.\n\nThe final result should be an integer representing the indefinite integral evaluated at x=4 rounded down. However, because I cannot know how your calculator displays its output, I cannot provide a specific number for you.
