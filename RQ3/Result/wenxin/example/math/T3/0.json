[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result gives e^4 + C. To find the integer result, we need to know the value of C. Without that information, we can only approximate the result by taking the natural logarithm of e^4 and rounding down the result.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result gives e^4 + 4 + C. To find the integer result, we need to know the value of C. Without that information, we can only approximate the result by adding 4 to the indefinite integral of e^x+x.
