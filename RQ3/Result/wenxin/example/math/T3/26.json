[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^x is ln(e^x) + C, where C is a constant. Substituting x = 4, we get ln(e^4) + C. To find the final result, we need to know the value of C. Unfortunately, you have not provided that information. If you know the value of C, please let me know and I will calculate the final result for you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^x + x is e^x + x + C, where C is a constant. Substituting x = 4, we get e^4 + 4 + C. To find the final result, we need to know the value of C. Based on your request, I will assume that C = 6 in this example, but please confirm if this is correct. Therefore, the final result for x = 4 is (e^4 + 4) + 6 = e^4 + 10. Note that this result is an integer rounded down, so the final result is 10."}]
