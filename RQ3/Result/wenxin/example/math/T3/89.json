[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sin(x)/sin(x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function sin(x)/sin(x) is:\n\n\u222bsin(x)/sin(x)dx = \u222b1/sin(x)dx\n\nThe indefinite integral of sin(x) is ln|cos(x)| + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this expression gives:\n\nln|cos(4)| + C\n\nNow, if we simply take the natural log of both sides, the expression becomes:\n\nln(C + ln|cos(4)|)\n\nTherefore, if we take the constant C out of the natural log, we get:\n\nC = ln(C + ln|cos(4)|)\n\nNow, we need to solve for C.
