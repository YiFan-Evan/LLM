[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we get ln(e^4) + C = ln(e^4) + ln(e^C). Since ln(e^x) = x - 1, the final expression is 4 - 1 + C. This result is an integer if C is also an integer. If C is not an integer, the result will be rounded down to the next lowest integer.\n\nTherefore, the final result is 3, rounded down."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^x + x is e^x + x + C, where C is a constant.
