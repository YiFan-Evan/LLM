[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

The indefinite integral is:\n\n\u222bsin(x)/x dx = -cos(x)/x^2 + C\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the result, we get:\n\n\u222bsin(4)/4 dx = -cos(4)/4^2 + C = -0.35296928367678 + C\n\nSince we excluded the constant C, we can simply ignore the last term and take the first one as the final result. Therefore, the integer result of the expression is -0.35.
