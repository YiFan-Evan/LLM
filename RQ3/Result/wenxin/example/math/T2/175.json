[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Differentiate the function: (1+e^x)*ln(x) = e^x + e^x*ln(x)\n2. Subtract the constant term (1): e^x + e^x*ln(x) - 1\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral is: e^x*ln(x) - x.\n\nNow, if you substitute 'x=4' into this expression, the result will be:\n\ne^4*ln(4) - 4 = 126\n\nNote that since this result is an irrational number, you should round down to get an integer result, which in this case is 126."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1+e^x)*ln(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5*((1+e^x)*ln(x)) is: 5*e^x*ln(x) - 5*x.\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into this expression, the result is:\n\n5*e^4*ln(4) - 5*4 = 177\n\nAgain, since this result is an irrational number, you should round down to get an integer result, which in this case is 177."}]
