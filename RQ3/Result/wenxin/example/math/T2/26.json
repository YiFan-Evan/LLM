[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get ln(e^4) + C = ln(e^4) + ln(e) + C. Since ln(e) = 1, the final expression is ln(e^4) + C, which simplifies to 4ln(e) + C. Since C is an unknown constant, it is possible to adjust the constant value until the expression equals a specific integer result. Rounding down, we get the integer result 4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5*(e^x) is 5*ln(e^x) + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get 5*ln(e^4) + C = 5*ln(e^4) + 5*ln(e) + C. Since ln(e) = 1, the final expression is 5*ln(e^4) + 5 + C.
