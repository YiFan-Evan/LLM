[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

The indefinite integral of ln(x) is 1/x, and the indefinite integral of (1 + x) is 1 + x. Therefore, the indefinite integral of ln(x) * (1 + x) is (ln(x) + 1)/x + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTo substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we simply replace x with 4: (ln(4) + 1)/4 + C.\n\nFinally, to provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down, we need to simplify the expression and round down the result. Here's what we get:\n\n((ln(4)) + 1) / 4 = 0\n\nSo, the final result is 0 rounded down to an integer.
