[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x)).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-10'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)/e^x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x)/e^x is: 1/e^x + C. Substituting 'x=4' into the result, we get: 1/e^4 + C. Rounding down, the final result is: 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(ln(x)/e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5*(ln(x)/e^x) is: 5/e^x + 5*ln(x) + C. Substituting 'x=4' into the result, we get: 5/e^4 + 5*ln(4) + C. Rounding down, the final result is: 1.\n\nNote that if you're rounding down, the integer part of the expression may still have a fractional component after rounding, even if the whole number would have been greater than or equal to some target number (such as 5) had the answer not been rounded. You're likely still to see this with rounding, so be sure to set a target number that you're willing to accept as the final result."}]
