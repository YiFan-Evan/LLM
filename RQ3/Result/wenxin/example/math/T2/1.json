[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x)).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-10'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sinh(x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of sinh(x) is (sec\u00b2x + C), where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get (sec\u20744 + C).\n\nSimplifying this, we get: (sec\u20744 + C) = 25.3883 rounded down to an integer, we get 25.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression after substituting 'x=4' is 25."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sinh(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5 * sinh(x) is 5 * (sec\u00b2x + C), where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get 5 * (sec\u20744 + C).\n\nSimplifying this, we get: 5 * (sec\u20744 + C) = 79.485 rounded down to an integer, we get 79.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression after substituting 'x=4' is 79."}]
