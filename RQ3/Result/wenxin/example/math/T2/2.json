[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x)).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-10'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of (1+x) is 1 + x + C, where C is a constant. To substitute 'x=4', we get the value 1 + 4 + C. However, without knowing the value of C, we cannot provide an exact result.\n\nTo simplify the process, let's take a guess for C and move on: Let's say C=0. After substituting 'x=4', we get the result 1 + 4 + 0 = 5. This is an integer result that represents the final result of the expression after rounding down."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5*(1+x) is 5 + 5*x + C, where C is a constant.
