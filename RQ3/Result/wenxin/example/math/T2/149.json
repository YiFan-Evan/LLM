[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x)).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-10'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: cos(x)/x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function cos(x)/x is (-sin(x))/x^2 + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral gives the value of -sin(4)/16 + C. However, there is no information about C in the given problem, so we need to solve for C and then calculate the final result.\n\nTo solve for C, we need to integrate the function cos(x)/x again to get the indefinite integral of cos(x) - x*sin(x)/x^2 + C, and then evaluate it at x=4. This gives us C = -sin(4) + 4*cos(4) + C0, where C0 is an integration constant.\n\nNow that we have C, we can calculate the final result by substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral of cos(x)/x, which gives us the value of (-sin(4))/16 + (-sin(4) + 4*cos(4) + C0). To simplify this expression, we can use the identities sin(4) = 4*sin(4)/4 and cos(4) = 3*sin(4)/5 - sqrt[3]*cos(4)/5. After simplifying, we get (-2/5)*sqrt[3]*cos(4). Since this result is a negative integer (represented by an integer), you can round it down to find its final value, which is -18 (as shown here: -(sqrt[3]/5))."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(cos(x)/x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function 5*(cos(x)/x) is 5*(-sin(x))/x^2 + C, where C is a constant.
