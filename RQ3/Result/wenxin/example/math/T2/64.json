[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

To substitute 'x=4', we get -e^(-4) + C. However, without knowing the value of C, it's difficult to give you a precise result.

To substitute 'x=4', we get 5 * e^(-4) + C. Once again, without knowing the value of C, it's difficult to give you a precise result. You can try to find a value for C that makes the result more meaningful to you. In this case, if we set C = 0, we get the result 5."}]
