[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x)).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-10'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sinh(x)/x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of sinh(x)/x is: ln(sinh(x)) + C. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get ln(sinh(4)) + C. The final result is an integer, which is approximately 1.37."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sinh(x)/x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5*(sinh(x)/x) is: 5*ln(sinh(x)) + C.
