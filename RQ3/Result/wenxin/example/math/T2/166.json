[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x)).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-10'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sin(x)*sin(sin(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x) * sin(sin(x)), we need to find the derivative of the inner function sin(sin(x)) with respect to x. We can use the chain rule for this. The derivative of sin(sin(x)) with respect to x is sin(x) * cos(sin(x)). Now, we can integrate this function with respect to x to get the indefinite integral: Integrate(sin(x) * cos(sin(x)), x) = -cos(sin(x)) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this indefinite integral, we get -cos(sin(4)) + C. To find the value of C, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral at x=4. To do this, we need to find the value of sin(4) and cos(sin(4)). We can use the trigonometric identities for these values: sin(4) = 4/\u03c0 \u2248 0.64575, cos(sin(4)) = cos(0.64575) \u2248 0.97766. Now, we can evaluate the indefinite integral at x=4: -0.97766 - 0 + C = 0 + C, which implies C = 9. Therefore, the final result of the expression is 9.\n\nNote: This result is rounded down to the nearest integer.
