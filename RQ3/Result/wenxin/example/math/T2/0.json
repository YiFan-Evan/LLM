[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get ln(e^4) + C = ln(e^4) + ln(e) + C. Now, to find the integer result, we need to find the integer value of C, which can be obtained by evaluating the indefinite integral with 'x=4' and setting the constant C to 0. Therefore, the final result is ln(e^4) + 1, which is approximately 5.\n\nTherefore, the integer result of the expression is 5.
