[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x)).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-10'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sinh(sin(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of the function sinh(sin(x)), we can use the derivative of sinh(x) = cosh(x) and the derivative of cosh(x) = sinh(x) + cosh(x). Therefore, the indefinite integral is:\n\n\u222bsinh(sin(x))dx = \u222bcosh(cos(x))dx\n\nNow, we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus to integrate this expression:\n\n\u222bcosh(cos(x))dx = cosh(cos(x)) + C\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this expression, we simply replace 'cos(x)' with 'cos(4)' in the right hand side:\n\ncosh(cos(4)) + C\n\nThe indefinite integral now becomes an expression with a constant C on the right hand side. We can move this term outside of the integral sign to isolate it, resulting in:\n\nC + cosh(cos(4)) = C + cosh(0.8773502698258396)\n\nFinally, to provide an integer result, we need to round down to the nearest integer. Since cosh(0.877...) is approximately 1.258628778404... and this number is already an integer approximation of cosh, we can round it down to 1, resulting in:\n\n1. When evaluated at x=4, the indefinite integral results in the integer value 1. Please note that cosh is an indefinite hyperbolic function that has a non-integer value for x=4.
