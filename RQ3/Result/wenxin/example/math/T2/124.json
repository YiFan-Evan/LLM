[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into this expression gives the result (sin(4))^2 + C. To find the integer result, we need to evaluate the sine of 4. The sine of 4 is approximately -0.965, so the final expression is (0.965)^2 + C, which is approximately 9.625 rounded down to give the integer result 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sin(x)^2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5 * (sin(x))^2 is 5 * (sin(x))^2 + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this expression gives the result 5 * (sin(4))^2 + C. To find the integer result, we need to evaluate the sine of 4 and multiply by 5.
