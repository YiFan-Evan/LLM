[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x)).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-10'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sinh(x)/x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of sinh(x)/x is -cosh(x) + C, where C is a constant. Substituting x=4 into this expression gives -cosh(4) + C. To find the final result, we need to know the value of C. Unfortunately, we don't have that information from your description. You can try plugging in different values for C to see what happens to the result. When C is 0, the final result is -2.0489357949686343.
