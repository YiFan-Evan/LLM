Substituting 'x=4' into the result gives e^4 + C. To find the integer result, we need to know the value of C. Without that information, we can only approximate the result by rounding down. Assuming C is a positive integer, the approximate result would be 7.53777263932325e+04. If C is a real number, the result would be different.
