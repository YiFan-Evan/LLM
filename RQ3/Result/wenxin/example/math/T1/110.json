[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sin(x)/x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of sin(x)/x is -cos(x)/x^2 + C, where C is a constant. To substitute 'x=4', you can add 2*pi/360 (a typical convention to calculate the angles in degrees in the 0-360 range).\n\nNow, we can replace x with 4 in the indefinite integral, resulting in the expression:\n\n(-cos(4)/4^2) + C\n\nSince C is a constant, it cancels out, and you only need to round down the negative cosine of 4. This results in the integer -1.\n\nTherefore, the final result is -1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sin(x)/x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of sin(x)/x is -cos(x)/x^2 + C, where C is a constant.
