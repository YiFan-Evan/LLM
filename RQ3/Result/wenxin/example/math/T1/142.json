[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Similarly, the indefinite integral of sinh(x) is (1 + sinh(x)) / cosh(x), where cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x) / 2.
