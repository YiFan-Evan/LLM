[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^(1/x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now, let's calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^(1/x). The indefinite integral is: ln(x) * e^(-1/x).\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we get: ln(4) * e^(-1/4) = ln(4) * (1/e)^(-1/4) = 1.7626985956565895.\n\nRounding down to an integer, we get 1. Please note that rounding down is used to approximate the result with the nearest integer, without taking into account the fractional part."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now, let's calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^(1/x).
