[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

However, if we assume that C is a positive integer, the final result would be:\n\n-sin(ln(4)) + 1 = -1.\n\nThe final result is an integer number representing the final result of the expression, which is -1. Please round down to get the integer result."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(ln(x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, I misunderstood the question before. Now I understand that the function is cos(ln(x)).\n\nThe indefinite integral of the function is: -sin(ln(x)) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we get: -sin(ln(4)) + C.\n\nIf we assume that C is a positive integer, the final result would be: -sin(ln(4)) + 5.\n\nSo the final result rounded down is 5."}]
