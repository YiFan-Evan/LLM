We need to find the derivative of sin(x) * sinh(x) with respect to x, which is sin(x) * cosh(x) + sin(x). Now, let's calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x) * cosh(x) + sin(x) with respect to x. The indefinite integral is 1/cos(x) * cosh(x) + x. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get 2*cosh(4) + 4 = 6*cosh(4). Now, we need to evaluate the value of the cosh(4) function, which is approximately 3.765787. Finally, the integer result of the expression is 21.\n\nThe final result is: 21."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sin(x)*sinh(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, I got it wrong again. Now I will correct it. The indefinite integral of sin(x) * sinh(x) is: -cosh(x) * sin(x) + x. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get -3*sinh(4) + 4 = -7*cosh(4).
