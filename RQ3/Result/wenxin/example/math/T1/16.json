[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral gives ln(e^4) + C.\n\nTo find the integer result, we need to know the value of C. If we assume that C is 0, then the final expression is ln(e^4). The result of ln(e^4) is approximately 4, rounded down to give the integer result 4. If C is not 0, the final expression will be different."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, I misunderstood the question before. The indefinite integral of e^x is ln(e^x). Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral gives ln(e^4). The result of ln(e^4) is approximately 4.
