[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sin(x)^2."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of sin(x)^2 is (1/2) * sin(x) * 2 * sin(x) + C.

Substituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get the result: 2 + C.\n\nI can round down the final result to 2, but it's worth noting that C is an unknown constant. When we substitute 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get the indefinite result. We can only solve for C by integrating the expression with another variable, or by solving a differential equation."}]
