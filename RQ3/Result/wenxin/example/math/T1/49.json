Substituting x = 4 into this result gives ln(4) * cos(4) - 4. The indefinite integral calculates the change in a function over a specific amount of time, without specifying a starting or ending point. To get a specific value, you would need to integrate again starting from that point, and then subtract the result from the initial value. For example, to find the area under the curve from 0 to 4, you would integrate again starting from 4, find the resulting value, and subtract it from 1 to get the area. If you were to do so here, you would get 0.\n\nTherefore, the final integer result of the expression is 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(x)*sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x) * sin(x) is ln(x) * cos(x).
