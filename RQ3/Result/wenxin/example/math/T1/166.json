If you take y=sin(4) as an example, then sin(y) will be approximately 0.667 and cos(y) will be approximately 0.767.\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n\u222bsin(x)*sin(sin(4))dx \u2248 sin(4)*(\u2212cos(y)) = 0.667 \u00d7 (\u22120.767) = -0.526, rounded down to an integer result of -5.\n\nSo, when x=4, the indefinite integral of sin(x)*sin(sin(x)) is approximately equal to -5.
