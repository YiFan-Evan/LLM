[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the original function (1+x)/ln(x), we get:\n\n(1+4)/ln(4) = 5/ln(4)\n\nIn order to make the result a simple integer, we need to replace the C with -1, which leaves us with:\n\n10 - 1 = 9\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression after substituting 'x=4' is 9.
