The indefinite integral becomes ln(u) + c, where c is a constant. Substituting x = 4, we get ln(1/4) + c = ln(1/4) + c. Now, we need to find the value of c.\n\nThe indefinite integral of 1/e^x is ln(1/e^x), which equals ln(1) - ln(e^x). Substituting x = 4, we get ln(1) - ln(e^4). Now, we can simplify this expression by using the property of natural logarithms that ln(1) = 0. Therefore, the final result is -ln(e^4), which equals -4.\n\nThe final expression after rounding down is -4. Please note that I rounded down the result to avoid unnecessary numbers. If you prefer to have more digits, I can provide you with the exact result."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1/e^x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I've calculated the indefinite integral of (1/e^x) and found that it equals -ln(e^x) + c, where c is a constant.
