[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

So, the indefinite integral of sinh(x^2) is 2x*sinh(x^2) + c.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we need to multiply by 2x and replace c with 0. So, the final expression is:\n\n2*4*sinh(4^2)\n\nThe result of this expression is approximately 76.7633 rounded down to an integer. Therefore, the final result is 76."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sinh(x^2)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of sinh(x^2) is 2x*sinh(x^2) + c, where c is a constant.
