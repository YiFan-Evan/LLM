[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

To substitute 'x=4' into this result, you would need to replace ln(x) with ln(4) and then add the constant C back in. This would give you the indefinite integral of (1/ln(4)) = 1/ln(4) + C.\n\nNow, to find the value of 'x=4' in this expression, you would need to solve for ln(4) to find the value of the constant C. ln(4) = 2, so the final expression would be 1/2 + C.\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, you would need to round down this number to the nearest integer. Since 1/2 + C is approximately 2, you would round down to 2.
