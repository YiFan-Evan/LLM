[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result, we get ln(e^4) + C. To find the integer result, we need to know the value of C. You said the answer should be a single integer number representing the final result, without any additional words. If we assume that C=0, then the final result is ln(e^4). The integer value of ln(e^4) rounded down is 4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, I misunderstood the question before. The indefinite integral of e^x is ln(e^x). Substituting 'x=4' into the result, we get ln(e^4). The integer value of ln(e^4) rounded down is 4. Thank you for your patience and attention."}]
