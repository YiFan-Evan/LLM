[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)*(1/x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x) / x is ln(x) - x. Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives ln(4) - 4. The final result is 1 rounded down, which is the integer 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(x)*(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x) * (1/x) is ln(x) - x. Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives ln(4) - 4. The final result is 0 rounded down, which is the integer 0. This result represents the final result of the expression, with no additional words needed."}]
