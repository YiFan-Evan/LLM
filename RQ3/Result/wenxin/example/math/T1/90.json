[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Now, the indefinite integral of sin(ln(x)) is 0. If you want to substitute 'x=4' into this expression, you can get 0 after rounding down."}]
