[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

So, we can evaluate the final expression by taking the 'C' term and subtracting it from the value of the integral:\n\n(-0.8359232944589388 - 2) = -2.8359232944589388\n\nThe final result is an integer, so it rounds down to -3.
