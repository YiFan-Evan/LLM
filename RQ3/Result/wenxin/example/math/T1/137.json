[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral gives us 4ln4 + C. Since ln4 is an infinite decimal, we cannot represent it as a single integer. If you are certain of the exact value of C, you can replace it with an appropriate constant and obtain a single integer result. Otherwise, it's better to round down to the nearest integer.
