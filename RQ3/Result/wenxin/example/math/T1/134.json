[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^sin(x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of e^sin(x), we need to apply the derivative rules for sine and exponential functions. We can write the indefinite integral as follows:\n\n\u222b e^sin(x) dx = \u222b e^(sin(x)) d(sin(x))\n\nLet's take a closer look at each term:\n\n1. Integral of e^(sin(x)) : Using the derivative rule for exponentials, we know that the derivative of e^x is e^x, so this integral is e^(sin(x)) * sin(x).\n2. Derivative of sin(x): We have that sin(x)' = cos(x).\n\nSo, putting it all together, we get:\n\n\u222b e^(sin(x)) d(sin(x)) = e^(sin(x)) * cos(x) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTo substitute 'x=4', we simply replace sin(x) with sin(4). We can simplify the expression to:\n\n\u222b e^(sin(4)) d(sin(4)) = e^(sin(4)) * cos(4) + C, where C is still a constant.\n\nThe final result after integration will depend on the value of C, but without it we can simplify further by using the properties of sine and cosine:\n\n\u222b e^(sin(4)) d(sin(4)) = e^(sin(4)) * (cos(4) + \u221e), where \u221e represents a value that approaches infinity as sin(4) approaches 1 from above.\n\nWhen sin(4) is approximately 0.793, the result will be approximately 2.39.
