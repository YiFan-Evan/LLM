The expression (1/x) is already an indefinite integral. To calculate its indefinite integral, we can use the formula for indefinite integral of a fraction:\n\n\u222b(1/x)dx = -ln(x) + C\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nIf you want to evaluate the indefinite integral with 'x=4', you can simply substitute 'x=4' into the expression:\n\n\u222b(1/4)dx = -ln(4) + C\n\nBut if you mean the expression (1/(4-3)), it is already an expression of x. The indefinite integral of this expression is:\n\n\u222b(1/(4-3)dx) = \u222b(1/dx) = x + C\n\nwhere C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we get:\n\nx + C = 4 + C\n\nC will be discarded because it is not needed for this problem.
