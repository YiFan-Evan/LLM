[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives ln(e^4) + C = ln(e^4) + ln(e^C). To find the integer result, we need to know the value of C.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have enough information to calculate the constant C. We only know that the indefinite integral of e^x is ln(e^x) + C, but we don't know what C is. We need to know what value to substitute into the expression to get an integer result, but without knowing what C is, we can't do that.\n\nWe can try different values of C and see if we get a number that we recognize as an integer. However, it is important to note that these are only approximate results, as they depend on the value of C.
