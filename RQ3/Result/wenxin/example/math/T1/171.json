[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get -ln|cos(sin(4))| + C = -ln|cos(sin(4))| + C'.\n\nTo find the final result, we need to know the value of C.

In this case, it is -3.\n\nNote: This answer assumes that sin(4) is approximately 0.57735 (the sine of 4 degrees), which is a commonly used approximation for trigonometric functions.
