[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

To substitute 'x=4', we need to add 4 to the indefinite integral result. The final result is 5 + 4 + C.\n\nIf you round down the result, it becomes 9, which is an integer.
