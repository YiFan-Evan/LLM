[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get the result 0.5303020508859846.\n\nTherefore, the final result is rounded down to 0. Please note that this is an integer result without any additional words."}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x) is 1/x. Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get the result 0. Subtracting 2 from the result gives us 0 - 2 = -2. The final result is -2.
