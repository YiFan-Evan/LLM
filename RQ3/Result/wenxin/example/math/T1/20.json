Substituting x = 4, we get the result: 1.3996.\n\nTo round down to an integer, we would take the integer part of the result, which is 1.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression after substituting x = 4 is 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sinh(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, I misunderstood the function expression.
