Let's use the derivative of sin(x) as the indefinite integral of x^2/sin(x). The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), so the indefinite integral of x^2/sin(x) becomes 2x/cos(x). Now let's substitute 'x=4' into this expression:\n\n\u222b(x^2/sin(x)) = \u222b(4^2/sin(4)) = \u222b(16/sin(4)) = 16/cos(4)\n\nNow we need to evaluate this expression at 'x=4'.
