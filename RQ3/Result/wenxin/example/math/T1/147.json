[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: cos(x)*(1+x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function cos(x)*(1+x) is:\n\n\u222bcos(x)*(1+x)dx = -sin(x)*(1+x) + C\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral:\n\n\u222b(cos(4)*(1+4)) = -sin(4)*(1+4) + C\n\nNow, the value of the indefinite integral does not include the constant C, so you will have to determine its value from other information or observation.
