[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x*x^2."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x * x^2, we can use the integration formula: \u222bu(x)v(x)dx = u(x)v(x) + \u222bu(x)v'(x)dx.\n\nThe indefinite integral of e^x * x^2 is:\n\u222be^x * x^2 dx = e^x * x^2 + \u222be^x * 2x dx.\n\nThe second integral can be integrated easily using the formula: \u222be^x * d(a*x) = e^x * a*x + C, where a is a constant. In this case, a = 2. So the integral becomes:\n\u222be^x * 2x dx = e^x * x^2 + C1, where C1 is an integration constant.\n\nCombining both results, we get:\n\u222be^x * x^2 dx = e^x * x^2 + C1 + e^x * x*C, where C is another integration constant.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we simply need to evaluate the integral with x=4. We have:\n\u222be^(4) * (4)^2 dx = e^(4) * (4)^2 + C1 + e^(4)*4*C = 64 + C1 + 64*C.\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down. The final result is: 64 (rounded down to the nearest integer)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x*x^2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^x * x^2 is: e^x * x^2 + \u222be^x * 2xdx. The second integral can be integrated easily using the formula: \u222be^x * d(a*x) = e^x * a*x + C, where a is a constant. Therefore, the indefinite integral becomes e^x * x^2 + e^x * x * C + C1, where C1 is an integration constant. To substitute x = 4, we need to evaluate the integral with x = 4 and round down the final result to an integer. The final result is: e^(4) * x^3 + 4e^(4) * x + C rounded down to 33.\n\nTo confirm the answer, you can try using other methods such as the fundamental theorem of calculus to solve the problem. The result should be the same."}]
