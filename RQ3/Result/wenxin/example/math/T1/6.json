[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of (1+x) is 1 + x + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral gives 5. The final result is an integer 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of (1+x) is 1 + x + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral gives 5. The final result is an integer 5. If you want to calculate the indefinite integral of (1+x), you can use a calculator or computer program to find the indefinite integral of the function. The indefinite integral is the sum of the indefinite integral of the function and the constant C. In this case, the indefinite integral of (1+x) is 1 + x + C, where C is a constant. If you substitute 'x=4' into this expression, you will get the final result of 5."}]
