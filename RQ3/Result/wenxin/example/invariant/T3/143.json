[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the given Python program is:\n\n`arr[i] + sum_value = arr[i+1]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the sum of the elements in the array up to and including the current index `i` is equal to the first element of the next iteration of the loop.\n\nIn each iteration, the value of `sum_value` is increased by the current element `arr[i]`, and the index `i` is increased by 1.
