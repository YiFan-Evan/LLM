The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm is:\n\n\n```makefile\ntemp_value = arr[i]\nleft_index = i - 1\n```\nThe loop invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted correctly and in ascending order before the start of the next iteration.\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1. Initially, the array is not sorted.\n2. In the first iteration, the i-th element is compared with its left neighbor (left_index). If the i-th element is greater than its left neighbor, then it is moved to its correct position in the sorted array. This process continues until there is no element greater than the i-th element left in the array.\n3. After moving the i-th element to its correct position, the loop invariant ensures that all elements to the right of the i-th element are also in ascending order.\n4. The loop invariant is maintained because each iteration moves an element to its correct position in the sorted array.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant proves that the insertion sort algorithm correctly sorts the array in each iteration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    f = len(arr)\n    while f > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        f -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4e86\u60a8\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u6839\u636e\u60a8\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u73b0\u5728\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06\u201ci\u201d\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u201cz\u201d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8868\u793a\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u518d\u6b21\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u7684\u6307\u6b63\uff01"}]
