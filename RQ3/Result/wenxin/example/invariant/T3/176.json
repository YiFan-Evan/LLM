[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the algorithm is `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[q-1]`, which ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the outer while loop.\n\nThe code uses a nested while loop to perform the insertion sort algorithm. The outer loop iterates from `q` to `1` (or `len(arr)-1` if `q` is initialized as `len(arr)`), while the inner loop moves elements to their correct positions in the array using comparisons with the elements that precede them.\n\nThe invariant `z = i` is used within the inner loop to compare the element `arr[i]` with its correct position in the sorted array. It ensures that the elements in `arr[i]` to `arr[q-1]` are in sorted order, with `arr[i]` being the smallest element in its correct position.\n\nFinally, the code decreases `q` by one at the end of each iteration of the outer loop, which ensures that the sorted order is maintained throughout the entire array.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns regarding the provided code, please feel free to ask!"}]
