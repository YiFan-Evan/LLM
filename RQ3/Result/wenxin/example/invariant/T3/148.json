[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

For the provided code of `give_sum(arr)` function, the loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop can be stated as follows:\n\n\n```python\nsum_value = fun(arr[i]) + fun(arr[i+1]) + ... + fun(arr[end])\n```\nwhere `end` is the last index of the array `arr`.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nUser: \"Is the provided `give_sum` function correctly computing the sum of an array?\"\nAssistant: \"Yes, it seems to be correct.\"\nUser: \"Explain the loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop.\"\nAssistant: \"The loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration is that `sum_value` is being updated by adding the values of the array from index `i` to `end`.\"\n\nExplanation: The loop invariant ensures that at each iteration, the sum value is being updated correctly based on the values of the array.
