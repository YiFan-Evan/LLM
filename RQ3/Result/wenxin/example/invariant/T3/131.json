[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

In your code, you have written `while 2 * l < len(arr):` but the loop should stop when `len(arr) - l` becomes zero. Also, the `l` should be decreased in each iteration and not increased. Here's a corrected version of your code:\n\n\n```python\ndef give_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    l = len(arr)\n    while len(arr) - l > 0:\n        mid_value = arr[l]\n        l -= 1\n    return mid_value\n```\nIn this corrected version, the loop condition ensures that the loop stops when `len(arr) - l` becomes zero, which is the desired behavior. The `l` is decreased in each iteration to exclude the last element from the sum."}]
