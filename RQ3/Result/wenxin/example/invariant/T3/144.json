[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop should start with `e = 0` and decrease `e` until it reaches 0. The corrected program should be:\n\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[e]\n        e += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\nThis corrected program correctly computes the sum of all elements in the array arr using a while loop with a correct loop invariant."}]
