[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k < len(arr):\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = len(arr)\\n    while k > 0:\\n        k -= 1\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[k]->arr[len(arr)-1])'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr):\n        z = h + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[h]:\n                temp = arr[h]\n                arr[h] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Now I can answer your question.\n\nLoop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the provided program is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] for all i from 0 to len(arr) - 2`\n\nIn the inner while loop, the elements in the array are swapped if they are in the wrong order. This ensures that the smallest element is always at its correct position at the end of the loop. Therefore, the loop invariant is satisfied at the end of each iteration.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    h = len(arr)\n    while h > 0:\n        h -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[h]:\n                temp = arr[h]\n                arr[h] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Certainly! Now I can answer your question.\n\nLoop invariant for the provided program is:\n\n`arr[0] <= arr[1] <= arr[2] <= ... <= arr[len(arr)-1]`\n\nThe program uses selection sort algorithm to sort the array. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, picking the minimum element at each iteration and swapping it with the first element. This process continues until the entire array is sorted. Therefore, the loop invariant ensures that the array is sorted at the end of each iteration.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions!"}]
