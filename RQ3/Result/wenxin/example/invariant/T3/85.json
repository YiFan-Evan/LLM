[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k < len(arr):\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = len(arr)\\n    while k > 0:\\n        k -= 1\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[k]->arr[len(arr)-1])'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_last(arr):\n    last_value = arr[0]\n    f = 0\n    while f < len(arr):\n        last_value = arr[f]\n        f += 1\n    return last_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the loop invariant for the `give_last` function:\n\n`last_value_is_the_last_element = arr[f] == arr[-1]`\n\nThis invariant states that the value of `last_value` at each iteration of the loop is the last element of the array `arr`.\n\nProof:\n\n1.
