[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

It assumes that `fun` doesn't overflow, underflow, or otherwise cause an incorrect result. If you're using a language that doesn't have a built-in sum function, you'll need to provide your own implementation of `fun`."}]
