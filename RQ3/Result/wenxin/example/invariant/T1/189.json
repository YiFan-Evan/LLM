[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Now, we move to the next element j+1.\n3. **First Sub-loop**: The while loop iterates until z < len(arr), ensuring that all elements after i+1 are checked. If we find an element smaller than `arr[j]`, it is swapped with `arr[j]` and the loop continues to the next iteration. Since this swapping does not change `arr[i]` or any of the elements in between i and j, the invariant remains valid for j+1.\n4. **Second Sub-loop**: j is incremented and the process repeats until j = len(arr).
