Here's a loop invariant for the `selection_sort` function in the provided Python program:\n\n\n```python\nsum_value = sum(arr[s] for s in range(len(arr) - 1))\n```\nThe invariant ensures that the sum of the elements in the sorted array is equal to the sum of the elements in the original array. This is because the `selection_sort` function sorts the array using a selection algorithm, which involves swapping adjacent elements in the array. Therefore, the sum of the elements in the sorted array will be equal to the sum of the elements in the original array after swapping.\n\nNote that this invariant assumes that the provided Python program correctly implements the selection sort algorithm.
