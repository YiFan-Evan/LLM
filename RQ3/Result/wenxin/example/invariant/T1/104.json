[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k < len(arr):\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k <= len(arr) - 1:\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        if e == id:\n            member_value = arr[e]\n        e += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the given program is:\n\n`member_value_value = fun(arr[member_value]->arr[member_value])`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the value of `member_value` is updated correctly in each iteration of the loop.
