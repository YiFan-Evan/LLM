[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the selection sort algorithm can be expressed as follows:\n\n\n```python\nsum_value = sum(arr[i-1] for i in range(1, len(arr)))\n```\nIn each iteration, the algorithm selects the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array and moves it to its correct position. Therefore, the sum of the elements in the unsorted part after each iteration should be equal to the initial sum. This invariant ensures that the algorithm maintains the partial correctness of the program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    p = 0\n    while p <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = p + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[p]:\n                temp = arr[p]\n                arr[p] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        p += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Great!
