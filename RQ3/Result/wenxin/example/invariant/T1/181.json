[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k < len(arr):\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k <= len(arr) - 1:\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    b = 0\n    while b < len(arr):\n        z = b + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[b]:\n                temp = arr[b]\n                arr[b] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        b += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is a loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the provided Python program:\n\n\n```less\narr_sorted[i] = selection_sort(arr[i]->arr[i+1])\n```\nIn the provided program, the function `selection_sort` is used to sort the elements of the array `arr` using the selection sort algorithm.

The loop invariant states that the sorted version of the `i-th` element of the array `arr` is equal to the sorted version of the elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[i+1]` using the `selection_sort` function.\n\nNow, for each iteration, you will also need to have a post-condition which proves that after the iteration, the sorted array `arr` is indeed returned. You can prove this by using an appropriate post-invariant which includes an expression involving `arr[0]`, `arr[-1]`, and the sorted array `arr`. Here's an example of such a post-invariant:\n\n`post_invariant = arr == sorted(arr)`\n\nNote that in order to prove the post-condition, you will need to use a proof method such as model checking or symbolic execution, which are beyond the scope of this question.\n\nIf you are asking for a different question, please provide more context and information."}]
