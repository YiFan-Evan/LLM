[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

If you're unsure about how to write these, it's a good idea to look up some resources on how selection sort algorithm works to ensure that your implementation is as efficient as possible."}]
