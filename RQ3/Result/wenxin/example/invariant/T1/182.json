Here is the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[len(arr)-1]`\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The selection sort algorithm sorts the input array `arr` in ascending order using the swap operation.\n* At each iteration, the algorithm finds the minimum element `arr[c]` from the unsorted part `arr[c+1:]` of the array and moves it to its correct position.\n* After moving the minimum element, the algorithm checks if there are any elements that are smaller than `arr[c]` in the unsorted part. If any such element is found, it is moved to its correct position.\n* This process continues until all elements in the array are sorted in ascending order.\n* The loop invariant ensures that the minimum element in the unsorted part `arr[c+1:]` is always `arr[i]` at each iteration of the inner loop.\n\nTherefore, the partial correctness of the program is proven."}]
