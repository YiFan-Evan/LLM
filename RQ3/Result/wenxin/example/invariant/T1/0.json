[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k < len(arr):\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k <= len(arr) - 1:\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    a = 0\n    while a < len(arr):\n        if arr[a] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[a]\n        a += 1\n    return max_value\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the `find_max` function is:\n\n\n```python\nmax_value_so_far = find_max(arr[:i])\n```\nwhere `arr[:i]` is the part of the array up to index `i`.

If you do that, you won't get the expected result. Incrementing `a` before checking for a greater value would work fine, but that's not what you have here. Please make the change as mentioned above."}]
