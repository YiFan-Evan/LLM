[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

Here's a loop invariant for the `selection_sort` function in the provided Python program:\n\n\n```python\nsum_value = sum(arr[k] for k in range(len(arr) - 1))\n```\nThe invariant states that at each iteration of the outer loop, the sum of the elements in the sorted subarray (from `arr[k]` to the end) is equal to the sum of the elements in the original array. This invariant proves the partial correctness of the program because it ensures that the sorted subarray is indeed a contiguous subset of the original array.\n\nNote that this invariant assumes that the provided program correctly implements the selection sort algorithm.

Thank you for clarifying. Here's the loop invariant for the modified `selection_sort` function:\n\n\n```python\nsum_value = sum(arr[k] for k in range(len(arr)))\n```\nThe invariant ensures that the sorted array is a contiguous subset of the original array by summing up the elements of the sorted subarray. It proves the partial correctness of the program because it ensures that the sorted subarray is indeed sorted in ascending order.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or need assistance with other parts of the code!"}]
