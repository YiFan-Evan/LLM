[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k < len(arr):\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = -1\\n    while k < len(arr) - 1:\\n        k += 1\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k])'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr):\n        if arr[m] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        m += 1\n    return count_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the `give_count` loop is:\n\n`count_value_i = count_value + 1`\n\nwhere `count_value_i` is the count value at the start of the i-th iteration, `count_value` is the count value at the start of the previous iteration, and `arr[m] == target` is true if the current element in the array is equal to the target.\n\nThis invariant ensures that the count value at the end of the loop is correct.
