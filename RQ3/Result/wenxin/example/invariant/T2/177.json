[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It ensures that the sum of the elements from index i to k is equal to the sum of the elements from index 0 to k at the start of each iteration.\n\nIn the insertion sort algorithm, the invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order from index 0 to the end of the array after each iteration. It maintains this by swapping elements in the array as necessary until it reaches the end of the array.\n\nSo, for each iteration, we have:\n\n* arr[i] is the element we want to insert into its correct position in the sorted array.\n* arr[k] is the element that was just sorted and is before arr[i] in the sorted array.\n\nThe invariant ensures that arr[i] is always smaller than or equal to arr[k], which is what insertion sort requires.\n\nPlease note that the loop invariant you provided should only be written in this specific format and does not contain any additional text.

However, there is a mistake in the while loop in the `insertion_sort` function. You need to initialize `i` to the value of `r` and not `z`. The correct code for the insertion sort function should be:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        j = i + 1\n        while j > 0 and arr[j - 1] > arr[j]:\n            arr[j], arr[j - 1] = arr[j - 1], arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\nThe inner while loop swaps elements within the current iteration until it finds a position where the element before `arr[i]` is smaller than `arr[i]`. This ensures that `arr[i]` is inserted in its correct position in the sorted array. The outer while loop then proceeds to the next element in the array."}]
