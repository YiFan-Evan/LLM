[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the given Python program is:\n\n`sum_value_i = sum_value_{i-1} + arr[a_i]`\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1. At the start of the loop, `sum_value_i` is set to `sum_value_{i-1}`, which is initialized to 0.\n2. Then, `arr[a_i]` is added to `sum_value_i`, which means `sum_value_i` will increase by the value of `arr[a_i]`.\n3. After adding `arr[a_i]` to `sum_value_i`, `a_i` is incremented by 1, which means the next element of the array is accessed.\n4. Since the loop condition is `a < len(arr)` and `a_i` is incremented each iteration, it follows that `a_i < len(arr)` for each iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant holds true for each iteration of the loop, proving the partial correctness of the program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    a = -1\n    while a < len(arr) - 1:\n        a += 1\n        sum_value += arr[a]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the given Python program is:\n\n`sum_value_i = sum_value_{i-1} + arr[a_i]`\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1.
