If you designed a place for an annoying critter to stay, you would probably want it to be a comfortable and safe environment for them. A cat condo would be a suitable option because it provides a safe and cozy space for cats to relax and sleep. The other options, such as spreading disease, swamps, and bug campers, are not suitable for creating a comfortable environment for animals.

Based on the provided information, including the association of certain words with the concept of a \"cat condo\", it can be inferred that designing a place for an annoying critter to stay would involve creating a comfortable and safe environment for them.
