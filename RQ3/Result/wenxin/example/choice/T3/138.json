(Since 'do like' is associated with the reason-words 'allocentric' and 'having_people_like_us_better', the model likely inferred that the person enjoys the activity because it is socially beneficial or popular among others. The reason-word 'born' may suggest that the person has a natural inclination or talent for the activity. 'Control' and 'ab_intra' may indicate that the person is able to fully engage in and immerse themselves in the activity, contributing to their enjoyment.
