Donald is a prominent figure for the federal government, so he likely spends a lot of time in Washington D.C., the capital city of the United States. This is because he is a member of the federal government and spends a significant amount of time in Washington D.C. to attend meetings, hearings, and other official events related to his job.

(Since the question mentions that Donald is a prominent figure for the federal government, the model assumes that he would spend a lot of time in a city that is closely associated with the national government.
