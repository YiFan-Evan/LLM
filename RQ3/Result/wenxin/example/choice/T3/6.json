Indiana. The sentence indicates that they passed a apple tree on their way to a racetrack and it indicates that they were headed to the track for the biggest motorsport spectacle in the world, which could only be Indianapolis 500 or a similar race, since Indy car events take place at tracks like Indianapolis. They said that it was broadcasted on TV, so they would watch it there and not in a park or anywhere else. Moreover, the description of New Jersey and Maryland doesn't fit at all, because the racetrack event mentioned here was at the local location, so they passed a tree and watched the event on their way to the racetrack, so they wouldn't go to New Jersey or Maryland to watch it.
