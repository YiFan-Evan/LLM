Summarizing main points and writing down information can be helpful for retaining the information, but speaking directly to the deaf person is the most effective way to convey information. Additionally, it is important to avoid closing one's mouth or may disagreeing with the deaf person, as this can be interpreted as disrespectful or offensive."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: How would you express information to a deaf person? (Since the person who is deaf may hear very little or nothing at all, talking may not be an effective way to express information to them.

When communicating with a deaf person, writing down information can be a more effective way to ensure they receive the main points, as it provides a more concrete and reliable way of conveying information.
