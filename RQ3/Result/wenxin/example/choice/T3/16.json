They are often equipped with traffic lights, signs, and barriers to control traffic and prevent accidents. Roads can also be used for high-speed travel, but they are not typically designed for it and may have slower traffic and less safety features. Race tracks are designed for racing cars and typically have very specific layouts and safety features. Alleyways are narrow passages between buildings and are not typically suitable for high-speed travel. Parking lots are not designed for high-speed travel and are typically used for parking vehicles. Therefore, the answer is \"freeway\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where do cars usually travel at very high speeds?
