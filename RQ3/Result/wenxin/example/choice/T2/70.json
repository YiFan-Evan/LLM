Therefore, if someone wanted lodging in a place where they already needed to be, a resort area would be the most likely option. A yurt is a type of tent or dwelling, and it is not suitable for long-term accommodation. Big cities are often crowded and expensive, and Michigan is a state in the United States, not a suitable place for lodging. Going on vacation is not a specific place where lodging is provided."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: He wanted lodging in the actual what, so that he was already where he needed to be?\nOptions: A. going on vacation B. michigan C. big city D. resort area E. a yurt"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As per the given context, the correct answer is D.
