They are designed for speed and have no or minimal traffic lights or stop signs, making them ideal for high-speed driving. Roads can also be used for high-speed travel, but they are not typically designed for it and may have traffic lights or stop signs that slow down traffic. Race tracks are designed specifically for high-speed racing and are not suitable for regular driving. Alleyways are narrow streets that are typically not suitable for high-speed travel. Parking lots are designated areas for parking cars and are not typically designed for high-speed travel. Therefore, the answer is \"freeway\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where do cars usually travel at very high speeds?\nOptions: A. parking lot B. alley C. race track D. road E. freeway"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This question has already been answered.
