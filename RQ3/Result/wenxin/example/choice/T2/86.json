The answer to the question \"What is the least likely immediate side effect of eating hamburger?\" is: **nausea**. All the other options mentioned in the options, A, B, C and D, have potential side effects or risks associated with eating hamburger. For instance, illness and health problems can occur due to various reasons like food poisoning or food allergies, while death is a rare but possible outcome of eating hamburger if it is contaminated or if the person has a pre-existing condition. However, nausea is a very rare side effect of eating hamburger."}]
