When you first meet a child, you typically ask her to dress herself, which is an appropriate way to greet a child. Other options such as asking questions, counting to ten, and asking for a costume are not commonly used when meeting a child for the first time.

As the given question asks about what to do when meeting a child for the first time, the only answer that is applicable is asking the child to dress herself, which is an appropriate way to greet a child.
