The type of material used for making furniture depends on the specific use and requirements of the furniture. For example, bamboo is a natural material that is often used for making outdoor furniture, while iron is commonly used for making industrial or commercial furniture, such as tables and chairs. Wood is commonly used for making furniture in general, but there are also many types of woods available that have different properties and textures. Plastic is commonly used for making some types of furniture, such as some types of chairs and tables, but it may not be suitable for all types of furniture or all types of environments. Therefore, my answer to the second question is C. Wood is a versatile material that can be used for making many types of furniture, and it is commonly used for this purpose."}]
