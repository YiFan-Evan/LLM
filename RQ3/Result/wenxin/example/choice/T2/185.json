Killing people is a very serious and unethical act that should not be done lightly or with any emotion other than horror and condemnation. Killing someone should not be seen as a cause for joy or satisfaction, but rather as a violation of human rights and a violation of the law. Therefore, the correct answer is A. terrible. \n\nA. terrible - This is the most appropriate emotion to describe the act of killing people, as it represents horror and condemnation.\n\nB. afraid - This emotion may be felt by those around the victim or by the victim themselves, but it is not an appropriate emotion to describe the act of killing people as it is an inappropriate reaction to violence and criminal acts.\n\nC. joy - This emotion is completely inappropriate for describing the act of killing people, as it represents a positive response to harm and violence, which is completely contrary to human decency and morality.\n\nD. going to prison - This emotion may be felt by those who witness or are involved in the crime, but it is not an appropriate emotion to describe the act itself.\n\nE. vengeance - This emotion may be felt by some individuals or groups after a killing, but it is not an appropriate emotion to describe the act of killing people as it represents seeking personal satisfaction and retribution, which is also contrary to human decency and morality.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A. terrible."}]
