D. hallway is not mentioned in the question and does not seem to be related to the situation described.

The correct answer is B. hallway. A linen closet in a hallway typically only has one overhead light, so it makes sense to repaint it a light color. The other options, such as A. bedroom, C. pool house, and D. home do not seem to fit the description provided. I apologize for the error."}]
