They are often more precise and efficient than humans, especially in repetitive or dangerous tasks. On the other hand, humans are still superior in creativity, critical thinking, and emotional intelligence, which machines still lack. Therefore, machines cannot replace humans in all tasks, but they can complement human work by performing certain tasks that humans cannot do."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What can machines do that humans cannot?\nOptions: A. fly B. see work C. answering questions D. perform work E. fail to work"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: D.
