Tide pools are small sheltered areas along the rocky coastlines of certain coastal regions where marine life can thrive. Aquariums are generally not considered suitable habitats for anemones because they are often too artificial and not conducive to their natural lifestyle. The other options are also incorrect because they do not match the description of a suitable habitat for anemones. Therefore, the correct answer is D. tide pool."}]
