Machines are also capable of performing tasks that require precision and accuracy, which humans may struggle with due to fatigue, distractions, or errors in judgment. However, machines still have limitations in performing tasks that require human-level reasoning, creativity, and decision-making. Therefore, the answer is B. Perform work."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What can machines do that humans cannot?\nOptions: E. fly D. see work C. answering questions B. perform work A. fail to work"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: E. fly\n\nMachines can perform a wide range of tasks, including flying, which humans are not capable of doing. Other options, such as seeing work, answering questions, performing work, and failing to work, are tasks that humans can perform as well as machines.
