University campus.\n\nAn auditorium is typically used for a lecture or presentation, where multiple people speak. However, if there is only one person speaking, it could be in a classroom or lecture hall on a university campus. There may be a small audience present, but it would not be considered a \"crowd\" because there is only one speaker. A park or theater would not typically have an auditorium with only one person speaking. Lights are not related to the question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where would there be an auditorium with only a single person speaking?\nOptions: E. park D. theater C. university campus B. crowd A. lights"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correct answer is E. Park.\n\nA park is a large open space where people gather for various activities, including listening to a single speaker. This is the most likely scenario where there would be an auditorium with only a single person speaking. A theater, university campus, crowd, and lights are not related to the question and are incorrect options."}]
