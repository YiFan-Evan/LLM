The man had a fear of illness, so he never visited friends who were sick persons. This is because visiting sick persons may involve visiting a hospital or doctor's office, which could potentially expose him to illness. In contrast, visiting a graveyard, elderly person, or hospital does not have the same potential risks as visiting sick persons."}]
