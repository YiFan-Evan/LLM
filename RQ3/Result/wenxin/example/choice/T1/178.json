Overstocking refers to purchasing more products than are actually needed, resulting in excess inventory that needs to be sold or otherwise disposed of. This does not necessarily result in running out of money or spending money, but may lead to excess inventory and therefore, comparison shopping or looking for a lower price may be necessary to clear the inventory.
