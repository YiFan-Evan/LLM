It is often found in coal-burning factories and smokestacks and has been shown to have adverse effects on human health, leading to various health problems and even early death. Therefore, it is the most likely option to lead to an early death. Poisonous gas, homicide, nuclear weapons, and cyanide are all causes of death, but they are not the most likely cause of early death."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: WHat leads to an early death?\nOptions: E. cyanide D. nuclear weapons C. cinder B. homicide A. poisonous gas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correct answer is E. Cyanide.\n\nCyanide is a highly poisonous gas that can be deadly in sufficient quantities. It is not related to smoking or pollution and has no other explanation or contributing factors to it leading to an early death.\n\nAll the other options in the list - Cinder, Homicide, Nuclear Weapons and Poisonous Gas - have contributing factors and/or reasons behind their occurrences and consequences that could lead to death, but are not as direct or immediate as cyanide. Therefore, the correct answer is E. cyanide."}]
