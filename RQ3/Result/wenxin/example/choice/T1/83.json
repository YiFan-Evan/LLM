Trust himself. A self-assured person is confident in their abilities and knowledge, and they typically trust their own judgment and decisions. They are not easily swayed by others' opinions or advice, but rather rely on their own experience and knowledge to guide their actions and decisions. Therefore, the answer to the question is E. Trust himself."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What does a self assured person often do?\nOptions: E. trust himself D. feel important C. know what time B. focused A. acknowledgment"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm sorry, but \"acknowledgment\" doesn't fit in this context. \"Acknowledgment\" typically refers to expressing gratitude or recognition for something, while the other options, such as \"feel important\", \"know what time\", \"focused\", and \"trust himself\" are all characteristics or behaviors of a self-assured person. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Acknowledge himself."}]
