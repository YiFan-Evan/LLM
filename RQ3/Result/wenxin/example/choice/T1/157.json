Therefore, it is likely to be found on a bed sheet. The other options are not likely to be the source of hard to read notes because they are not usually used for writing notes."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where is hard to read note likely to be?\nOptions: E. medical chart D. bed C. desk B. sheet music A. fridge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correct answer is E. medical chart. Medical charts are often used to record information about patients and are written in large fonts and with contrasting colors to make them easy to read. Therefore, it is more likely for a hard to read note to be found on a medical chart rather than other options."}]
