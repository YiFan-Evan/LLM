If you designed a place for an annoying critter to stay, you would probably want it to be a comfortable and safe environment for them. A swamp would be unsuitable for a critter to live in because it is wet and unpleasant. A bug campers habitat would be unsuitable for most critters because it is not a suitable environment for their needs. A place that spreads disease would also be unpleasant and unsafe for the critter.
