Examine thing.\n\nAs per the question, if you have curiosity but are blind and paralyzed, you would need to examine the thing that interests you. This is the most logical option because examining a thing requires touch and feeling, which you cannot do when blind and paralyzed.\n\nA. hear news - Although hearing news may be an option for some people, it is not a valid solution for someone who is blind and paralyzed.\n\nB. Analyze - Analyzing something requires sight and movement, which are not possible for someone who is blind and paralyzed.\n\nC. Go somewhere - Going somewhere requires movement, which is not possible for someone who is paralyzed.\n\nE. See favorite show - Although watching a favorite show may be enjoyable, it does not provide the information or understanding that you require as someone who is blind and paralyzed.\n\nTherefore, the only valid option is D.
