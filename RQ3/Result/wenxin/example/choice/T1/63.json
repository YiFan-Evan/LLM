Lions are known to be very territorial and aggressive when it comes to defending their territory or their cubs. However, if they sense that their competitor is timid, they may not take aggressive action towards them. Instead, they may adopt a defensive strategy, which means they will try to avoid a fight and use their strength and speed to outmaneuver their opponent and escape. Therefore, the answer is C.
