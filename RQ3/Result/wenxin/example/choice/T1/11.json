Listen to music. Listening to music is a common way for people to relax at night. It can help them relieve stress and anxiety and provide a relaxing atmosphere.

The correct answer is E. Stop worrying. Stopping worrying is an effective way to relax at night. This helps reduce stress and allows the individual to focus on other aspects of their life, such as relaxation activities like listening to music or reading a book. The other options, such as going to bed, checking mail, or finding time, may not necessarily provide the same level of relaxation as stopping worrying."}]
