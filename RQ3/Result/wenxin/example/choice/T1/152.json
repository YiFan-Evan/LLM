This is because most porches have low or no furniture, allowing a person to land safely on the ground or steps if they accidentally land on it. Other options like a table, backyard or park are unlikely places where a person would be stuck as they have items and structures that could potentially cause harm if accidentally landed on. The correct answer is therefore C. Porch."}]
