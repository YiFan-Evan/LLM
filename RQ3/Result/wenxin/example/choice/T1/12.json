The correct answer is E because cats are often known for their sharp claws, which help them hunt and climb trees. Cats do not typically have sharp teeth and are usually characterized by their striped, spotted or long hair. The whiskers are the tiny hairs on a cat's face that help it to sense objects and move objects with their face without scratching or causing damage. These whiskers do not directly represent what makes cats unique."}]
