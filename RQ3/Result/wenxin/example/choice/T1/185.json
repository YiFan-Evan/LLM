Killing people is a very serious and terrible act that should not be done lightly or casually. It is an act that should be condemned and punished severely by law. Therefore, it should not cause any positive emotions such as vengeance, joy, or fear. It should only cause feelings of regret, sorrow, and guilt. Therefore, the answer is E. terrible."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Killing people should not cause what emotion?\nOptions: E. terrible D. afraid C. joy B. going to prison A. vengeance"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As per the question, killing people should not cause an emotion. As per the given options, 'terrible' is the correct option because it indicates the feeling of horror, sorrow, regret or disapproval of the act of killing people. Fear and joy are emotions that are inappropriate or unethical to associate with such a serious act, while going to prison is not a response that can be caused by emotions. Hence, the answer is E. terrible."}]
