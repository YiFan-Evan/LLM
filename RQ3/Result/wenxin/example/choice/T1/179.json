John rode on a plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther, so he must have been on a place with steep walls. Gorges are often found on the coast, where plains and hills end and the sea starts. Mountains, fancies, and cliffs are all types of terrain, but they are not likely to be reached by someone riding on a plain and encountering an ocean barrier. Therefore, the most appropriate option is E. gorge."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther.
