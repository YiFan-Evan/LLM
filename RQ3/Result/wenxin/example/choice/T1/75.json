A folding chair is typically used for seating in a classroom or other indoor areas, but not for storing. It is not suitable for use in a closet or garage, as they are designed for storing items that require more space and protection from the elements. The folding chair is suitable for use on a beach or in a city hall, but it is primarily intended for seating purposes rather than storing.
