[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Premises: [(1) Each zumpus is a jompus and a yumpus.

Therefore, Fae, being a wumpus and nervous, is a numpus. From the premise (3), we know that everything that is blue and a gorpus is a zumpus, which proves that Fae's color is blue. The premise (5) indicates that everything that is floral and a zumpus is a wumpus, which applies to Fae. Fae, being floral, is also a wumpus.

However, the specific combination of these attributes that makes Fae snowy and a wumpus is not explicitly stated in the premises. Therefore, we need to use reasoning and logic to infer this combination based on the information provided.\n\nFrom the premises (5) and (6), we know that everything that is floral and a zumpus is a wumpus and that everything that is snowy and a wumpus is a dumpus. Since Fae is floral and a zumpus, it follows that Fae is a wumpus. Additionally, Fae being snowy is shown by the premise (14). Therefore, Fae is snowy and a wumpus.\n\nSince the premises do not explicitly state all the details of Fae's nature, we have used reasoning and logic to infer the combination of attributes that make Fae snowy and a wumpus. The resulting proof follows from the provided premises and is supported by the reasoning and logic used to infer the conclusion."}]
