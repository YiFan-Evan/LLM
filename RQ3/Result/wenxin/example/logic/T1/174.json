You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

To do this, we need to find a contradiction from the statements above. Based on the premise (7), wumpuses are yumpuses and rompuses, grimpuses, and vumpuses, so Sally cannot be both a dumpus and a wumpus, since dumpuses are shumpuses, not wumpuses (the disjunction between dumpus and wumpus must be true). However, it does not affect the claim about being a numpus since all numpuses are shumpuses and also vumpsus (the disjunction between numpus and vumpus is true). Therefore, we can infer that Sally is not a wumpus from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions to prove (14) Sally is not a wumpus is: [(1) Numpuses are yumpuses, (2) Each dumpus is a shumpus, (3) Sally is a shumpus, (5) Everything that is a grimpus, a gorpus, or a rompus is a vumpus, (7) Wumpuses are yumpuses and rompuses, grimpuses and vumpuses], [4) Everything that is a shumpus or a rompus or a tumpus is a brimpus], and [9) Sally is not a vumpus].
