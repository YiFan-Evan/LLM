Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Prove: Fae is luminous and wooden and liquid and a dumpus.\n\nFrom the premises, we can infer that Fae is small, mean, aggressive, liquid, and amenable. To prove the given proof obligation, we need to show that Fae is also luminous and a dumpus.\n\nTo do so, we can use the following reasoning:\n\n1. From premise 20, we know that Fae is luminous. This establishes the luminous aspect of Fae.\n2. From premise 18, we know that Fae is amenable. From premise 8, we know that everything that is amenable and aggressive is a dumpus. Therefore, Fae is also a dumpus, establishing the dumpish aspect of Fae.\n3. Finally, from premise 4, we know that Fae is liquid. This establishes the liquid aspect of Fae.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Fae is luminous, wooden, liquid, and a dumpus from the given premises and the reasoning above.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions to prove the given proof obligation is: (2), (6), (8), (4), (18), (9), (20), (16), (19), (21).\n\n(Note: I have omitted the second proof obligation because it did not match any of the given premises.)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is wooden.
