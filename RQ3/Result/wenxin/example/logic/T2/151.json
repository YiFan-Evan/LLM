[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Premises: [(1) Each zumpus is a jompus and a yumpus.

Premise (18): Alex is metallic and a jompus.\n2. Premise (1): Everything that is slow and a lorpus is a gorpus.\n3. Since Alex is slow, he is a gorpus by 2.\n4. From the fact that Alex is a gorpus, it follows that he is not a lorpus by definition of lorpus.\n5. From the fact that Alex is not a lorpus, it follows that he is not a brimpus by definition of brimpus.\n6. Premise (5): Everything that is metallic and a jompus is a lorpus.\n7. Since Alex is not a brimpus, he is not a jompus by 5.\n8. Therefore, Alex is not a jompus by the transitivity of \"is metallic and\" in 5 and 6.\n9.
