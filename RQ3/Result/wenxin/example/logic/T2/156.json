You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Since Alex is both moderate and a gorpus, Alex must be a jompus.\n\nFrom the premise (3), we know that \"everything that is moderate and a brimpus is a dumpus\". Since Alex is a jompus and also a brimpus, Alex must be a dumpus.\n\nFrom the premise (4), we know that \"everything that is luminous and a brimpus is a lempus\". Since Alex is not luminous, Alex cannot be a lempus.\n\nFrom the premise (5), we know that \"everything that is bitter and a gorpus is a brimpus\". Since Alex is bitter, Alex must be a brimpus.\n\nFrom the premise (6), we know that \"everything that is mean and an impus is a numpus\". However, Alex is not mean, so he cannot be a numpus.\n\nFrom the premise (7), we know that \"everything that is muffled and a rompus is a lorpus\". However, Alex is not muffled, so he cannot be a lorpus.\n\nFinally, from the premises (9) through (14), we know that Alex is happy, temperate, and an impus.\n\nCombining all of these pieces of information, we can conclude that Alex is a jompus, a dumpus, and a brimpus. Therefore, Alex must also be moderate and a brimpus. Therefore, the proof of \"(16) Alex is moderate and a brimpus\" has been derived from the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions required to prove \"(16) Alex is moderate and a brimpus\" is: (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (9), (10), (12), (13), and (14).
