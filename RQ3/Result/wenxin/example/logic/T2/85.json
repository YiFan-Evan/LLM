[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Premises: [(1) Each zumpus is a jompus and a yumpus.

Everything that is earthy or a gorpus is a jompus.\n2. Everything that is blue or a jompus is a wumpus.\n3. Everything that is nervous or a gorpus is a sterpus.\n4. Everything that is large or a tumpus is a gorpus.\n5. Everything that is moderate or a shumpus is a grimpus.\n6. Everything that is temperate or a tumpus is a brimpus.\n7. Everything that is opaque or a jompus is a rompus.\n8. Fae is a gorpus (known from premise 8).\n9. Fae is a shumpus (known from premise 9).\n\nThe minimal set of premises that prove \"(10) Fae is blue or a jompus\" is:\n\n1-2-9 (1), (2), (3) -> (10)\n\nThe reasoning process:\n\n1. From the first premise, we know that if Fae is earthy or a gorpus, then he/she is a jompus. This rule does not involve Fae's color, so we cannot use it directly to prove the color part of our statement.\n2. The second premise says that if Fae is blue or a jompus, then he/she is a wumpus. If Fae is blue, he/she falls under the color part of our statement, so we can use this rule to prove the color part of our statement.\n3. The third premise gives us information about gorpuses and they are nervous. Fae being a gorpu gives him/her an additional qualification as being nervous. However, this rule does not provide information about color, so we cannot use it directly to prove the color part of our statement.\n4. From the fifth premise, we know that if Fae is moderate or a shumpus, then he/she is a grimpus. Since Fae is already known to be a shumpus (premise 9), we can infer that he/she must be a grimpus and hence must be a grimpus and also be blue (from the second premise).\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises to prove \"(10) Fae is blue or a jompus\" are: (1), (2), (3) and (9). The conclusion follows directly from these premises using deductive reasoning, showing that Fae's being both a grimpus and being blue constitutes either proof of Fae's being blue or that Fae falls within the scope of jompus' being blue category as stated in the premises above."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is a shumpus.
