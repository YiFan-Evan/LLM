You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

From the premise (2), we know that everything that is discordant, melodic, and a yumpus is a vumpus, and Alex is discordant. Therefore, Alex can only be melodic and a yumpus. Finally, from the premise (13), we know that Alex is a yumpus and from the premises (5) and (14), we know that everything that is bitter and sour and a shumpus is a tumpus.
