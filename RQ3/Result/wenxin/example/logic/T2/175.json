[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Premises: [(1) Each zumpus is a jompus and a yumpus.

Since it is stated in premise (24) that dumpuses are brown, dumpuses must be of some color other than brown. Therefore, it can be inferred that she is not a dumpuse, nor is she an impus, as it is stated in premise (6). If Sally is a jompus, she must be a lorpus or a zumpus according to premise (14), and since it is stated in premise (9) that lorpuses are kind, it can be inferred that Sally is not a lorpus. Therefore, Sally cannot be a tumpus, as it is stated in premise (12). Therefore, Sally cannot be a tumpus or a jompus, as it is stated in premise (14).\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises to prove \"(25) Sally is not small\" is: [(2), (6), (9), (12), (14), (23), (24)]. This proves that Sally is not small.\n\nConclusion: \"(25) Sally is not small\" can be derived from the given premises in the form \"(1),(2),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(9),(10),(11),(12),(13),(14),(15),(16),(17),(18),(19),(20),(21),(22),(23),(24)->(25)\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sally is a shumpus.
