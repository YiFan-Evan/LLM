Stella is not a tumpus (from 6).\n\nNow we need to prove (20): \"Stella is blue and red and a jompus.\" We can use the following chain of reasoning to prove this:\n\n16. From 7: Everything that is bright and dull and a rompus is a vumpus, and 13: Stella is sweet, we can infer that Stella is vumpus because she is bright and dull.\n17. From 4: Everything that is cold, hot, and a yumpus is a shumpus, 1: Everything that is fruity and earthy and a shumpus is a dumpus, and 9: Stella is vumpus because she is hot, we can infer that Stella is hot and belongs to the class of dumpuses/wumpuses/vumpuses/sour types.\n18. From 1: Stella belongs to the class of dumpuses/wumpuses/vumpuses/sour types, 2: everything that is muffled and discordant and a shumpus belongs to the class of wumpuses, and 5: everything that is shy, happy, and a dumpus belongs to the class of tumpuses, we can infer that Stella can be both muffled and discordant or shy or happy.\n19. From 8: Everything that is luminous, metallic, and a dumpus is a numpus, 18: Stella can be both muffled and discordant or shy or happy, and 5: everything that is shy, happy, and a dumpus (tumpus) can be red (which corresponds to this blue), we can infer that Stella must be either metallic or light. Since Stella also fits into the class of jompuses based on other conditions related to its being red/blue-based category. Thus it's enough to combine (blue), (red), (jumpus) from 9 (the reason why she fits into this category) to conclude that Stella is blue and red and a jompus, which proves the statement (20).\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions for deriving (20) from the given premises are [(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (7), (8), (9), (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18)].
