Based on the premises, here is a possible derivation of (18):\n\n1. From the premise (1), we know that sour and a wumpus are impus. Since Alex is overcast and a tumpus (premise (10)), Alex is also sour and a wumpus. Therefore, Alex is an impus.\n\n2. From the premise (2), we know that shy and a lorpus is a brimpus. Since Alex is brown and overcast (premise (12)), Alex is also shy and a lorpus. Therefore, Alex is a brimpus.\n\n3. Based on the previous steps, we know that Alex is both an impus and a brimpus. Since Alex is also a dumpus (premise (13)), we can infer that Alex is a trippus (because everything that is both a brimpus and a dumpus is a trippus).\n\n4. Based on the premise (8), we know that everything that is overcast and a dumpus is a rompus. Therefore, since Alex is overcast and a dumpus, Alex is also a rompus.\n\n5. Based on the previous step, we know that Alex is brown, cold, loud, aggressive, and a tumpus (premise (12), (14), (15), (16), and (17)). Therefore, Alex is also opaque and a jompus (premise (9)).\n\n6. Combining the inference from step 4 and the inference from step 5, we can conclude that Alex is brown and a jompus, as stated in the desired conclusion (premise (18)).\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can derive the conclusion (18) Alex is brown and a jompus.
