[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Everything that is rainy or a numpus is a grimpus.\n\n2. Everything that is bright or a jompus is a numpus.\n\n3. Everything that is red or a tumpus is a lempus.\n\n4. Everything that is amenable or a numpus is a lorpus.\n\n5. Sam is a tumpus.\n\n6. Sam is a jompus.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that if Sam is rainy or a numpus, then he is a grimpus. However, we also know from the sixth premise that Sam is a jompus, so he cannot be rainy or a numpus according to the first premise.\n\nMoving on to the second premise, we know that if Sam is bright or a jompus, then he is a numpus. However, we also know from the fifth premise that Sam is already a tumpus, so he cannot be bright or a jompus according to the second premise.\n\nTherefore, Sam cannot be rainy or a numpus based on the first two premises alone.\n\nNow, we need to consider the remaining premises to find out if there are any other conditions that could make Sam rainy or a numpus.\n\nFrom the third premise, we know that if Sam is red or a tumpus, then he is a lempus. However, since Sam is already a tumpus according to the fifth premise, he cannot be red or a tumpus. Therefore, we can conclude that Sam cannot be rainy or a numpus based on the third premise alone.\n\nFinally, from the fourth premise, we know that if Sam is amenable or a numpus, then he is a lorpus. Since Sam is already known to be a jompus (according to the sixth premise), he cannot be amenable or a numpus based on the fourth premise alone.\n\nTherefore, based on all of the given premises, we can conclude that Sam is not rainy or a numpus.\n\nHowever, we still need to prove the statement \"(8) Sam is rainy or a numpus\" because it was the proof obligation given in the question. To do this, we need to introduce additional premises or make some assumptions about Sam's environment or characteristics that could make him rainy or a numpus. Since these are not explicitly stated in the given premises, it would be beyond the scope of this question to provide an answer.
