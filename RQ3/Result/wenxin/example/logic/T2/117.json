[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Premises: [(1) Each zumpus is a jompus and a yumpus.

Therefore, Fae must be liquid and it cannot be transparent or snowy. Also, Fae cannot be sweet or slow because they do not apply to Fae's nature as described in the premises. Since Fae is described as being floral, it follows that Fae cannot be a vumpus, so it must be either a numpus or a yumpus. Since we have already established that Fae is not a zumpus, it follows that Fae must be a numpus or a yumpus but not both. This analysis confirms our original hypothesis that Fae must be snowy and not blue because they conflict with the premise description of Fae's color and state. Finally, from our previous deductions that Fae is either a numpus or yumpus and now known to be snowy, we can infer that Fae must be snowy and a numpus, as required by the proof obligation (18)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is floral.
