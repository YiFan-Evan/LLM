Therefore, since Sam is a wumpus, we can infer that Sam is a gorpu (modus ponens).\n\nFrom premise 1, we know that \"everything that is sweet, sour, and a brimpus is a yumpus\". Since Sam is both sweet and sour, we can infer that he must be a brimpus (given that it is already stated in premise 13). Therefore, we have established that Sam is sweet and sour and a brimpus (modus ponens).\n\nTherefore, the proof obligation (16) can be derived from the given premises (1-15). The minimal set of premise propositions are (2), (3), (6), (8), (9), (10), (11), (13), which are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the proof obligation number (16). The result follows in the form '(2),(3),(6),(8),(9),(10),(11),(13)->(16)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow represent the order of introduction in the proof process, which matches with the derivation process, so the result satisfies the format specified in the question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sam is a shumpus.
