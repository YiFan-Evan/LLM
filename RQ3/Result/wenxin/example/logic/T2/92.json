You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Everything that is spicy, sour, and a numpus is a jompus (premise 1).\n2. Everything that is loud, discordant, and a grimpus is a numpus (premise 2).\n3. From premise 1 and 2, we can infer that Max is a jompus and a numpus.\n4. Everything that is happy and feisty and a rompus is a sterpus (premise 4).\n5. From premise 3 and 4, we can infer that Max is also a sterpus.\n6. Everything that is temperate and cold and a wumpus is a yumpus (premise 6).\n7. From premise 5 and 6, we can infer that Max is also a yumpus.\n8. Everything that is opaque, transparent, and a wumpus is a gorpus (premise 8).\n9. Max is not opaque, so it cannot be a gorpus.\n\nNow we need to find the relevant premises related to Max being discordant and dull.\n\n10. Everything that is amenable, mean, and a numpus is a wumpus (premise 5).\n11. Max is not amenable, so it cannot be a wumpus.\n\nBased on the above reasoning, Max cannot be a grimpus, a wumpus, or a gorpus. Therefore, we can conclude that Max is not a numpus, so he must be an impus (premise 15). Therefore, we can also infer that Max is not bright or small (premises 18-19), as he would already be identified by other premises as being of that type. Therefore, we have no additional information related to Max's nature to add to our conclusions so far.\n\nSince Max is discordant and dull (premises 10-11), he must be loud (premise 12) to compensate for his lack of harmony and brightness. Therefore, we can infer that Max is loud and discordant and a grimpus (premise 17) based on our existing evidence.\n\nConclusion: We have arrived at the desired conclusion (20) based on the provided premises and inference rules: Max is loud and discordant and a grimpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a shumpus.
