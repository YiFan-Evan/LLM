You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Premises: [(1) Each zumpus is a jompus and a yumpus.

However, the given premises do provide information about Alex's physical properties, which could potentially provide additional evidence to support the assertion that Alex is kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus. Specifically, the fact that Alex is wooden, liquid, metallic, and bitter suggests that he may be strong and sturdy, as well as sensitive and emotional. The fact that he is sweet and spicy may indicate that he is passionate and vibrant. Additionally, the fact that Alex is an impus suggests that he is brave and passionate. Based on this evidence, it can be inferred that Alex is kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus.
