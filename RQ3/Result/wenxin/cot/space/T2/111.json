Therefore, after moving around the path 8 steps counter-clockwise and 6 steps clockwise, you will still be within the same distance range of the items on the path, which still includes a toy store. Therefore, moving further clockwise for 3 steps in the direction of the toy store brings you closer to it. As a result, after all of these movements, you will find a toy store."}]
