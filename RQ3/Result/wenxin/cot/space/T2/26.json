After moving clockwise by 5 steps, you found the velvet.\n\nSince there are only 4 items on the path (tiger, velvet, switch, and stopwatch), moving clockwise in a single step will take you to the last item on the path, which is the stopwatch. But since you only moved by 5 steps clockwise, you didn't pass directly to it, so you ended up with the velvet instead. However, as mentioned above, since you already have the velvet after moving clockwise by 5 steps, your final destination should be the tiger, because moving counter-clockwise by 2 steps directly brings you to it.
