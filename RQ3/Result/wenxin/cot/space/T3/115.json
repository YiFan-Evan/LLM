Starting from the mantis, we move clockwise for 6 steps, which takes us to the pomegranate. Then, we move counterclockwise for 8 steps, which takes us to the threshing machine. After that, we move clockwise for another 6 steps, which brings us to the screw. Finally, we move counterclockwise for 2 more steps, which brings us to the paddle wheel.
