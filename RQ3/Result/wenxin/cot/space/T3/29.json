Starting from the tiger, you moved counter-clockwise by 4 steps, which placed you next to the goblet. Then, you moved counter-clockwise by 3 steps, which took you to the weasel. Since the path is circular, this movement took you back to the starting point of the tiger. However, you also mentioned moving clockwise around the path by 5 steps before you moved counter-clockwise. This would take you to the gossamer-winged butterfly again. Since you are still on the circular path, you will need to move clockwise one more time to reach the squid located directly below the butterfly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
