Since these items are located after you on the path, you will encounter them in that order as you move counterclockwise. \n\nHowever, moving counterclockwise by 7 steps will take you to a point directly above the infant bed. At this point, you are directly above the infant bed and also within sight of the damselfly and ostrich. \n\nBased on your description of steps moving counterclockwise by 7 steps and moving clockwise by 2 steps, I can infer that these movements were intentionally done in a way to cover a certain area above and around the infant bed without crossing any items on the path that have already been mentioned. Therefore, the item you will find is the doll located directly above the infant bed."}]
