Moving clockwise from the gown, you will encounter the orange, table lamp, and suspension bridge in that order. Then, moving counterclockwise from the gown, you will encounter the traffic light, computer mouse, green mamba, and trilobite. Finally, moving counterclockwise from the green mamba, you will arrive at the television. Since you start with a trilobite and end up with a television, moving in both directions results in different items.
