The sequence of movements in both directions leads us around the path several times, but at some point, we will come to a point where we have covered exactly one step in each direction, and from there, we will continue to move clockwise. At this point, we will come to the pill bottle located at the position directly opposite to where we started from. Therefore, the final item found on the path is the pill bottle."}]
