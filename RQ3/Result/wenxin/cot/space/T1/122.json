After moving 15 steps, you will encounter a King Charles Spaniel, then a ski mask, a space bar, a magnetic compass, and a spotlight. After these items, you will encounter a confectionery store and a loggerhead sea turtle. Therefore, moving clockwise, you will encounter the loggerhead sea turtle.\n\nNow let's consider the counter-clockwise movement. After moving 15 steps in the counter-clockwise direction, you will encounter a spotlight, a magnetic compass, a space bar, a confectionery store, and a King Charles Spaniel again. Then you will move into the snowmask.

You start off with a King Charles Spaniel and are surrounded by various items on the circular path. Moving clockwise, you will encounter a ski mask, a lorikeet, a pajamas, a magnetic compass, a spotlight, and a confectionery store. Then, moving counter-clockwise, you will encounter a spotlight, a magnetic compass, a loggerhead sea turtle, and finally a space bar.\n\nNow let's consider your movements. You move clockwise by 1 step, which will take you to the ski mask. Then you move counter-clockwise by 1 step, which will take you back to the space bar. Finally, you move clockwise by 15 steps and counter-clockwise by 15 steps. Since these movements are small in comparison to the other movements you made, they will not change your position much. Therefore, you will still be surrounded by the same items as before and the final item you will find is a space bar."}]
