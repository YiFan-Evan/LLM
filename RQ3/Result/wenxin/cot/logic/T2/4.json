Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

From the first premise, we know that everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a jompus. \n2. From the second premise, we know that everything that is a yumpus or an impus is a numpus. \n3. Since Alex is not a jompus, he cannot be a grimpus or a lorpus. This is because the grimpus and the lorpus are included in the category of jompus. Therefore, Alex cannot be a grimpus or a lorpus according to the first premise.\n\nThus, the combination of the first, second, and third premises proves that Alex is not a grimpus and Alex is not a lorpus.
