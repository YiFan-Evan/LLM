Everything that is muffled, melodic, loud, discordant and a wumpus is a zumpus - premise (4)\n4. Therefore, Polly is a zumpus - from 1 and 3\n5. Polly is windy and snowy - premise (12)\n6. Everything that is windy and snowy is a grimpus - premise (5)\n7. Therefore, Polly is a grimpus - from 5 and 6\n8. Polly is also brown and red - from the definition of 'grimpus' given in premise (3)\n9. Polly is also happy and sunny - from the definition of 'gorpus' given in premise (2)\n10. Everything that is blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus is an impus - premise (3)\n11. Therefore, Polly is an impus - from 8-10\n\nFinally, we can conclude that Polly is a grimpus, brown, red, and also blue and orange.
