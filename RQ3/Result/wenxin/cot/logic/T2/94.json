You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Therefore, Max, being a grimpus (premise 6), is either liquid or a vumpus. \n\n4. From the premises, we know that everything that is sour or a tumpus is a gorpus. \n\n5. Since Max is liquid or a vumpus, he is either sour or a tumpus. \n\n6. Since Max is sour or a tumpus, he is either sour or sour and a tumpus. \n\n7.
