From the premises (1), (4), and (7), we know that gorpus is a brimpus and a gorpus is a tumpus, so we can infer that a gorpus is also a yumpus.\n2. From the premise (2), we know that if something is a vumpus or an impus or a brimpus, it is a yumpus. Therefore, since gorpus is a yumpus, it follows that gorpus is a vumpus or an impus or a brimpus.\n3. From the premise (5), we know that if something is a vumpus, it is also a shumpus and a rompus and a lempus.
