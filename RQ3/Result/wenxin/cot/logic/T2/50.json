From (1), we know that a lempus is not a yumpus. From (2), we know that Max is a jompus. From (4), Max is both a zumpus and a shumpus, but not an impus. From (6), we know that a lempus is a gorpus, which can be further proven from (8). From (14), Max is also a shumpus and a numpus.\n\nStep 2: Based on the above information, we can infer that Max is not an impus based on the following reasoning:\n\n1. If Max were an impus, then he would have to be either a tumpus or an impus according to the definition in premise (8). However, from (5) and (12), Max is not only a shumpus but also a vumpus and a dumpus, which are different from tumpus and impus. Therefore, Max cannot be an impus.\n\nStep 3: The above inference establishes that Max cannot be an impus without relying on any other premise statements, thus completing the proof.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that \"Max is not an impus.\" Therefore, the final answer is: (17) Max is not an impus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a tumpus.
