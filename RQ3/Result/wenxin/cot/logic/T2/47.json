Premise (6) states that Alex is nervous.\n2. Premise (12) states that Alex is feisty.\n3. Feistiness and shyness are opposites (as stated in premise (14)). Therefore, it follows that Alex cannot be both feisty and shy at the same time. However, the combination of these two premises implies that Alex is not shy.\n4. Therefore, it can be inferred that Alex is not shy and nervous at the same time.\n5. Based on premise (1), it follows that if something is overcast, windy, rainy, and a lempus, it is a grimpus. Since Alex is overcast, windy, rainy, and a lempus, he is a grimpus.\n6. Since Alex is a grimpus and he is not shy and nervous at the same time, it follows that he is either only feisty or only shy.\n7. Based on premise (16), it follows that Alex is brown. However, since he is also orange (from premise (7)), it follows that he cannot be only brown and must be at least one of the other colors mentioned in the premises.\n8. Therefore, it can be inferred that Alex is either brown or feisty and shyness must be a separate characteristic of Alex's personality.\n9. Since we have determined that Alex is not shy and nervous at the same time, it follows that he must be at least one of the other characteristics mentioned in the premises. Based on premise (8), Alex is feisty, so he cannot be only brown and must be at least one of the other colors mentioned in the premises (orange, blue or green). Therefore, we can infer that Alex's personality includes at least one of these characteristics and does not involve only one color as previously assumed.\n10. From (1) it follows that an item classified as having these properties will be classified as a grimpus (according to premise 2), and it is indeed correctly so classified according to premises 6, 11, and 12, since all these items are classified as a wumpus.\n\nTherefore, from all the premises used in this proof process, we can conclude that Alex is a grimpus with all of the associated characteristics of being overcast, windy, rainy, a lempus; earthy, floral, fruity, a wumpus; brown; orange; blue; and feisty as stated in premises 6 through 15 inclusive and then derived through steps 7 through 10 above.
