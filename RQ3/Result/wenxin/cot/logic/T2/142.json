From the premises (1), (3), and (9), we know that zumpuses are lorpuses.\n2. From the premises (7) and (10), we know that each impus is a lorpus and a tumpus and a grimpus, and that grimpuses are rompuses. Therefore, we can infer that each impus is a tumpus.\n3. From the premises (5), (6), and (8), we know that each impus is a wumpus and that gorpuses are dumpuses. Hence, each impus is also a gorpus.\n4. Since the premises establish that zumpuses are lorpuses and that each impus is both a tumpus and a gorpus, we can infer from (1) that Stella is a zumpus and (2) that each tumpus is a wumpus.\n5. From the premises (11), (2), and (4), we know that Stella is a zumpus, a tumpus, and a jompus, and that each jompus is a zumpus. Therefore, we can infer that Stella is also a jompus.\n6. Finally, from the premises (11), (3), and (8), we know that Stella is a wumpus, Stella is not a lorpus, and Stella is a jompus.
