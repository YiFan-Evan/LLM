Premise (3) states that Sam is a tumpus, and it follows from premise (7) that a tumpus is a gorpus, so Sam is a gorpu.2. The fact that Sam is a yumpus (from premise (5)) and a dumpus (from premise (12)) makes it certain that he is one of the animals specified in the second premise of the second clause, which is that everything that is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus is a sterpus. Therefore, Sam is not an impus.3. Since the first premise of the third clause states that each zumpus is a jompus, and Sam is a zumpus (from premise (11)), it follows that Sam is also a jompus.4. The fourth premise specifies that everything that is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus is not a jompus, so since Sam is both a jompus and a yumpus/rompus/lempus, he cannot be an impus.\n\nTherefore, all of the premises lead to the conclusion that Sam is not an impus.
