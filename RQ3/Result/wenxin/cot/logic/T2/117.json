(17) Fae is slow. Fae is also a vumpus. Therefore, Fae is a gorpus according to (3).\n5. Since Fae meets all the conditions in the given premises, we can conclude that Fae is a wumpus, a tumpus, a gorpus, liquid, snowy, and blue.\n\nNow we need to prove that Fae is also snowy and a wumpus based on the condition (6).\n\n6. (6) Everything that is snowy and a wumpus is a dumpus. Since Fae is both snowy and a wumpus, she must be a dumpus according to (6). However, we are trying to prove (18), which says that Fae is snowy and a wumpus. Therefore, we need to prove that Fae is not a dumpus.\n\n7. To prove that Fae is not a dumpus, we need to find a contradiction between the condition (6) and the fact that Fae is already a dumpus. However, this does not exist because dumpus does not exist in the premises. Therefore, Fae cannot be a dumpus.\n\n8. Since we have shown that Fae cannot be a dumpus and she is already proven to be a wumpus, tumpus, gorpus, liquid, and snowy based on the given premises, it follows that Fae must be snowy and a wumpus based on the condition (6).
