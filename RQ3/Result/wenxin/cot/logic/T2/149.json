From the premise (1) and (5), we know that each zumpus is a wumpus. From the premise (6), we know that zumpuses are dumpuses. Therefore, Sam, a vumpus, is also a zumpus.\n\n2. From the premise (2), we know that brimpuses are slow. Since Sam is a brimpus, he is slow.\n\n3. From the premise (7), we know that every yumpus is a brimpus, so Sam, as a yumpus, is also a brimpus.\n\n4. From the premise (3), we know that every gorpus is not melodic. Therefore, because Sam is a gorpus, he cannot be melodic.\n\n5. The fact that Sam is both slow and not melodic indicates that he must be an interesting person, hence, the inference of Sam being overcast (due to its being associated with mysterious or interesting people).\n\n6. Since we have proved that Sam is overcast in steps 2 through 5, it follows that he is overcast based on his own specific characteristics (i.e., being a zumpus, brimpus, slow and not melodic).
