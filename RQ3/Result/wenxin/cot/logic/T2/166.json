Everything that is orange and a gorpus is a yumpus. (Premise 4)\n\nGiven these two premises, we can infer that Stella is orange and a gorpus. Since orange and a gorpus are specified in premise 4, we can infer that Stella is orange.\n\n3. Stella is orange and a gorpus. (From 4 and 7)\n\nFrom the premises, we also know that Stella is mean and a numpus if it is mean and a numpus, it is a zumpus. (Premise 3)\n\n4. Stella is mean and a gorpus. (From 3 and 3)\n\n5. Stella is a zumpus. (From 3, 4, and inference: conjunction)\n\n6. Stella is also a wumpus (from premise 12).\n\nNow, since Stella is both a zumpus and a wumpus, she must be slow according to the premise (2). Therefore, Stella is slow and a numpus.\n\n7.
