Start by noting that the given premises involve a variety of different animals and characteristics.\n2. The proof obligation asks us to show that Sam is a gorpus, which means we need to use the given premises to show that Sam has all the characteristics of a gorpus.\n3. Based on the premises, we know that a gorpus is large and sour, like a dumpus, but also floral like a wumpus or yumpus. Sam has these characteristics already.\n4. To complete the proof, we need to identify how Sam can be classified as a gorpus without adding any new information from the premises. We need to look at the definition of a gorpus and compare it to what Sam has already been shown to have.\n5. Based on the given premises, we know that a gorpus is also opaque and vumpus like a shumpus or wumpus, but these characteristics are already covered by Sam's existing attributes.\n6.
