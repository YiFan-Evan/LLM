Furthermore, we know from (22) that lorpuses are not cold, and since every lorpus is a numpus, and every numpus is a grimpus, we can infer that Max is also a grimpus. We also know from (2) that shumpuses are not opaque, and from (3) that each vumpus is orange, so Max cannot be opaque or vumpus. Finally, from (1) we know that every tumpus is a lorpus, and from (13) that each tumpus is a shumpus, we can infer that Max is a lorpus.\n\nNow, we need to use these facts to prove that Max is not cold. Since Max is both earthy and slow, and since earthy creatures are typically warm, we can infer that Max is warm. Since Max is also a grimpus, which is known to be spicy, we can infer that Max is also spicy.
