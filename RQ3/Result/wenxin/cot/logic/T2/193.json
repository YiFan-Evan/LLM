However, we still need to show that Rex is not feisty according to the given proof obligation.\n\nTo prove this, we need to find a combination of premises that leads to the conclusion that Rex is not feisty while maintaining the premises as consistent as possible. Since Rex is already shown to be aggressive, we can use the premise that vumpuses are not large (from the seventh premise) and the premise that numpuses are not dull (from the eighteenth premise) to show that Rex is not a large or dull animal, which in turn means that Rex is not considered fierce or threatening by most standards.\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer is: \"Therefore, (25) Rex is not feisty.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a dumpus.
