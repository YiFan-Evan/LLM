From the first premise, we know that anything that is both floral and a numpus is a wumpus.\n2. From the second premise, we know that anything that is metallic and a gorpus is a vumpus.\n3. Since Max is a small numpus (from premise 5), and according to the definitions of both a gorpus and a numpus, we can infer that Max is also a small gorpus.\n4. Combining this with the third premise, we know that everything that is small and a gorpus is a sterpus. Therefore, Max is also a sterpus.\n\nHowever, since we already know from the fourth premise that Max is small, the final statement Max is small and a gorpus follows directly from the premises without further proof.\n\nSo, the minimal set of premise propositions that proves \"(7) Max is small and a gorpus\" is: [(1), (2), (3), (5), (6)]->(7)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a gorpus.
