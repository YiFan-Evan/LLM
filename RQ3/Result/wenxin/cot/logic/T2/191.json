Use the third premise to prove that everything that is a grimpus or a wumpus or an impus is a shumpus.\n4. From the sixth premise, we know that vumpuses are zumpuses, grimpuses, and lempuses.

Finally, use the eighth premise to prove that Alex is a yumpus, which concludes the proof obligation.\n\nSo far, we have successfully derived the conclusion Alex is a yumpus from the given premises and used intermediate steps to verify the validity of the process.
