[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

From the premises, we know that each zumpus is a vumpus and each brimpus is a wumpus. Therefore, from (6), Max is a zumpus and a dumpus and a lorpus.\n2. From the premises, we know that every zumpus is a yumpus. Therefore, from (5), Max is a yumpus.\n3. From (1) and (2), we know that each zumpus is a vumpus and each brimpus is a dumpus. Therefore, Max is also a dumpus.\n4. From (3), we know that dumpuses are numpuses. Therefore, Max is also a numpus.\n5. From (4), we know that gorpuses are jompuses.
