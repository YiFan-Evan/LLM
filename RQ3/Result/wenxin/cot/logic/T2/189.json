From this we can infer that Alex is not a numpus, which conflicts with premise 23.\n\nSince the conclusion derived from the premises does not fit with the given proof obligation, we must add further premises to support our conclusion. We notice that every impus is not snowy (premise 7) and that Alex is an impus (premise 18). This allows us to infer that Alex is not a snowy impus.\n\nWe continue by noting that sterpuses are shumpuses (premise 1), shumpuses are not angry (premise 8), and Alex is a shumpus (premise 24). Therefore, Alex is not angry.\n\nLastly, we take into account that lorpuses are not dull (premise 20) and that Alex is an Alex is an object of our consideration, as he is a tumpus (premise 22). This allows us to infer that Alex is not a dull lorpus.\n\nCombining all these premises, we can conclude that Alex is not a snowy impus, nor an angry shumpus, nor a dull lorpus.
