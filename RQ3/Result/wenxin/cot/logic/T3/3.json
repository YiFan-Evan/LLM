[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

From the premises, we know that everything that is a vumpus or a lorpus is a tumpus or a dumpus. Therefore, if Max is not a dumpus, then he cannot be a vumpus or a lorpus.\n2. From the premise (4), we know that Max is not a dumpus. Therefore, Max cannot be a vumpus or a lorpus, because they are subsets of the dumpus category.\n3.
