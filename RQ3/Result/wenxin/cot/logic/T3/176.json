Additionally, we know that each impus is a wumpus (Premium 2) and that each dumpus is a wumpus (Premium 8), so Sally being a wumpus follows from these two premises as well.\n\nNow, since Sally is both a wumpus and a vumpus (Premium 1), we can use the fact that each vumpus is a tumpus or a dumpus (Premium 5) to infer that Sally is also a tumpus or a dumpus. Since we already know that she is both a wumpus and a tumpus or a dumpus, we can further infer that she must be a lempus, a tumpus, or a grimpus based on the fact that each impus, dumpus, lorpus, or shumpus is either a tumpus or a grimpus (Premium 3).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Sally is a lempus, a tumpus, or a grimpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is a lempus, a tumpus, or a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.
