From the premises, we know that if Wren is not a zumpus and Wren is not a lorpus, then Taylor is a visionary. This can be expressed as follows: \"Taylor is a visionary\" -> \"(not Wren is a zumpus) and (not Wren is a lorpus)\".\n2. Since Wren is not a brimpus (premise 5), it follows that Wren is not a sterpus or a shumpus (premise 3 and 4).\n3.
