The premise states that Alex is kind, large, and amenable. We then know that kind, large, and a lempus is a tumpus. This conclusion leads to the premise that everything that is small, large, and a dumpus is a gorpus. This can be combined with Alex being amenable and a lempus to show that Alex is also a dumpus. However, since Alex is transparent and we already know he is large and amenable, it cannot be deduced from any other premise that Alex is small as well.
