From the information provided in the premises, we know that Sally is a grimpus, a numpus, and a grimpus that is not a rompus. Since Rompuses are dull, we know that any animal that is not a rompus is not dull. Therefore, Sally cannot be dull.\n\n3. We can now discard premise (2), as it no longer applies to Sally. We can also discard premise (3), as it contradicts our previous inference about the nature of grimpuses.\n\n4. Since Sally is not a grimpus, she cannot be a numpus or a dumpuse, nor can she be large or fast like grimpuses. Therefore, she cannot be a Grimpuse, Jompuse, or Dumpuse based on our inference in Step 1. Since Grumpuses and Jumpuses are derived from one another through premise (3), it also means Sally cannot be a Jompuse either. Based on these facts, Sally cannot be a numpus or a dumpuse, nor can she be a numpus derived from dumpuses through premise (14).\n\n5. Since Sally is not a numpus or a dumpuse, she cannot be described as either being large or being windy, nor can she be sweet, given premise (11). We have thus inferred that Sally's animal category cannot account for any of the information in the premises or their deductions, which rules out her being a Sterpuse as well.\n\n6. Therefore, the only remaining possibility for Sally is that she is a yumpus, which is derived from grimpuses through premise (4). However, since grimpuses are already accounted for in our deductions as being large and fast, it follows that Sally cannot be a yumpus either.\n\n7. Therefore, we conclude that Sally cannot be any of the animals mentioned in the premises or their deductions, which leaves us with no other option but to conclude that Sally is not dull at all.\n\nTherefore, we must discard the proof obligation of (17), as it does not follow from the given premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is dull then Taylor is a visionary.
