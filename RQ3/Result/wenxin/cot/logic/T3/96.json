Then, we can use this to infer that Fae is either a wumpus or a zumpus.\n\nFrom premise (19), we know that Fae is a zumpus. Combining this with the inference from (12), we can conclude that Fae is either a small zumpus or a large zumpus.\n\nFrom premise (21), we know that Fae is wooden. Combining this with the inference from (19), we can conclude that Fae is either a wooden zumpus or a wooden dumpus.\n\nFrom premise (20), we know that Fae is luminous. Combining this with the inference from (21), we can conclude that Fae is either a luminous zumpus or a luminous dumpus.\n\nFinally, from premise (18), we know that Fae is amenable.
