First, we use the premise (21) Every dumpus is a lempus, combined with (1) if Sam is not bitter then Taylor is a visionary. Since Sam is a zumpus (from (24)), we can infer that Taylor is a dumpus.\n2. Then, from (2) Every zumpus is a dumpus and (25) Each zumpus is a tumpus, we infer that Taylor is also a tumpus.\n3.
