We start with premises 1-6 which say that Wren is bright, dull, slow, fast, shy, and nervous. Therefore, from this set of premises we can infer that Wren has at least two attributes. Since Wren is mentioned twice (i.e., grimpus and gorpus), we can infer that it is also an impus.\n\n7-12. The next set of premises gives us more information about Wren, which confirms our previous inference. These premises indicate that Wren is also dull, slow, shy, and nervous. However, we already have information about Wren being an impus and have deduced that it also has other qualities from the premises that make it different from a grimpus or a gorpus. Therefore, these facts are not sufficient to rule out the impus nature of Wren.\n\nTherefore, in order to prove that Wren is both slow and fast and an impus, we need to use the remaining premises.\n\n13-14.
