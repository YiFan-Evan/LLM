Therefore, Tumpuses are numpuses or grimpuses.\n3. From 1 and 2, we can infer that Tumpuses are either lempuses, impuses, or grimpuses.\n4. Premise (9) and (11): Yumpuses are numpuses and Stella is a yumpus and a wumpus. Therefore, Stella is a numpus.\n5. From 3 and 4, we can infer that Stella is either a lempus, an impus, or a grimpus and since she is also a rompus (from premise (10)), she can't be an impus or a grimpus. Therefore, she must be a lempus or a rompus.\n6. From 5 and the fact that tumpuses are either lempuses or rompuses, we can infer that Stella is a rompus.\n7. Finally, since Stella is both a rompus and a numpus (from above), she must also be an impus.\n\nCombining 5, 6, and 7, we get that Stella is a rompus, an impus, or a grimpus.
