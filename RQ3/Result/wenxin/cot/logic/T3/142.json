Start by noting that from the first proposition, we know that Stella is a zumpus.\n2. Then, using the third and ninth propositions, we know that each sterpus is a wumpus and that zumpuses are lorpuses. Therefore, Stella is a wumpus and a lumpus.\n3. From the sixth proposition, we know that gorpuses are dumpuses, so Stella cannot be a gorpus because she is also a dumpus.\n4.

Therefore, Stella is also a jompus and a lumpus.\n\nTherefore, we have established that Stella is a zumpus, a jompus, and a lumpus, but cannot be a gorpus.
