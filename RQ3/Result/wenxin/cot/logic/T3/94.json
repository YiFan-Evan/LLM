From the premises (1) and (4), we know that everything that is liquid or a vumpus is a gorpus. Therefore, Max, who is a vumpus, is a gorpus.\n2. From the premises (2) and (5), we know that everything that is dull or a grimpus is a tumpus. Therefore, Max, who is a grimpus, is a tumpus.\n3. By inference, from premises (3), (6), and (7), we can draw the conclusion that every impus has the quality of sourness or tumpusness.
