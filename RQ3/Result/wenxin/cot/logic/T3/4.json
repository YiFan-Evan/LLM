To do so, we start by considering the third premise, which states that everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a numpus. This proposition allows us to rule out that Alex is a numpus, given the fourth premise. Next, we consider the first premise, which says that everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a jompus. Since Alex is not a numpus, we can safely conclude that he cannot be a jompus, either. Finally, since we already ruled out that Alex is a jompus or a numpus (i.e., he is neither a grimpus nor a lorpus), our answer proves the desired result.
