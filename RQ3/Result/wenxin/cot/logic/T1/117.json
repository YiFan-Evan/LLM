Premise (16): Fae is hot.\n2. Premise (17): Fae is floral.\n3. From (1) and (2), we know that Fae is floral and a wumpus. Therefore, Fae is a sterpus and a wumpus.\n4. From (4), we know that everything that is slow and a vumpus is a gorpus. Therefore, Fae is a slow vumpus.\n5. From (6), we know that everything that is snowy and a wumpus is a dumpus. Therefore, Fae is snowy.\n6. We now have established that Fae is snowy, a wumpus, and a sterpus or vumpus. The combination of these characteristics uniquely identifies a sterpyswumpus or vumpyswampus, which is a subclass of the more general class of snowy wumpuses.\n7.
