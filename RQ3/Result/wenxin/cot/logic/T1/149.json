From the premise (1) and (5), we know that each zumpus is a wumpus. Since Sam is a vumpus, it follows that Sam is also a zumpus.\n2. From the premise (8), we know that every yumpus is a brimpus. Since Sam is a zumpus and brimpuses are slow, we know that Sam is slow.\n3. From the premise (2), we know that brimpuses are slow. From the previous step, we know that Sam is a brimpus and is slow, so Sam is a brimpus and slow.\n4. From the premise (6), we know that zumpuses are dumpuses. Since Sam is a zumpus and dumpuses are nervous, we know that Sam is nervous.\n5. Finally, from the premises (12) and (3), we know that overcast vumpuses are not melodic. Since Sam is a vumpus and overcast, we know that Sam is not melodic.\n\nFrom these steps, we can conclude that Sam is overcast because he is overcast vumpus and not melodic.
