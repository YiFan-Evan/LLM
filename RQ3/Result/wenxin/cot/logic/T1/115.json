Therefore, Sally, as a rompus, must also be a dumpus, a yumpus, and a sterpus.\n\n2.

Therefore, Sally, as a tumpus, must also be discordant and floral and fruity.\n\n3. From the premises (7) and (8), we know that jompuses are transparent and opaque and brimpuses and vumpuses. Sally, as a jompus, must be transparent or opaque.\n\n4. Since Sally is discordant and melodic (presupposition (4)), it cannot be transparent (presupposition (7)), therefore Sally is opaque.\n\n5. Based on the previous conclusion that Sally is opaque, she must be brimpus or vumpus (from the premise (7)). However, if Sally is vumpus, then she cannot be a wumpus or lempus (since a wumpus is an animal and a lempus is located on a moon), therefore Sally must be brimpus.\n\n6. Since Sally is a brimpus, she must also be discordant and melodic (from the premise (8)).\n\n7. Finally, based on the premises (3) and (6), we know that every lorpus is temperate, hot, a dumpus, and a wumpus.
