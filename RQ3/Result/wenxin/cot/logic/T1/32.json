Using the first premise and the ninth premise, we can infer that a gorpus is a rompus.\n2. From the first and the second premises, we know that every rompus is a grimpus and every yumpus is a dumpus. Therefore, we can infer that every yumpus is a grimpus.\n3. From the third premise, we know that rompuses are large. Therefore, we can infer that a grimpus is large.\n4. From the fourth premise, we know that each vumpus is brown. Then, from the sixth and seventh premises, we know that vumpuses are zumpuses and zumpuses are yumpuses. Therefore, we can infer that each zumpus is brown.\n5. From the fifth and tenth premises, we know that each numpus is not transparent and each lempus is not brown. Therefore, we can infer that a numpus is transparent and a lempus is not moderate.\n6. From the last three premises, we know that each grimpus is a brimpuse, zumpuses are brimpuses, and grimpuses are bitter. Therefore, we can infer that brimpuses are bitter.\n7.
