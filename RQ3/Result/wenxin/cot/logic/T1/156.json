You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Alex is mean and an impus, which implies that Alex is a numpus.2. Everything that is moderate and a brimpus is a dumpus. Therefore, Alex is a dumpus by virtue of being moderate.3. From premises (8), (12), and (14), we know that Alex is temperate, happy, and a gorpus, respectively. Since Alex is a dumpus and temperate, he must also be happy and a gorpus.4. From premises (5) and (9), we know that everything that is bitter and a gorpus is a brimpus, and everything that is mean and an impus is a brimpus. Therefore, Alex is a brimpus by virtue of being bitter.5. Since Alex is a brimpus, he must also be a gorpus by virtue of being happy.6. From premises (3) and (4), we know that everything that is moderate and a brimpus is a lempus. Therefore, Alex is a lempus by virtue of being moderate.7. Since Alex is a lempus and a brimpus, he must also be a dumpus by virtue of being a numpus.8. Since Alex is a dumpus, he must also be muffled by virtue of being temperate.9. From premises (7), we know that everything that is muffled and a rompus is a lorpus. Therefore, Alex is a lorpus by virtue of being muffled.\n\nWith these conclusions, we can now use them to prove the desired conclusion: Alex is moderate and a brimpus.
