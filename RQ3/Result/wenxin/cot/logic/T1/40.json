Start by noting that the premises provide information about several types of creatures, including Lempuses, Wumpuses, Shumpuses, Brimpuses, Impuses, and Vumpuses.\n2. The proof obligation asks us to prove that Sally is not a Shumpus. Therefore, we need to focus on the Shumpuses mentioned in the premises.\n3. From the premise \"(4) Every shumpus is a brimpus and an impus and a wumpus\", we know that Sally is a brimpus.\n4. From the premise \"(7) Brimpuses are lempuses\", we know that Sally is also a Lempuse.\n5. The next step is to draw a connection between Lempuses and Shumpuses. However, from the premise \"(3) Shumpuses are gorpuses\", we have no direct connection to draw between the two species. Therefore, we can infer that the genus or species between Lempuses and Shumpuses is not relevant to our current question of whether Sally is a Shumpus.\n6. Then we consider other premises that involve Impuses and Vumpuses. However, these species are not relevant to our current question of whether Sally is a Shumpus.\n7. Finally, we conclude that Sally cannot be a Shumpus because she is already a brimpus and a Lempuse, which are not considered Shumpuses according to the given premises.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions that proves the proof obligation is:\n\n[(1), (2), (7), (8), (9), (10)] -> (11) Sally is not a shumpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
