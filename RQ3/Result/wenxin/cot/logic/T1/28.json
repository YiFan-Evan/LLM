Then, from the fourth proposition, we know that every grimpus is a vumpus. Since Lorpuses are numpuses and every grimpus is a vumpus, Lorpuses are vumps.\n\nStep 2: From the fifth proposition, we know that numpuses are grimpuses, and Lorpuses are vumps. Therefore, numpuses are vumpuses that are not Lorpuses.\n\nStep 3: From the first seven propositions, we know that Brimpuses are lorpuses and that Brimpuses are not fruity. Since numpuses are vumpuses that are not Lorpuses and we know that numpuses are grimpuses, we can infer that numpuses are grimpuses that are not Brimpuses.\n\nStep 4: From the first 18 propositions, we know that every grimpus is a zumpus and that every zumpus is transparent.
