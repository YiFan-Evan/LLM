Start with the given premises.\n2. Apply the definitions and relationships between the objects in the premises to determine their properties.\n3. Use the properties of Wren and its relationships to other objects to determine its classification.\n\nFrom the premises, we know that:\n\n* Vumpuses are opaque and lempuses.\n* Each grimpus is feisty and a shumpus and a rompus.\n* Lempuses are spicy and brimpuses and grimpuses.\n* Wren is opaque and a lempus and a grimpus.\n\nBased on these premises, we can infer that Wren is a lempus or a grimpus, which is opaque.\n\nFrom the definition of lempus, we know that lempuses are spicy. If Wren is a spicy, then it is likely to be classified as a brimpus, as this type is mentioned in the third premise as having characteristics of brimpuses and yumpuses. Therefore, it is a brimpus based on its color (blue) and properties.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises and our reasoning process, we can conclude that Wren is a brimpus.\n\nThe final proof, in the form '(1), (2), (3) -> (11)' is: \"We have defined that Vumpuses are opaque and lempuses, grimpuses are feisty, and each wumpus is sunny, so Wren is both spicy and sunny.
