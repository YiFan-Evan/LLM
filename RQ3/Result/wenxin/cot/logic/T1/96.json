Then, we use this to introduce premise (18), which states that Fae is a zumpus. Combining these two premises, we can infer that Fae is small and liquid.\n\nNext, we use premise (17) to introduce the additional information that Fae is liquid.\n\nNow, we use premise (16) to introduce the additional information that Fae is a wumpus. Then, we combine this with the information derived from the previous steps to infer that Fae is small, liquid, and a wumpus.\n\nFinally, we use premise (20) to introduce the additional information that Fae is luminous and combine it with the information derived from the previous steps to infer that Fae is luminous, liquid, small, and a wumpus.\n\nFrom these premises, we can see that Fae satisfies all of the properties required in the proof obligation (22), which states that Fae is luminous and wooden and liquid and a dumpus.
