From the premises (1), (3), and (9), we know that zumpuses are lorpuses.\n2. From the premises (7) and (10), we know that each impus is a lorpus and a tumpus and a grimpus, and that grimpuses are rompuses.\n3. From the premises (8) and (12), we know that Stella is a sterpus, Stella is not a lorpus, and Stella is a jompus.\n4.

From the premises (1), (3), and (5), we know that each sterpus is a wumpus.\n7. Combining the above steps, we can conclude that Stella is both a tumpus and a wumpus.\n8. However, from the premises (12) and the definition of jompuses, we know that Stella is not a jompus.\n9. Therefore, Stella cannot be a zumpus, because she cannot be both a tumpus and a jompus if she is also a zumpus.\n10.
