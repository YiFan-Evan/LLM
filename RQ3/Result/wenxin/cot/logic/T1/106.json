You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

From the premise (1), we know that each impus is a lorpus.\n2. From the premise (2), we know that everything that is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus is a sterpus. Since Sam is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus, he is a sterpus.\n3. From the premise (4), we know that everything that is a yumpus, a rompus, and a lempus is not a jompus. Therefore, Sam cannot be a jompus.\n4. From the premise (14), we know that Sam is a yumpus. From the premises (5) and (7), we know that Sam is also a gorpus and a tumpus. From the premise (6), we know that everything that is a tumpus and a yumpus and a dumpus is a zumpus. Therefore, Sam is a zumpus by the conjunction of these premises.\n5. The last premises to verify are the premises (8) and (9). The premise (8) states that Grimpuses are dumpuses, but in this case, Sam is already being identified as a zumpus and dumpus. The premise (9) says that each zumpus is a jompus, which cannot apply to Sam as he has already been identified as a sterpus from the previous steps.\n\nBased on these premises and proofs, Sam cannot be an impus because he has already been identified as a yumpus, gorpus, zumpus, and dumpus, none of which are impuses.
