We start by taking the proposition (1) Everything that is spicy, sour, or a numpus is a tumpus and the proposition (2) Everything that is orange, red, or a brimpus is a zumpus. This gives us that brimpus (Max) is a zumpus. Then we use the proposition (3) Everything that is opaque, transparent, or a yumpus is a grimpus to conclude that Max is also a grimpus. The next step is to use the proposition (6) Everything that is earthy or fruity or a vumpus is a numpus to conclude that Max is also a numpus. Finally, we use the proposition (10) Everything that is nervous, shy, or a yumpus is a vumpus and the previous result to conclude that Max is also earthy, fruity or a vumpus. Therefore, Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus.\n\nWe must be careful to follow the order of introduction of the premises and to use only those propositions that are directly related to our proof obligation. In this case, we start with the premise that Max is a brimpus and use it to infer that he is also a zumpus and a grimpus.
