You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Premise (6): Max is a tumpus. This tells us that Max is a member of the class of things that are either brown, blue, or a tumpus.\n\n2. Premise (3): Everything that is moderate, fast, or a tumpus is a lorpus. Therefore, since Max is a tumpus, he must also be a lorpus.\n\n3. However, the additional information provided in the next premise about Max being a sterpus doesn't conflict with our current knowledge that he is a lorpus. It seems to add more detail to our understanding of him.\n\n4. Next, we look at the conclusion that we need to prove: Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus.\n\n5. Now that we have seen that Max is both a tumpus and a lorpus, it's not unreasonable to conclude that he might also be luminous or wooden or any combination thereof, if they belong to the same class as the tumpus and lorpus classes.\n\nTherefore, based on the premises given, we can conclude that \"Max is luminous or wooden or a lorpus\" because he is a tumpus and a lorpus, both of which belong to the same class as being luminous or wooden.
