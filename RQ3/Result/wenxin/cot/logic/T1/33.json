Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Therefore, we can infer that Wren is also a type of gorpu.\n\n**Step 2**: Then, we need to prove that Wren is a type of gorpus. To do so, we need to find a premise that directly proves this statement. From the list of premises, we can see that (14) states that Wren is a tumpus, a yumpus, a zumpus, or a sterpus. Since tumpus, yumpus, zumpus, and sterpus are all types of gorpus (as stated in the premises), we can infer that Wren is also a type of gorpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nProve: (16) Wren is a gorpus.\n\nThis conclusion follows directly from the premises and the reasoning above."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
