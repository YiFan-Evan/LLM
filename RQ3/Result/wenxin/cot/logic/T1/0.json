Use the first premise to infer that if something is happy and a grimpus, then it is a dumpus.\n2. Use the second premise to infer that if something is overcast and a tumpus, then it is a zumpus.\n3. Use the third premise to infer that if something is large and a tumpus, then it is a shumpus.\n4. Apply the fourth premise to Max, which states that Max is a tumpus. Therefore, Max is a shumpus or a zumpus or both.\n5. Apply the fifth premise to Max, which states that Max is overcast. Therefore, Max is a dumpus or a zumpus or both.\n6. Based on the above conclusions, Max must be both a shumpus and a dumpus because everything that is overcast and a tumpus is a zumpus (premise 2). However, since we know from our first inference (premise 1) that everything that is happy and a grimpus is a dumpus, we can also infer that Max is also a dumpus. Therefore, Max is a shumpus, a dumpus, and a zumpus.\n7.
