From the premises, we know that every rompus is a tumpus and every gorpus is a brimpus. Therefore, Sam, being a gorpus, is a brimpus and a tumpus.\n2. From the premise that every grimpus is a brimpus and the fact that Sam is a brimpus, we can infer that Sam is either a grimpus or a wumpus or a vumpus.\n3. However, since the premise that Sam is not a lempus (i.e., a vumpus) has been given, Sam cannot be a vumpus.\n\nCombining these two lines of reasoning, we can conclude that Sam cannot be a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, we have established that the final answer is Sam is not a vumpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
