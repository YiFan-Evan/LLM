Max is both dull and a zumpus, so he must be a yumpus or grimpus, as there are no other creatures in the premises with these characteristics.\n\nSecondly, we take the premise (4) that Max is dull. If Max is dull, then he is either a yumpus or grimpus according to the previous step. Since he is also a zumpus, he must be a grimpus.\n\nFinally, we combine the previous two steps to prove that Max is both dull and a zumpus.
