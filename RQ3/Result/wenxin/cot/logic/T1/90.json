You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Alex is a wumpus and a tumpus, from premise (1).\n2. Alex is also a numpus and a vumpus, from premise (6).\n3. Based on (1) and (2), Alex is windy and sunny, and hence it is a wumpus, a tumpus, and a numpus.\n4. Alex is also wooden and metallic, from premise (3).\n5. Based on (3) and (4), Alex is floral, fruity, and hence it is a brimpus.\n6. From (5) and (7), Alex is temperate and cold, and hence it is a brimpus and a lempus.\n7. From (8), Alex is sweet and sour, which means it is a numpus and a vumpus.\n8. Since we already know that Alex is a wumpus, tumpus, numpus, vumpus, and brimpus from above, it can be concluded that Alex is also an impus from (5), as impuses are one of the five types of wumpuses.\n9.
