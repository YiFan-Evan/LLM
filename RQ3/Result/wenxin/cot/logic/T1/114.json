However, we need to prove that Sam is not a tumpus.\n\nFrom the premise (3), we know that gorpuses are shumpuses. Then from the premise (13), we know that Sam is a vumpus and a sterpus and a lempus. Since the gorpuses are shumpuses and Sam is a gorpus, Sam is also a shumpus. Therefore, the first premise (1) can be used as an intermediate conclusion.\n\nFrom the premise (8), we know that everything that is a tumpus, a yumpus, and a rompus is a wumpus. Since Sam is already a wumpus and also a tumpus, we can infer that Sam is not a yumpus or a rompus.\n\nFrom the premise (14), we know that Sam is a rompus.
