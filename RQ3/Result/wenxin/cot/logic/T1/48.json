Since Sam is a jompus, it follows from (8) that Sam is a wumpus.\n2. Sam is windy and transparent from (9), (11), and (14).\n3. Sam is red and brown and a brimpus from (5) and (13).\n4. From (1), (2), and (3), we know that a wumpus, a shumpus, and a gorpus are all yumpus types. Therefore, Sam, being a wumpus, is also a yumpus.\n5. From the premises about shumpus types, we know that a vumpus is opaque and transparent. Since Sam is transparent, he cannot be a vumpus.\n6. Since Sam is not a vumpus, he must be a shumpus, which is further supported by (4).\n7. Combining (2) and (4), we know that a shumpus is also a gorpus. Therefore, Sam is also a gorpus.\n8.
