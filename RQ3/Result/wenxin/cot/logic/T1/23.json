Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

The first premise tells us that aggressive and grimpus are impus, so Fae must be an impus. Therefore, we can infer that Fae is a grimpus. Now that we know Fae is a grimpus and temperate, the third premise tells us that both temperate and grimpus is a shumpus, which implies that Fae must also be a shumpus.
