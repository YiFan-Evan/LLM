To substitute 'x=4', we need to evaluate the indefinite integral with x=4 and add the constant C. The result will be sin(4) + C.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral, we can use the derivative of cos(x) with respect to x, which is sin(x). Multiply this by x and add it to a constant C, which we will choose to be 0 for simplicity. The indefinite integral becomes sin(x) + C.\n\nNow, substituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get sin(4) + C. Since we don't know the value of C, we can't provide a final answer yet.\n\nTo find the value of C, we need to solve for it in the equation sin(4) + C = some_number. We can do this by setting up an equation and solving for C using a calculator or a computer program.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: sin(4).\n\nNote: sin(4) is approximately -0.965735, so the final result will be -0.965735 rounded down to an integer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77\uff0c\u6211\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u56de\u7b54\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570 cos(x)\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u662f -sin(x) + C\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dC\u662f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5f53x=4\u65f6\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u4e3a -sin(4) + C\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u6c42\u89e3C\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u77e5\u9053C\u7684\u786e\u5207\u503c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u7684C\u503c\u6765\u627e\u5230\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684\u503c\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c1d\u8bd5C=0\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u4e3a -sin(4)\u3002\u8fd9\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4e0e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u76f4\u89c9\u76f8\u7b26\uff0c\u5373cos(x)\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u5e38\u6570\u9879\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6211\u4eec\u63a5\u53d7C=0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u5c31\u662f -sin(4)\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e0d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u56db\u820d\u4e94\u5165\u7684\u6574\u6570\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a-sin(4)\u3002"}]
