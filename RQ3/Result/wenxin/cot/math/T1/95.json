Now, let's substitute 'x=4' into this expression:\n\n\u222be^4dx = e^4 + C\n\nHow do we calculate the constant C?\n\nSince the sin(x) function doesn't appear in the expression anymore, we can take the value of the function at x=4, which is e^4. This value will cancel out in the expression and we will only have to add it back after the integration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: e^4 + C = e^4 + \u222be^4dx\n\nThe indefinite integral \u222be^4dx can be calculated by integrating e^4 from 0 to 4 using the trapezoidal rule, which will give us approximately 17.6767. Therefore, the final answer is: e^4 + 17.6767 = 25.6767\n\nSince we need to round down to an integer, we get: Therefore, the final answer is: 25\n\nSo far, so good.

After multiplying the derivative of e^x by cos(x) and adding it to the derivative of sin(x), you will get the derivative of the function at x=4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1 + (e^4) * (cos(4))\n\nSince we need to round down to an integer, we get: Therefore, the final answer is: 3\n\nThe derivative of the function at x=4 is approximately 3. This value tells us how the function changes as x varies from 4. In this case, it tells us that if x is 4, then the function increases by approximately 3 units."}]
