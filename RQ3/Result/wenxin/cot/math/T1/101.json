Recognize that `sinh(x)` and `cos(x)` are both trigonometric functions, so we can use the properties of the trigonometric functions to simplify the expression.\n2. Differentiate `sinh(x)` with respect to x to get `cosh(x)`, which is a related function to `sinh(x)` that is easier to integrate.\n3. Differentiate `cos(x)` with respect to x to get `-sin(x)`, which cancels out with the negative sign in front of `sinh(x)` in the original expression.\n4. Simplify the expression by multiplying out the terms to get `cosh(x) - sinh(x) * sin(x)`.\n\nNow that we have simplified the expression, we can integrate it using standard integration techniques. The indefinite integral of `cosh(x) - sinh(x) * sin(x)` is `-sinh(x) * cos(x) + C`, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into this result, we get `-sinh(4) * cos(4) + C`.
