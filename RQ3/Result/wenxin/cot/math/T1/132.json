The indefinite integral will be the original function minus a constant, which we will find by evaluating the integral at x=4.\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of sinh(x). It's d(sinh(x))/dx = cosh(x). Then, we can use the chain rule to find the derivative of the composite function cos(sinh(x)) with respect to x: d(cos(sinh(x)))/dx = -sin(sinh(x)) * d(sinh(x))/dx = -sin(sinh(x)) * cosh(x).\n\nNow, we can integrate this derivative with respect to x to find the indefinite integral: -sin(sinh(x)) * cosh(x) dx.\n\nTo evaluate this at x=4, we simply replace x with 4 in the integral. The result will be a new expression that we need to simplify.\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get -sin(sin 4) * cosh 4 dx. Evaluating this at x=4, we get -sin(sin 4) * cosh 4.\n\nNow, we need to find a constant C such that cos(sinh(4)) = C. Substituting 4 for x in the cosine function and using the properties of hyperbolic functions, we get C = cos(sinh(4)) = cos(2).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -2.\n\nPlease note that this result is rounded down to the nearest integer (i.e., -2)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(sinh(x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f cos(sinh(x))\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u6309\u7167\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\uff1a\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u9053 sinh \u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u5373 d(sinh(x)) / dx = cosh(x)\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u94fe\u5f0f\u6cd5\u5219\u6c42\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f97\u5230 cos(sinh(x)) \u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u4e3a -sin(sinh(x)) * cosh(x)\u3002\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6c42\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5373 -sin(sinh(x)) * cosh(x) dx\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5c06 x \u66ff\u6362\u4e3a 4\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f cos(sinh(x))\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a\uff1a1\u3002\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\u6b64\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6574\u6570 1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u5411\u4e0b\u53d6\u6574\u3002"}]
