To substitute 'x=4', we need to evaluate the indefinite integral at x=4. We have: e^(sin(4)) - C. To simplify the expression further, we can use the property of the sine function that sin(4) is approximately 0.866. Therefore, the final answer is: e^0.866 - C, where C is an unknown constant.\n\nTo calculate the final result, we need to know the value of C. We can't calculate it from the given information, so we need to consider other methods, such as finding the derivative of the function and integrating it back to find C.\n\nSince we don't know the value of C, we can't provide a precise integer result for this question. However, if we were to guess a value for C, we could approximate the result as e^(0.866) - C. Using a calculator, we can approximate e^(0.866) as 2.72 for rounding down.
