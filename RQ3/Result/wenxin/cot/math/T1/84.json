The indefinite integral becomes ln(u) = ln(x + 1) = ln(u), which is easily integrable using a constant C, since it depends only on x. Integrating from x to u, we get ln(u) - ln(x). Therefore, we need to solve for x to find C, and the indefinite integral becomes ln(x + 1) - x.\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this expression, we get ln(5) - 4. To find the integer result, we need to round down to the nearest integer. Therefore, the final answer is: 1.\n\nNow let's consider another function: f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of f(x), we can use the substitution u = x + 1, which transforms the function into a polynomial. The indefinite integral becomes ln|u| + C. Integrating from u = x + 1 to x, we get ln|x + 1| + D, where D is an unknown constant.\n\nNow if we substitute 'x=4' into this expression, we get ln(5) + D.
