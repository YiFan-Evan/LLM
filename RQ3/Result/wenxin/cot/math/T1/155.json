Differentiate the function `cos(x)` with respect to x to get `-sin(x)`.\n2. Substitute `cos(x)` with its derivative to get `-sin(cos(x)) = -sin(-sin(x)) = sin(sin(x))`.\n3. Now, we need to integrate this function with respect to x. We can use the following formula:\n\n\u222bf(x)dx = F(x) + C, where F(x) is the indefinite integral of f(x) with respect to x.\n\nTo find F(x), we need to evaluate the integral:\n\u222bsin(sin(x))dx.\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Change the integral to an indefinite form by integrating with respect to sin(x): \u222bsin(x)f'(x)dx = F(x) + C.\n2. Differentiate sin(x) with respect to x to get cos(x).\n3. Substitute cos(x) into the integral to get \u222bcosxdcos(x).\n4. Evaluate the integral by using the fundamental theorem of calculus: F(x) = cos(x) + C.\n\nNow that we have F(x), we can substitute x=4 into it to get the final result: F(4) = cos(4) + C. To find C, we can integrate sin(x) again and add it to our result: \u222bcosxdsin(x) = -sin\u00b2(x) + D, where D is the constant of integration. Now, if we substitute x=4 into our original F(x), we get the following expression: (cos(4)) - sin\u00b2(4) + D = final result, which can be simplified to (1 + D). To find D, we need to solve \u222b(-sin\u00b2(x))dx, which is simply sin\u00b2(x) + C. Substituting x=4 into this expression gives us (sin\u00b2(4)) + C = C + 16. Therefore, the final answer is: (C + 16).\n\nHowever, since C is an arbitrary constant, it doesn't affect the final result. Therefore, the final answer is: 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(cos(x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u60a8\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff1acos(cos(x))\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5148\u5bf9cos(x)\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5b83\u7684\u5bfc\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a-sin(x)\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u518d\u5c06cos(x)\u4ee3\u5165\u6c42\u5bfc\u540e\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5230\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u4e3asin(sin(x))\u3002\n\n\u63a5\u7740\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ee5\u6c42\u5f97\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u503c\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3aF(x)+C\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dF(x)\u4e3a\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u503c\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee3\u5165F(x)\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e2d\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u518d\u5c06x=4\u4ee3\u5165\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e2d\u3002\n\n\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u4ee3\u5165\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3acos(4)\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0fcos(cos(x))\u7684\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\uff1acos(4)\u3002"}]
