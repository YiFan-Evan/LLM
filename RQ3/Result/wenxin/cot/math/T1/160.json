You can calculate it using the hyperbolic cosine function and it's properties. Therefore, we know that cosh(4) = (e^4 + 1)/2 and that e^4 is approximately equal to 6.7. Therefore, cosh(4)^2 is approximately equal to 37. Therefore, the final answer is: 36*\u221a2 - 1/16 = 35.9375\n\nPlease note that this result is rounded down to the nearest integer.
