If we let 'x' be '4' in the expression above, then:\n\n\u222b(e^4/e^(4) dx) = (1/e^(4)) x (4)\n\nWe have simplified the expression further by cancelling out the e^(4) term and applying the chain rule. Therefore, the final answer is: 4.\n\nNote: This is a simplification and may not be the case for all values of 'x'.
