We start by writing the indefinite integral as the sum of the integral sign and the indefinite integral itself:\n\n\u222be^(x^2)dx = e^(x^2) + C\n\nThe indefinite integral can be solved by using the fundamental theorem of calculus, which states that the indefinite integral of a function with respect to a variable is equal to the limit of a sum of infinitesimal rectangles, which approaches a straight line. In this case, we can write:\n\n\u222be^(x^2)dx = \u222b(1 + x^2)dx = \u222b1dx + \u222bx^2dx\n\nThe indefinite integral of 1 is 0 (because it's just a constant), so we can ignore it. The indefinite integral of x^2 is x^3/3, so we can write:\n\n\u222be^(x^2)dx = x^3/3 + C\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this result, we get:\n\n\u222be^(4^2)dx = (4^3)/3 + C = 16/3 + C\n\nSince C is a constant, we can ignore it and just take the integer result:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x^2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u6c42\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206e^(x^2)\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u79ef\u5206\u516c\u5f0f\u222be^udu = u + C\uff0c\u5176\u4e2du = x^2\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5176\u5e26\u5165\u5f97\u222be^(x^2)dx = x^2 * e^(x^2) + C\u3002\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06x=4\u4ee3\u5165\u6c42\u89e3\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\uff0c\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206e^(x^2)\u5728x=4\u4e0a\u7684\u503c\u4e3a5\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f[5]\u3002"}]
