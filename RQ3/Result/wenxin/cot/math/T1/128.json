This formula states that the indefinite integral of f(x) * g(x) is f(x) * g(x) + C, where C is a constant. Therefore, the indefinite integral of x^2*(1+x) is x^3 + x^2 + C.\n\nTo find the value of x=4, we need to plug it into the indefinite integral. The result will be 4^3 + 4^2 + C.\n\nTo simplify this, we can rewrite the indefinite integral as (x^3 + x^2) + C. Then, when we plug in x=4, we get 4^3 + 4^2 + C = 64 + 16 + C.\n\nTo find the constant C, we can subtract the constant term from the result. This will give us C = 48.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The indefinite integral of x^2*(1+x) with x=4 is 64 + 16 + 48 = 128.\n\nNow that we have found the indefinite integral of the function, we can now find its value at x=4 by plugging it into the indefinite integral and simplifying it. The result will be an integer number representing the final result. In this case, it is 128."}, {"role": "user", "content": "x^2*(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u60a8\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0cx^2*(1+x)\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u662fx^3+2*x^2\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\u5728x=4\u65f6\u4e3a64\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5f53\u81ea\u53d8\u91cf\u4e3ax=4\u65f6\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u503c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u5165\u6c42\u5f97\u3002\u5728\u4e0a\u8ff0\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\uff0c\u5c06x=4\u4ee3\u5165\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\uff1a64+4^2=72\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f53x=4\u65f6\uff0cx^2*(1+x)\u7684\u503c\u7ea6\u4e3a72\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u56db\u820d\u4e94\u5165\u53d6\u6574\u5f97\u5230\u7ed3\u679c72\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a\u5f53x=4\u65f6\uff0cx^2*(1+x)\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f72\u3002"}]
