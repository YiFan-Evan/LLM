This expression is equal to e to the indefinite integral of e^x, which can be calculated as (1 + e^(e^x)). Now that we have calculated the indefinite integral, we can substitute 'x=4' to find the final result.\n\nThe indefinite integral of e^x with respect to x at x=4 is (1 + e^(e^4)). Substituting x=4 into this result, we get the final expression: (1 + e^(e^4)) at x=4. To simplify this expression, we can apply the properties of exponents and irrational functions. Since e^4 is approximately 8.9457, the final result is approximately 2.
