The indefinite integral is e^x*x^2 + C, where C is a constant. To substitute 'x=4', we simply need to replace x with 4 in the indefinite integral. The result will be e^(4)*4^2 + C, which simplifies to 64*e^4 + C. To find the integer result, we need to round down the value of e^4, which is approximately 20. Therefore, the final answer is: Therefore, the final answer is: 20*64 + C, where C is an unknown constant.\n\nTo find the value of C, we need to integrate again with the definite integral calculator. We can use the value of e^4 + C from before and plug it into the formula for the definite integral. The definite integral of e^x*x^2 from 0 to 4 is e^(x^2) + C, which we can solve for C by subtracting e^(4)^2 from the result. This gives us 2C = 20*64 - 64*e^4 = 64*(C - e^4), which we can solve for C by setting up an equation with integer coefficients: C = (e^4 + 64)/2. This results in the final answer: Therefore, the final answer is: 32.\n\nTherefore, given the mathematical function expression e^x*x^2, the indefinite integral is e^x*x^2 + C, and when 'x=4', the result is 32."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x*x^2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u7ed9\u5b9a\u51fd\u6570 e^x * x^2\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a e^x * x^2 + C\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d C \u662f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u8981\u6c42\u53ea\u53d6\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u800c\u4e0d\u5305\u62ec\u5e38\u6570 C\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u7ed3\u679c\u5c31\u662f e^x * x^2\u3002\n\n\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7ed9\u5b9a x=4 \u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c06 x=4 \u4ee3\u5165\u4e0a\u5f0f\u5373\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0ce^(4) * 4^2 = 16 * e^4\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u6570\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5bf9 e^4 \u8fdb\u884c\u53d6\u6574\u8fd0\u7b97\u3002\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u4e2d\uff0ce \u7684\u503c\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9650\u4e0d\u5faa\u73af\u5c0f\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u4f8b\u5982 e^4 \u7684\u524d\u51e0\u4f4d\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u6574\u6570\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0ce^4 \u2248 20.0918\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f 20.0918 * 16 = 32.9078 \u2248 32\u3002"}]
