We can then integrate this expression to find c.\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of ln(x) which is 1/x. Then, we can substitute this derivative into our function expression, giving us x^2/(x) = x^2.\n\nNext, we can apply the integration formula to this new expression to find c. We have that the indefinite integral of x^2 is 2x^2.\n\nNow, if we set x = 4, we can substitute this value into our integral expression and simplify to find our final result. We get 2 * (4)^2 = 32.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 32."}, {"role": "user", "content": "x^2/ln(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570 x^2/ln(x)\uff0c\u5176\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u662f x^2 * ln(x) + c\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d c \u662f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u5f53 x = 4 \u65f6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a 32\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f 32\u3002"}]
