Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Start with the integrand: sin(x) * sin(sin(x))\n2. Separate the sin(x) term into two parts: sin(x) and sin(x) * sin(x)\n3. Integrate sin(x) * sin(x) term using the integration formula for sin:\n\u222bsin(x) * sin(x)dx = -cos(x) * sin(x) + C\n4. Integrate the sin(x) term using the addition formula for sin:\n\u222bsin(x)dx = -cos(sin(x)) + C'\n5. Subtract C' from the result of step 3 to get the final indefinite integral:\n\u222b(-cos(sin(x)) * sin(x) + cos(x) * sin(x))dx = -sin(x) + cos(x) + C\n\nNow that we have the indefinite integral, we need to substitute 'x=4' and get the final result. Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral gives us:\n\n\u222b(-sin(4) + cos(4) + C) = -sin(4) + cos(4) + C'\n\nThe constant C' is not known, so we can't calculate the final result yet. However, we can simplify the expression further by setting 'C' to zero, which leaves us with:\n\n\u222b(-sin(4) + cos(4)) = -sin(4) + cos(4) = -sqrt(2)+5 (rounded down to the integer result)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sin(x)*sin(sin(x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570sin(x)*sin(sin(x))\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u516c\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5c06sin(x)\u548csin(sin(x))\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u522b\u6c42\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6c42\u548c\u5e76\u52a0\u4e0a\u5e38\u6570C\u5373\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u89d2\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u516c\u5f0f\u6765\u7b80\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\n\n\u5177\u4f53\u6b65\u9aa4\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n1. \u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5c06sin(x)\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206 -cos(x) + C \u4ee3\u5165\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u3002\n2. \u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5c06sin(sin(x))\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3acos(sin(x)) - cos(x)\uff0c\u5e76\u6c42\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u3002\n3. \u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u52a0\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\n\n\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\uff1a-cos(sin(x)) + cos(x)\u3002\n\n\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u5c06x=4\u4ee3\u5165\u8be5\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\uff1a-cos(sin(4)) + cos(4) = -sqrt(2)+5\uff08\u5411\u4e0b\u53d6\u6574\uff09\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a\uff1a-2\u3002"}]
