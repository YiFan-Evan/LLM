Recognize that the function is a ratio of two functions, where one function (sinh(x)) is an even function, meaning its derivative is zero at x=0. Therefore, we can ignore the constant C term when integrating.\n\n2. The indefinite integral of 1/sinh(x) is equal to (ln|sinh(x)|) + C, where C is a constant of integration.\n\n3. To find the value of x=4, substitute it into the indefinite integral.\n\n4. We get ln|sinh(4)| = ln(2.449489742783916) = 1.386494753087693, which is approximately equal to 1.
