This involves using the definition of integration and replacing the function by its antiderivative. The antiderivative of cos(x) is -sin(x) + C, so the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222bcos(x) * xdx = -sin(x^2/2) + C.\n\nTo substitute 'x=4', we simply replace x with 4 in the above expression:\n\n\u222bcos(4x) * 4dx = -sin(4^2/2) + C.\n\nNow, to find the final result, we need to evaluate the integral at x=4. To do this, we need to evaluate the expression above with x=4, which becomes:\n\n-sin(4^2/2) + C. To simplify this further, we can rewrite sin(4^2/2) as (2*sqrt(2)*sin(pi/4))/4 = sqrt(2), and simplify C to 0. This gives us:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -sqrt(2).\n\nPlease note that this result is an approximation, as it is rounded down to the nearest integer. If you require a more accurate result, you would need to use a more advanced method of integration or use a calculator with greater precision."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x)*x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u5df2\u77e5\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e3a\uff1acos(x)*x\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6cd5\u5219\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u51fd\u6570cos(x)\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5373-sin(x) + C\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u4e0ex\u76f8\u4e58\u5e76\u6c42\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n\n\u222b(cos(x)*x)dx = -sin(x*x) + C'\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dC'\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u5c06x=4\u4ee3\u5165\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u4e0a\u8ff0\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684x\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a4\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n\n\u222b(cos(4x)*4)dx = -sin(4^2*x) + C'\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u6c42\u5f97\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5c06sin(4^2*x)\u7684\u503c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3asin(\u03c0/2)\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a4^2*x\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e8e\u03c0/2\u3002\u6b64\u65f6\u5e38\u6570C'\u88ab\u5ffd\u7565\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n-sin(\u03c0/2) = -1\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0ccos(x)*x\u5728x=4\u65f6\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u4e3a\uff1a-1\u3002"}]
