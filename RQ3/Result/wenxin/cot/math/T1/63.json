Substituting x = 4, we get (4*ln(4) - 4^2) / 4e^4. To calculate the final result, we need to know the value of the indefinite integral. Unfortunately, we don't know the indefinite integral of x^2/e^x. The only definite integral of this function is x=0. In this case, we cannot substitute x=4 into the result. We can calculate indefinite integral for x^2/e^x in another way. Firstly, let's notice that: e^x = e^(ln(x)) + ln(x). Using this, we can write x^2/e^x as (x*ln(x) + x)/e^(ln(x)) = (x*ln(x) + 1)/e^(x*ln(x)). The indefinite integral of this function is (1/ln(x) - x)/e^(x*ln(x)). Therefore, the final answer is: 1.
