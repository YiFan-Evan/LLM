The indefinite integral of this expression is u^2/(1+u)dx = -1/u + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of x*x/(1+x) is -x + C.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace x with 4: -4 + C.\n\nFinally, to find the integer result, we simply round down the value of C.
