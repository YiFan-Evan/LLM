This formula states that the indefinite integral of f(x) * g(x) is f(x) * g(x) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the indefinite integral of x^2 and (1+x). Let's start with x^2. This function is an even function, which means that its indefinite integral is zero. Therefore, the indefinite integral of x^2 is 0.\n\nNow, let's integrate (1+x). This function is an odd function, which means that its indefinite integral is zero as well. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1+x) is also 0.\n\nFinally, we need to multiply the indefinite integral of x^2 and (1+x) and add a constant C to get the final result. The constant C will be the value of the integration constant. To find it, we need to plug in some values into the integrand. In this case, we'll use x=4.\n\nTherefore, x=4 is plugged into the expression: (x^2*(1+x)) = (4^2*(1+4)) = 72.\n\nThe constant C is 0, so the final result is: 72 + 0 = 72.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 72."}, {"role": "user", "content": "x^2*(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570 x^2*(1+x)\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5176\u8868\u793a\u4e3af(x) = x^2 * (1+x)\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u6211\u4eec\u6c42\u5176\u539f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9 x^2 \u6c42\u539f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a x^2 + C1\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d C1 \u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8981\u6c42(1+x)\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u52a0\u6cd5\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u5f97\u5230 (1+x) \u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a \u222b(1+x)dx = (x+1) + C2\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d C2 \u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u51fd\u6570 x^2*(1+x) \u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a f(x) = (x^2 + C1)*(x+1) + C3\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d C3 \u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u5c06 x=4 \u4ee3\u5165\u8be5\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u5f97\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a f(4) = (4^2 + C1)*(4+1) + C3 = 72 + C3\u3002\u56e0\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570 C3 \u53ef\u4ee5\u4efb\u610f\u53d6\u503c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u65f6\uff0cC3 \u5fc5\u987b\u4e3a 0\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u51fd\u6570 x^2*(1+x) \u5728 x=4 \u65f6\u7684\u503c\u4e3a 72\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a72\u3002"}]
