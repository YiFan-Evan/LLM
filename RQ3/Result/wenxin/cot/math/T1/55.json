We can do this by applying the integration formula: u = x^2, where u is a new variable that is independent of x, and du = 2x, where the constant 2 is added for convenience. This results in the integral expression: \u222b (u/u + c) du = (ln|u| + c * u + c1) d(x), where c is the integration constant. Since our original function is x^2/x, u = x^2. The integration constant can be derived by replacing x^2 in the indefinite integral with x (for this step, it's more convenient to leave c1 out for simplicity), so the result of the indefinite integral is (ln|x^2| + c * x) dx.\n\nNow, we need to substitute 'x=4' into this result. We know that ln(4^2) = 2ln4 = 2*1.44 = 2.88, and c * 4 = 4*1 = 4. Therefore, the final expression is: \u222b (4^2/4 + 4) dx = (ln|4^2| + 4 * x) dx when x=4.\n\nThe final answer is: \u222b (4^2/4 + 4) dx = 9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "x^2/x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570 x^2/x\uff0c\u5176\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\uff1a\u222b (x^2/x) dx\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5c06x^2/x\u53d8\u5f62\u4e3a(x^2-1+1)/x\uff0c\u5373\u222b (x^2-1+1)/x dx\u3002\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u628ax\u4f5c\u4e3au\u8fdb\u884c\u6362\u5143\uff0c\u5373\u4ee4u=x^2-1\uff0cdu=2xdx\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u222b (x^2-1+1)/x dx\u53ef\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u222b (u+1)/u dx\u3002\u518d\u5bf9(u+1)/u\u8fdb\u884c\u6362\u5143\uff0c\u5373\u4ee4v=u+1\uff0cdv=du-1*dx\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u222b (x^2/x) dx\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u222b (v/v) dv\u3002\n\n\u5c06v\u4ee3\u5165\u79ef\u5206\u5f0f\u4e2d\u540e\uff0cdx\u5c31\u53d8\u4e3adv\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u7ed3\u679c\u5c31\u662fln(x)+C\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8981\u6c42\u5c06x=4\u4ee3\u5165\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a\uff1aln(4)+C\uff08C\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\uff09\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5f53x=4\u65f6\uff0c\u51fd\u6570x^2/x\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\uff1a3\u3002"}]
