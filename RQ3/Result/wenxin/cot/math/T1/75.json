To do this, we can use a calculator or a computer program. However, manually evaluating the indefinite integral is a bit tricky because it involves trigonometric functions.\n\nHere's how I would approach it:\n\n1. Differentiate the cosine function to get sin(4).\n2. Substitute sin(4) for -sin(x) in the indefinite integral.\n3. Simplify the denominator by multiplying by x^2.\n4. Integrate again to get an indefinite integral of a constant (C).\n5. Subtract C from both sides to get the final result.\n\nIn this case, I'm not sure if there's a closed-form solution for this indefinite integral, so I would need to use a numerical method like integration by parts or other numerical methods to approximate the result. This requires more steps and involves more error because it's a numerical method.\n\nTherefore, I suggest using a calculator or computer program to find the final result, which is: -sin(4) / 16 + C = -sin(4) / 16 + C, where C is a constant.
