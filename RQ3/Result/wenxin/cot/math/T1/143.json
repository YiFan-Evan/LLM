This substitution will turn the denominator into a polynomial that can be integrated easily.\n\nSo, we have:\n\u222bx^2/(1+x)dx = \u222b(u-1+1)/(u)du = \u222b(u-1)du + \u222b1/(u)du\n\nNow, we can simplify the second integral by using the substitution v = 1/u:\n\u222b1/(u)du = \u222bv/dv * dv/du = -v + C\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral becomes:\n\u222b(u-1)du + (-v + C) = (u^2)/2 - u + v*u + C'\n\nNow, let's substitute 'x=4' into this expression:\n\u222b(4^2-4+v*4+C')dx = \u222b(16-4+4v+C')dx\n\nTo simplify this further, we need to evaluate the constant C':\nC' = C - \u222bv*du = C - ln(u) |_ (1+x=0) = C - ln(1+x)|_ (x=4)\n\nTo evaluate this integral, we need to use the approximation ln(1+x) ~ x for small x (where x is much less than 1).

We can easily do this because the result of the indefinite integral was just found to be 6. The value of the definite integral will be: 6*dx, where dx is an arbitrary variable representing the range of values x can take on. In this case, dx is 4 because x starts at 4 and goes up in steps of 4. Therefore, the definite integral becomes: 6*4 = 24.\n\nFinally, we need to round down the integer result to get an exact answer.

The correct expression is: x^2/(1+x). The indefinite integral of this expression is: \u222bx^2/(1+x)dx = \u222bx(1-x)/(1+x)dx. The integration of this expression needs to perform substitution to simplify the denominator. Let u = 1 + x, then du = (1+x)dx. The indefinite integral becomes: \u222bu*u-1du = \u222bu^2-u dx. Now, we can integrate the polynomial part of the denominator and use the substitution u = 1/v to simplify the rest of the expression. After completing the indefinite integral, let's substitute x=4 into it to find the definite integral. Then round down the result to get an exact answer. The final result is 4, rounded down to be 2."}]
