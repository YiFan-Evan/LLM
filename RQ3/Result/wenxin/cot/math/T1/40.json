To substitute 'x=4', we need to evaluate the indefinite integral at x=4. The indefinite integral is e^(cos(4)) - C. To evaluate at x=4, we need to know the value of cos(4). However, cos(4) is not a value that is commonly found in trigonometric tables or calculators, and is a complex number, which is why it's generally recommended to avoid using trigonometric functions in complicated or unusual situations. If you are still interested in calculating the indefinite integral at x=4, we would need more information about what context you are using this function in. If it's just for practice or research, then we can simply approximate it with a value like 0.866. Therefore, the final answer is: 1.597e^0.866 - C.\n\nNow, to round down to an integer result, we need to multiply the result by 10^5 (since e^x is approximately equal to 2.71828 when x is very small), so we get: 1.597 * 10^5e^0.866 * 10^-5 - C.
