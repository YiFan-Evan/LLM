So the first term becomes x * ln(x) * e^x.\n\nSecond, we need to find the indefinite integral of ln(x) = 1/x. So the second term becomes \u222b(1/x) dx = -ln(x).\n\nPutting it all together, we get: (x * ln(x) * e^x) - (-ln(x)) = x * ln(x) * e^x + ln(x).\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4', we get: \u222b(1+e^4) * ln(4) dx = 3*ln(4)+4*ln(e). This result is in the form of a sum of a constant and a logarithm.\n\nFinally, we need to simplify this expression and provide it as an integer result. We can simplify the expression by converting it to an exponential function, because it has only one term and we know that the sum of logs is equal to the product of exponentials. So we have: 3*ln(4)+4*ln(e) = (3+4)*ln(e).
