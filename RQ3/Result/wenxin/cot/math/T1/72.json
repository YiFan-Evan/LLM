We know that e^x is exponential growth, and it grows much faster than linear growth, so we can approximate it as a linear function for simplicity. Therefore, the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(e^x*(1/x)) = e^x - x\n\nNow, we need to substitute 'x=4' into this result. Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral gives us:\n\n\u222b(e^4*(1/4)) = e^4 - 4\n\nTo simplify this further, we can use the properties of exponentiation and subtraction to get:\n\ne^4 - 4 = e^4 - e^-4 = e^(e^4) = e^(e^4 * 2) = e^(e^2 * 2^2) = e^(e^2 * 4)\n\nThe final result is an integer number representing the final result of the expression. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe indefinite integral of e^x*(1/x) with 'x=4' is 17.\n\nI hope this helped!
