In other words, it's a mathematical expression that contains the natural logarithm function (ln) of a variable (x) and an integration constant (C).\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of ln(x), we need to solve for the variable x, which is not included in the expression. Therefore, we can simply ignore the constant C and solve for x:\n\n\u222bln(x)dx = ln(x) + C => ln(x) = 2\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we need to plug it into the previous expression:\n\n\u222bln(4)dx = ln(4) + C\n\nFinally, since the answer we're looking for is a single integer, we need to find the value of the integration constant C that satisfies the above equation. Let's take a look at both possible answers:\n\nC=2: This is the case where ln(4) = 2. The indefinite integral becomes ln(4) + C = 2 + C. Therefore, if we plug in C=2, we get 2 + 2 = 4, which rounds down to 4.\n\nC=1: This is also a valid case where ln(4) = 1. The indefinite integral becomes ln(4) + C = 1 + C. Therefore, if we plug in C=1, we get 1 + 1 = 2, which rounds down to 2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The indefinite integral of ln(x) with x=4 is equal to either 4 or 2, depending on the value of the integration constant C."}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\uff0cln(x)\u4ee3\u8868\u7684\u662f\u4ee5\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u6570e\u4e3a\u5e95\uff0cx\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u5217\u7684\u901a\u9879\u516c\u5f0f\u662ff(n)=e^n\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48ln(x)\u5c31\u662f\u6c42\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6570\u5217\u4e2dx\u5bf9\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6570\u503c\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0cln(x)\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u5c31\u662f\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u5373f'(x)=ln(x)\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6027\u8d28\u5728\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u8868\u660eln(x)\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5fae\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u4e0e\u5b83\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u503c\u6709\u5173\u3002\n\n\u81f3\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5b83\u9700\u8981\u6c42\u51fa\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e00\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u7b49\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8eln(x)\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u662f\u222bln(x)dx=xln(x)-x+C\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dC\u662f\u4efb\u610f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee3\u5165x=4\u5e76\u53d6\u6574\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6309\u7167\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\uff1a\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u7684x\u75284\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u5f97\u52304ln(4)-4+C\u3002\n\n\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u53d6\u6574\uff0c\u5f97\u52304\u62163\uff08\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8eC\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u503c\uff09\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a4\u62163\uff0c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8eC\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u503c\u3002"}]
