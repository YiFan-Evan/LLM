In this case, s(x) = x. Therefore, the indefinite integral of sin(x) is equal to sin(x) * x.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace x with 4. So, the indefinite integral of sin(4) becomes sin(4) * 4.\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down the result. So, if we round down sin(4) * 4, we get -6.
