[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

The indefinite integral of ln(x) is 1/x, and the indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x). Therefore, the indefinite integral of ln(x) * sin(x) becomes (ln(x) - cos(x)).\n\nTo substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply need to replace the 'x' in the function with '4'. Therefore, the indefinite integral of ln(4) * sin(4) becomes ln(4) - cos(4).\n\nFinally, to find the integer result, we need to simplify the expression and round down to the smallest integer that can represent it. In this case, we have ln(4) = 1 + ln(2), which is approximately 1.73205. Then we have -cos(4) = -0.927225, which is approximately -1.06636. Therefore, the final result is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0.\n\nPlease note that this result assumes that ln(2) is approximately 0.693147, which is commonly used in scientific calculations. If you prefer to use other values for ln(2), you may adjust accordingly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(x)*sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570 ln(x) * sin(x)\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u6309\u7167\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\u8fdb\u884c\uff1a\n\n1. \u5c06\u51fd\u6570 ln(x) * sin(x) \u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5373 ln(x) \u548c sin(x)\u3002\n2. \u5bf9 ln(x) \u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c 1/x\u3002\n3. \u5bf9 sin(x) \u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c -cos(x)\u3002\n4. \u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u4e58\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a (ln(x) - cos(x))\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u9700\u8981\u5c06 x=4 \u4ee3\u5165\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5c06 x \u66ff\u6362\u4e3a 4 \u5373\u53ef\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u51fd\u6570 ln(x) * sin(x) \u5728 x=4 \u65f6\u7684\u503c\u4e3a\uff1a$(ln(4) - cos(4)) = ln(4) - \\lbrack-1+2\\rbrack \\approx 0.7321$\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ecb\u4e8e\u6b63\u8d1f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u503c\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u53d6\u5176\u6574\u6570\u90e8\u5206\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5373\u7ea6\u7b49\u4e8e 0\u3002"}]
