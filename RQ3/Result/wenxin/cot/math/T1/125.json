To substitute 'x=4', we simply need to replace the variable 'x' with the value '4'. Therefore, the final expression is: 2 * sin(4) + C.\n\nTo calculate the value of C, we need to integrate sin(x) with a constant of 1 (since sin(x) has period 2\u03c0), so we can multiply our indefinite integral by 2\u03c0 (since this will make C depend on \u03c0 as a scaling factor) to get C = \u03c0 * sin(4) + B. Since B is constant and does not depend on x, we can drop it from the expression. Therefore, the final expression is: \u03c0 * sin(4).\n\nTo find the integer result, we need to round down the decimal result.
