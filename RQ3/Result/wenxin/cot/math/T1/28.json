Therefore, the result of substituting 'x=4' into this expression is (4^2)/2 + C. To find the final answer, we need to know the value of C. If we integrate x from 0 to 4, the indefinite integral will be 4^2/2 - 0^2/2 = 8. However, since we don't know the value of C, we can't give you the exact final answer.
