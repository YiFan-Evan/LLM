The derivative of ln(x) is just 1/x, which we're integrating.\n\nSo, the indefinite integral becomes: \u222b(cos(x)/x) d(1/x). Now, we can use the chain rule to find the derivative of this integral with respect to x: (\u2212sin(x)/x^2). To find the indefinite integral again, we multiply by x and integrate again: \u222b(\u2212sin(x)/x^2) dx.\n\nSo, putting it all together, we have: \u222b(\u2212sin(x)/x^2) dx + C, where C is a constant.
