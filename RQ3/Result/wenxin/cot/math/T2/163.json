The indefinite integral becomes 5 * (u^2)^(-1) * u^(-2) * du, which simplifies to 5 * du. Now, substituting x = 4, we get 5 * du when you substitute x = 4. To evaluate this derivative at x = 4, we can use the definition of the derivative at a point. We get that the derivative at x = 4 is simply the value of the integral itself. So, 5 * du at x = 4 equals 5 * (4) = 20. Therefore, the final answer is: 20."}]
