The simplest method would be to find a maximum or minimum value for the integrand and approximate the indefinite integral with that value. For sin(x), the maximum value occurs at x=\u03c0/2 (90 degrees), and for (1+x), the maximum value occurs at x=4. Therefore, we can approximate the indefinite integral as:\n\n(- 5/2) + (5/2)*sin(4)\n\nThe final result is: 3. Therefore, the final answer is: 3.
