Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1+cos(x)) is -cos(x).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we need to replace cos(x) with its value at x=4, which is -1.

The indefinite integral of 1 + cos(x) is -sin(x) + C, so the indefinite integral of 5 times (1 + cos(x)) is 5 times (-sin(x) + C). To substitute 'x=4' into this result, we need to replace sin(x) with its value at x=4, which is -1.

Since we don't know the value of C, we can't round it down accurately. However, if we assume that C is a positive integer, then the final result would be 5. If C is a negative integer or a non-integer number, then the final result would be different.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5.
