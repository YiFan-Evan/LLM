This rule says that if we have a function times a constant, then we can factor that constant out and make it a new variable, so the result of the integral is the original function times the new variable plus the constant.\n\nIn this case, the constant is 0, because it is multiplied by the denominator (1+x) and doesn't appear in the denominator's integrand. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as (x^2/1) + c, where c is an arbitrary constant (because the integral includes the 1/1 term, which doesn't have a definite value until we integrate).\n\nNow let's substitute 'x=4' into this expression. When x=4, we get: ((4^2)/(1+4)) + c = 6 + c. The result depends on what c is, but for simplicity's sake, let's say c=0. So, if x=4, the result is 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(x*x/(1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function 5*(x*x/(1+x)) is still 5*(x^2/1 + C).
