This function is defined as the derivative of the hyperbolic cosine function with respect to the argument x, so the indefinite integral is just the hyperbolic cosine function multiplied by an integrating factor. In this case, the integrating factor is 1 + x^2, which we can factor out of the integrand to get: (x^2 + 1) * sinh(x^2). Now, to evaluate this indefinite integral, we can use the formula for indefinite integration of a product to write this as the sum of two definite integrals: the first from 0 to x, with an integral value of 1/(2*x), and the second from x to infinity, with an integral value of -cosh(x)/x^3.
