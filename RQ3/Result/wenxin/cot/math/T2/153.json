This substitution allows us to rewrite the integral as a common form: \u222b(u) du = \u222b(u) d(1/u). Now, we can use the fundamental rule of integration to simplify the integral: \u222b(1/x) dx = -\u222b(1/u) d(1/u) = -ln|u| + C.\n\nSubstituting u = 1/x, we get: -ln|1/x| + C = -ln|x| + C. Since x = 4, the result of the indefinite integral is: -ln(4) + C. This result depends on the choice of C, but we can take the constant to be 0 to get our final answer: Therefore, the final answer is: -4.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of (1/x) with x = 4 is -4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1/x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5 times (1/x) is: 5 ln(x) + C.\n\nSubstituting x = 4, we get: 5 ln(4) + C.\n\nSince we don't know the constant C, we can't provide a final answer without it.
