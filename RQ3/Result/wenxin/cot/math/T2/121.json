This substitution allows us to rewrite the integral as a new integral that is easier to evaluate. The new integral will be with respect to u, which is the indefinite integral of 1/x. The indefinite integral of 1/x is ln(x) + C, where C is a constant. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1/x) is ln(x).\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get ln(4).\n\nTo find the final result, we need to evaluate the definite integral of ln(4) with respect to x from 1 to 4. This will give us the value of ln(4) at x=4. The definite integral is ln(4) - ln(1), which evaluates to ln(4) + ln(3).\n\nTo round down, we can add 1 to the result, which will give us 2 as the final integer result.
