To do this, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral of e^x/c.\n\nWe can use the derivative of e^x with respect to x to find this indefinite integral: 1/c * e^x. Substituting this into our indefinite integral of (e^4 + 4c)*4, we get (e^4 + 4c)*4 - 4/c * e^4. Now we can solve for c by setting this equal to 0 and solving for c: c = -e^4/4.
