However, in order to find the constant C, we'll need to differentiate it again after substituting 'x=4'. So the formula we need to solve is:\n\nd/dx((sinh(x))/sinh(x)/(1+x)) = d/dx((sinh(x))/x) = (cosh(x)/x^2)\n\nNow, substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get:\n\n\u222b(cosh(4)/4^2) dx = \u222b(cosh(4)/16) dx\n\nTo calculate this integral, we can use the trapezoidal rule, which is a good approximation for functions that are \"nice\" and go between 0 and 1 (which should be true for a sinh function, for most values of x). Let's take two arbitrary points in our function: x1=4 and x2=4+h.\n\nNow let's perform the steps:\n\na) Take a step with a smaller 'h': x2 = 4+0.05 (just an example, we can use any small number)\n\nb) Calculate the integral:\n\u222b(cosh(4)/16) dx = (cosh(4+0.05)/16) - (cosh(4)/16)\n\nc) Apply the trapezoidal rule:\n\u222b(cosh(4)/16) dx = (cosh(4+0.05)*1/32 - cosh(4)*1/32)/h = 0.263\n\nNow that we have calculated the indefinite integral and applied the trapezoidal rule, we need to round down to an integer result.
