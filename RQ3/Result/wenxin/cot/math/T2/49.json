The indefinite integral of ln(x) is simply x, and the indefinite integral of sin(x) is 1. Hence, we can write the integral as:\n\n\u222b(ln(x) * sin(x))dx = x * sin(x) - \u222bsin(x)dx\n\nThe indefinite integral of sin(x) is aperiodic, so we need to integrate it again from 0 to x to get the correct result. We can perform these integrations using basic integration techniques, such as integration by parts or the definition of a derivative.\n\nLet's start by integrating sin(x) from 0 to x:\n\n\u222bsin(x)dx = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow let's add this result to the integral of ln(x) * sin(x):\n\n\u222bln(x) * sin(x)dx = x * sin(x) - (-cos(x) + C')\n\nSimplifying this result gives:\n\n\u222bln(x) * sin(x)dx = x * sin(x) + cos(x) + C''\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into this result, we get:\n\n\u222bln(4) * sin(4)dx = 4 * sin(4) + cos(4) + C''\n\nTo get an integer result, we need to evaluate the final expression at a value that gives us a simple integer result.
