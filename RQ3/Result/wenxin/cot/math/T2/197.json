The indefinite integral of a product is the product of the indefinite integrals of the factors. And if one factor is a function of x, then the derivative of that factor with respect to x is multiplied by the other factor. So, for this function, we have:\n\n\u222b(1+x) * x^2 * x^2 dx = \u222b(x^2 + x) * x^2 dx = \u222bx^4 + x^3 dx\n\nNow, to calculate the indefinite integral of x^4 + x^3, we can use the derivative of a power function: d(x^n) = nx^(n-1). So, the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222bx^4 + x^3 dx = \u222bx^4 dx + \u222bx^3 dx = 1/5x^5 + 1/4x^4 + C\n\nSince we don't know the constant C, we can't substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral yet. However, if we substitute 'x=4' into the indefinite integral above and take the constant C out of the integral, we get:\n\n\u222b(1+4)*4^2*4^2 dx = \u222b(5*64) dx = 64*ln(5) + C'\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into this expression and simplifying gives us:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 16*ln(5) rounded down."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1+x)*x^2*x^2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This function is: 5*((1+x)*x^2*x^2) = 5*[x^(4) + x^5] . \n\nThe indefinite integral of 5*[x^(4) + x^5] is: 5*[x^(5)/5 + x^(6)/6] . \n\nTo substitute 'x=4' into this result, we get: \n\n\u222b(5*((1+4)*4^2*4^2)) dx = \u222b(5*(5*64)) dx = 320*ln(5) + C' . \n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into this expression and rounding down, we get: Therefore, the final answer is: 128*ln(5) rounded down."}]
