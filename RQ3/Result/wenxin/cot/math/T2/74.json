Therefore, the indefinite integral of x^2*x is 2x^3/2 + x^2.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply multiply the indefinite integral by 4 (i.e., 2*4^3/2 + 4^2 = 32 + 16 = 48).\n\nFinally, to round down the expression to an integer result, we need to multiply the result by 100 to ensure it's an integer, then round down to the nearest integer.
