The indefinite integral will be the integrand minus the constant C, so we can simplify it to just calculate the derivative of the natural logarithm and multiply it by the cosine function. The derivative of ln(x) is 1/(x) and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x). So, we can write the indefinite integral as:\n\n\u222b(cos(ln(x)) = -sin(ln(x)) + C\n\nTo find the value of this integral for x = 4, we need to substitute 4 for x in the above expression and solve for C. This will give us an expression in terms of ln(4), which we can evaluate using its derivative. After doing this, we get -sin(ln(4)) + C.
