We know that for a function of the form f(x) = sin(x)/cos(x), the indefinite integral is f(x) = -cos(x) + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get -cos(4) + C.\n\nNow, to find the value of C, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral at x=4. We can use the above formula to find C: C = -cos(4) + indefinite integral at x=4.\n\nThe indefinite integral at x=4 is equal to sin(4)/cos(sin(4)). Using the same rules for evaluating trigonometric functions, we can simplify this expression to 1/cos(4). Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1.\n\nPlease note that this result is an approximation, as the value of cos(4) is approximately 0.866, which results in a rounded integer of 1.
