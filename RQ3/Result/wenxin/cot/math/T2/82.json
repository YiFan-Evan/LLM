So, we get the expression 1/cos(x) * x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral is (x^2*cos(x))/cos(x) = x^2.\n\nNow, we need to substitute 'x=4' into this indefinite integral. The result is: 64. Therefore, the final answer is: 64.\n\nTo check my work, I'll re-derive the answer: The indefinite integral is (a/b) * x^2 * cos(x) / cos(x) = x^2, which holds for all x > 0, because cos(x) approaches 1 as x approaches infinity. Now when I substitute 'x=4', the answer comes out to be 64, which matches what I wrote before."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(x^2/sin(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Let's break this function down:\n\nThe denominator is `sin(x)` so the indefinite integral would be `(x^2*cos(x))/cos(x)` . The numerator is 5 times that expression, so the final indefinite integral is `5*(x^2*cos(x))/cos(x)`.\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this indefinite integral, we get the result: 5*4^2 = 80.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 80.\n\nLet's double check my work:\n\nThe indefinite integral is (a/b) * x^2 * cos(x) / cos(x) = x^2. Substituting 'x=4' into this equation gives us 80, which matches what I wrote before."}]
