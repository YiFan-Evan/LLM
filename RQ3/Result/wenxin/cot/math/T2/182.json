The indefinite integral of (u+1)^2 is simply 2u(u+1)+C, which is equal to 2(cos(x)-1)*(cos(x)+1)+C. To simplify this, we need to find the value of C. The constant C can be eliminated by evaluating the indefinite integral with a different value of x and using the formula: C = d/dx(\u222b(f(x) dx)) when x=a, where a is a constant. Therefore, substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral, we get:\n\n\u222b(1+cos(x))^2 dx = \u222b(4+cos(4))^2 dx\n\nNow, let's use the above formula to find C:\n\nC = d/dx(\u222b(4+cos(4))^2 dx) when x=4\n\nC = d/dx(\u222b(5^2) dx) when x=4\n\nC = d/dx(20)\n\nC = 20\n\nNow that we have C, we can substitute it back into the indefinite integral:\n\n\u222b(1+cos(x))^2 dx = \u222b((4+cos(4))^2 dx) = \u222b(cos(4)^2+8+4*cos(4)+C) dx\n\n\u222bcos(4)^2+8+4*cos(4) dx = (2*cos^3(4)+sin(4)*cos(4)+4)+C\n\nWe know that cos(4) will be between -1 and 1, so let's evaluate this integral for both positive and negative values of C to see what happens. Let's assume C is positive. Evaluating the integral for C=5 gives us:\n\n\u222b((4+cos(4))^2 dx = (2*cos^3(4)+sin(4)*cos(4)+4)+5 = 7.767667...\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of (1+cos(x))^2 with x=4 is equal to 7.
