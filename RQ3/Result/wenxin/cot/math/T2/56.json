This substitution is valid because the denominator of the function is cos(x), which is always negative or zero. Therefore, we can rewrite the function as u^2/u = u + 1.\n\nNow, we can use the definition of indefinite integration to find the indefinite integral of x^2/cos(x). We get 2x*sin(u)*du/cos(u) = 2x*sin(u)*du/(1-u^2)^0.5.\n\nSimplifying further, we get 2x*sin(u)*du/(1-cos(u)). Now, we can evaluate this indefinite integral by substituting u = cos(x) and integrating with respect to x.
