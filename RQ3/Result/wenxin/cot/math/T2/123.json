This states that the indefinite integral of a function f(x) is equal to f(x) plus the integral of its derivative. In this case, we need to find the indefinite integral of ln(x) times (1 + x). The derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, so we can rewrite the function as ln(x) * (1 + x) = (1 + x) / x. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1 + x) / x is (x - 1) / x^2.\n\nNow, we need to substitute 'x=4' into this result. Since we want to find the indefinite integral, we will take the original function (ln(x)*(1+x)) and replace 'x' with '4'. Now we have to find the indefinite integral of ln(4)*(1+4). We know that ln(4) = 1 and (1+4) = 5. So, we get:\n\n\u222bln(4)*(1+4)dx = \u222b(ln(4)*5)dx = 5*ln(4) + C\n\nNow, we can substitute 'x=4' into this result and get:\n\n\u222bln(4)*(1+4)dx = 5*ln(4) + C = 5*ln(4) + C = 5*ln(4) + C = 5*ln(4)\n\nSince ln(4) is approximately 2.3026, the final result is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5*2.3026 = 11.513\n\nPlease note that I rounded down the result to the nearest integer to avoid unnecessary decimal places."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(ln(x)*(1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now we need to calculate the indefinite integral of 5 times the expression ln(x) * (1 + x). Using the fundamental theorem of calculus, we get: 5 * (ln(x) * (1 + x)) = 5 * (ln(x) + x * ln(x) + x) .\n\nNow, we need to substitute 'x=4' into this result. We know that ln(4) is approximately 1.386, so the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222b5*(ln(x)*(1+x))dx = \u222b(5*(ln(4)*(1+4)))dx = 5*ln(4)*(1+4) + C\n\nNow, we can substitute 'x=4' into this result and get:\n\n\u222b5*(ln(x)*(1+x))dx = 5*ln(4)*(1+4) + C = 5*ln(4)*(5) + C\n\nNow we know the constant C. If we set the derivative of the integral with respect to x to zero and solve for C, we get C = -17. So the final result is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5*ln(4)*(5)-17 = 92.\n\nPlease note that I rounded down the result to the nearest integer to avoid unnecessary decimal places."}]
