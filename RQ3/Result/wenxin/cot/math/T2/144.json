The indefinite integral becomes e^u. The indefinite integral of e^u is e^u + C, where C is a constant. Therefore, the final answer is: e^x + C.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we simply replace x with 4, which results in e^4 + C. To find the integer result, we need to round down the decimal to the nearest integer. This results in 7.585636865269325e+04 + C.\n\nTo find the value of C, we need to evaluate the constant term of the expression e^4 + C. This will give us a value for C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 75856\n\nPlease note that this result is approximate and may change depending on the precision you require."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x/(1/x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function 5*(e^x/(1/x)) is still quite complex, involving a derivative of the exponential function and a quotient. However, if we follow the same process as before, we can perform the substitution u = 1/x and rewrite the expression as 5*e^u.\n\nThe indefinite integral of 5*e^u is 5*e^u + C, where C is a constant. Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives us 5*e^(4/x) + C.\n\nTo find the integer result, we need to round down the decimal to the nearest integer.

The exact calculation of C will depend on the precision you require.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 19258\n\nAgain, this is approximate and may change depending on the precision you require."}]
