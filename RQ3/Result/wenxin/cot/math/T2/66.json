This substitution allows us to rewrite the function as 1/u, which is more easily integrable.\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of x/x^2 is: 1/u.\n\nNow, substituting 'x=4' into this integral, we get:\n\n\u222b(x/x^2) dx from x=4 to x=4 = \u222b(1/u) du from u=16 to u=16^2 = \u222b(1/16) d(16) = \u222b(1/16)*16^(-1) d(16) = \u222b(1/4) d(4) = \u222b4^(-1) d(4)\n\nTo further simplify this, we use the substitution 'v=4', which results in the integral \u222bv^(-1) dv. This is a common simplification for this type of problem.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \u222bv^(-1) dv = v^(-2) + C, where C is an integration constant.
