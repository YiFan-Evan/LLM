Substituting back into the original integral, we get 4 + c.\n\nSince we want to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we can set u = e^(4) = e^4, and thus, the result becomes 4 + e^4.\n\nThe final answer is: 4 + e^4.\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is an integer representing the final result after substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral of x^2/e^x."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(x^2/e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function 5*(x^2/e^x) is: 5u + c, where u = e^x.\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get: 5u + c, where u = e^4.
