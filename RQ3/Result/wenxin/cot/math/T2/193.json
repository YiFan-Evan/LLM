The function is now 5*(ln(x)^2/(1/x)). The process for calculating the indefinite integral remains the same as before: we need to find the derivative of ln(x)^2/(1/x) with respect to x, multiply by x, and then substitute 'x=4'. The indefinite integral becomes 5*(2*ln(x)*ln(ln(x)) + x*1) / x^2. Substituting 'x=4' yields 5*(2*ln(4)*ln(ln(4)) + 4*1) / 4^2 = 5*2 = 10. Therefore, the final answer is: 10."}]
