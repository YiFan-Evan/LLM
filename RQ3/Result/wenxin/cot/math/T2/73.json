So if we want to find its indefinite integral, we need to find the anti-derivative, which is the function that when differentiated will give us sinh(x).\n\nTo find the anti-derivative of sinh(x), we can use any calculus textbook's table of indefinite integrals. However, for this problem, we can use the substitution method.\n\nThe indefinite integral of sinh(x) is (1 + cos(2x))/2.\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4', we get: ((1 + cos(8))/2).\n\nTo simplify this further, we can use the identity cos(8) = 7cos^2(4) - 1. So our final expression becomes (7cos^2(4) + 1)/2.\n\nTo simplify this further still, we can use the property of square roots that (a+b)/2 = sqrt(a^2+b^2)/2 when a and b are non-negative. So our final expression becomes sqrt(7^2+1^2)/2 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sinh(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Now we have a different function: 5 * sinh(x).
