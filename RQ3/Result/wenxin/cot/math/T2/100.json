So, we can write e^(1+x) as e^x * e. Then, we can use the definition of indefinite integration to separate the integral into two parts: e^x and e. The indefinite integral of e^x is simply x * e^x, which is easy to calculate, and e can be integrated easily using its property as a constant of integration.\n\nSo, if we write down the indefinite integral as a general rule:\u222b(f(x) + C) dx = F(x) + C, then the indefinite integral of e^(1+x) becomes F(x) = e^x + C + 1, where C is an integration constant that needs to be found from the original function expression. Since the constant C doesn't enter into our result here, we can drop it.\n\nTo evaluate the indefinite integral with x=4, we just need to plug in x=4 into the F(x) equation: F(4) = e^(4*e^4) + 1. This result will give us an infinite series of terms that are dependent on e and cannot be evaluated exactly, but for our purposes, we can simplify it by truncating it to a single integer. Since we are only considering integer values here, we can approximate the result by rounding down:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2.\n\nPlease note that this is an approximation and may not be exact for all values of e."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^(1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5 * e^(1 + x) is: 5 * e^(x + 1) + C, where C is an integration constant.
