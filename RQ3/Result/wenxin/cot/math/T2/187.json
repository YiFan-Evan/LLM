The indefinite integral of a power function is the product of the function and its derivative with respect to the base. For this function, we have:\n\n\u222b(x^2^2*sinh(x^2)) dx = \u222b(x^(2+2)*sinh(x^2))' dx = x^(4)*cosh(x^2) + \u222b(x^2*cosh(x^2)) dx\n\nNow, we can simplify the second integral by using the rules of integration:\n\n\u222b(x^2*cosh(x^2)) dx = (1/2)*\u222b(x^2+x^4) dx = (1/2)*(x+x^3/3)|_0 = 4/3 + 0 = 4/3\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of x^2^2*sinh(x^2) is x^(4)*cosh(x^2) + 4/3. Now, if we substitute 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222b(4^(4)*cosh(4^(2))) + 4/3 dx = \u222b((4^(4)/3)*cosh(16) + 4/3) dx\n\nNow we need to evaluate the integral.
