To find the final answer, we need to know the value of constant 'c'.\n\nTo calculate the constant 'c', we need to integrate the function again with the same initial condition 'x=4'. The indefinite integral of the function is sinh(x)+x+c, so integrating with 'x=4' will give us c = 2.993648971435628e+02 + 4 + (4*ln(2)).
