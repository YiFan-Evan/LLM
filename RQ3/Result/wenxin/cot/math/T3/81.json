In this case, df/dx = (1 + e^x)'.\n\nThe indefinite integral is (1 + e^x) - C, where C is a constant. To isolate x, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to x and set it equal to 1. This gives us (e^x) + e^x * ln(e^x) = 1.\n\nNow, we can apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to find the indefinite integral. The fundamental theorem says that if F(x) is a function such that F(x) = F(a) + \u222b(a to x) f(t) dt, then F'(x) = f(x).\n\nIn this case, F(x) = 1 + e^x, so F'(x) = e^x + e^x * ln(e^x).\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of (1+e^x) is (e^x) + e^x * ln(e^x) - C, where C is a constant. To substitute 'x=4', we simply multiply the result by 4 and get 16 + 4ln(4) - C.\n\nTo round down to an integer, we can take the integer part of ln(4), which is approximately 2.27, and add it to 16 to get 18.
