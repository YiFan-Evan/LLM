The integrand is a quotient of two functions, so we can integrate each function separately and then multiply the results. The top function is 1/x, which is integrable using the substitution u = 1/x. We get u from x by x = 1/u, which transforms the integral into an indefinite integral of u. Then we can integrate u using the natural logarithm rule: u = ln(x^2 + 1).\n\nNow, we need to find the indefinite integral of the bottom function, which is cos(x). We can use the derivative of cos(x) = -sin(x) and integrate again to get 1/sin(x).\n\nFinally, we multiply the results and get our final answer: (ln(x^2 + 1) - 2sin(x))/x^2.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we simply replace x with 4 in our final answer. So, (ln(4^2 + 1) - 2sin(4))/4^2 = (ln(17) - 2sin(4))/16.\n\nThe final result is: Therefore, the final answer is: 7.\n\nSo far, so good. But there's one more step: remember that sin(4) is a value that could be either positive or negative, depending on the quadrant.
