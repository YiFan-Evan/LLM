Substituting 'x=4' into this expression gives us (cos(4^2) + 4) - (cos(x^2) + C). Now, let's solve for C. Since the expression involves only addition and subtraction of the same term, the constant C is just 0. Now we have (cos(4^2) + 4).\n\nLet's simplify this further by recognizing that cos(4^2) = 1 - 2 * sin(4)^2, where sin(4) is the sine of 4 degrees. We can use the trigonometric identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1 to simplify further and get 1 - 2 * sin^2(4). This is approximately 0.7635, which we can round down to get 0.
