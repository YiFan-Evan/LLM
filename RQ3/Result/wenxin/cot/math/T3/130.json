Now, if we substitute 'x=4', we get the indefinite integral as -ln(cos(4)). Since ln(cos(4)) is a real number between -\u221e and \u221e, its indefinite integral should be positive, and therefore the indefinite integral of ln(sin(x)) at x=4 is equal to 1.

Now, if we substitute 'x=4', we get the indefinite integral as 4-ln(cos(4)). The indefinite integral of a function plus a constant is equal to the constant times the derivative of the function, so we can find the derivative of ln(cos(x)) by using the chain rule and get it equals to -1/cos(x). Therefore, the derivative of x-ln(cos(x)) at x=4 is equal to 4*1/cos(4) - 1 = 3. Therefore, the final answer is: 3."}]
