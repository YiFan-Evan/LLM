This can be done using the rule for indefinite integration of a product: f(x) * g(x) = f'(x) * g(x) + f(x) * g'(x).\n\nThe indefinite integral of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of 1/x is -1/x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of e^x times (1/x) is e^x * (1/x) - e^x * (1/x^2).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we simply replace x with 4 in the indefinite integral. So, the indefinite integral becomes e^4 * (1/4) - e^4 * (1/4^2).\n\nTo simplify this further, we can use the rule that e^x = e^(ln(e^x)) = e^(ln(e) + ln(x)) = e^ln(e) * x. So, we can simplify our expression to e^(ln(e)) * (1/4) - e^(ln(e)) * (1/4^2).\n\nThe indefinite integral can be rewritten as: 1*1/4 - e^(ln(e)) / (e^(ln(e))*4). Since 1*1/4 rounds down to 1 and 1 divided by 4 rounded down is still 1, and the rest of the expression after this is already an integer (which is 4), then the final answer is: 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x*(1/x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^x times (1/x) + x is equal to e^x times (1/x) + x + C, where C is a constant.
