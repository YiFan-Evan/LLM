The indefinite integral will be the original function minus a constant, which we will find by substituting x=4 into the result.\n\nFirst, we need to find the derivative of sinh(x). It's:\n\nd(sinh(x)) = (sinh(x) + cosh(x)) * (1/sqrt(1 - (cosh(x))^2))\n\nNext, we use the derivative of sinh(x) in the indefinite integral of cos(sinh(x)).

We get:\n\n-sin(sinh(4)) + c\n\nTo find c, we use the substitution that cosh(4) = 7.779472067654395 and (cosh(4))^2 - 1 = 64. We then find that sin(sinh(4)) = 0.1637633336665638.
