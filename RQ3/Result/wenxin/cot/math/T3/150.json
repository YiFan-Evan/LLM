The indefinite integral of e^x*sin(x) is e^x*sin(x)+C, where C is an arbitrary constant, and the indefinite integral of x is x. Therefore, the indefinite integral of the function e^x*sin(x)+x is e^x*sin(x)+x+C. Now, to substitute 'x=4', we simply need to replace x with 4 in the indefinite integral, and add a constant C to make the result integer. Let's choose C=1 to make the indefinite integral of the function e^x*sin(x)+x equal to 4*e^(4)*sin(4)+4. Therefore, the final result is: 4*e^(4)*sin(4)+4.
