Since sinh(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / 2, we can approximate it with e^(x^2)*sin(x^2). Now, let's consider the factor x^2^2: we need to take its power down to 2 by applying the distributive law, which is equal to (x^2)^2 / 2. So, we have the final indefinite integral:\n\n\u222b(e^(x^2)*sin(x^2)*(x^2)^2 / 2) dx\n\n= (e^(x^2)*sin(x^2)*(x^2)^2) / 2 + C\n\nThe constant C can be set to zero because it is not needed for the indefinite integral.\n\nNow, let's substitute 'x=4' into this result:\n\n\u222b(e^(4^2)*sin(4^2)*(4^2)^2 / 2) dx = (e^(64)*sin(64)*(64)^2 / 2)\n\n= (e^(64)*sin(64)*3073)\n\nWe need to evaluate this result.
