This substitution allows us to rewrite the function as u^2/u, which is much easier to integrate. The indefinite integral becomes u + c, where c is a constant. To find the value of c, we can integrate again to get 1/u + c', where c' is another constant. Then, we can substitute u = 1 + x to get the final result: 1/(x+1) + c'' for some other constant c''.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -4.\n\nTo find the value of x = 4, we can plug it into the expression: -4.
