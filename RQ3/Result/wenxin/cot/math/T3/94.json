To find the value of 'x=4', we need to substitute 4 for x and get e^(4^2)+4+C.\n\nTo simplify the process, we can approximate the indefinite integral by taking the first term e^(4^2) as 168.37 and adding it to the constant C. This gives us a result of 168.37+C.\n\nNow, to find the value of 'x=4' in this expression, we simply need to add 4 to the constant C. Therefore, we get C=168.37-4=164.37.
