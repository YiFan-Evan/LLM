Using the rules of calculus, we know that the derivative of x^2 is 2x * x, which is also x^2. Therefore, we can isolate the integral of x^2 by subtracting x^2 from the integrand, leaving us with: 1 + x. The indefinite integral of 1 + x is 1/dx + x.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply need to replace x with 4. Therefore, the result becomes: 1/4 + 4 = 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: x^2*(1+x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of x^2*(1+x)+x is: 1/dx * (x^2*(1+x)+x) = 1/dx * (x^3 + x^2 + x) = 1/dx * x^3 + x + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get: 1/4 * (4^3) + 4 + C = 64 + 4 + C. Now, we need to find the integer value of C. Let's consider two possible cases: If C is positive, it would be 68. If C is negative, it would be -68. Therefore, the final answer is: 68 or -68."}]
