Now, for x=4, we need to substitute x=4 into the indefinite integral, which will result in the evaluation of the function at x=4. To do this, we need to multiply the indefinite integral by 4. The indefinite integral is 1/x, so if we multiply by 4, we get 4/x. Now, plugging x=4 into this expression, we get 4/4 = 1. Therefore, the final answer is: Therefore, the final answer is: 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of (1/x) + x, we can simply integrate the denominator and the numerator separately, like this: \u222b(1/x) = ln(x) + C1 and \u222bx = x + C2. Then, you need to substitute 'x=4' into both C2 and the function at C1 to get a result for 'x=4'. Substituting 'x=4' into C2 gives you 4 + C2, which is 4 + whatever C2 was. Substituting 'x=4' into the function at C1 gives you ln(4) + whatever C1 was. Now, you need to find out what C1 and C2 were by adding them together. You can do this by subtracting C2 from 4 + C2, which leaves you with C1. Therefore, the final answer is: Therefore, the final answer is: 4 + the indefinite integral of (1/x) at x=4. To find this, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral of (1/x) at x=4, which is ln(4). Therefore, the final result is: 4 + ln(4). The answer is an integer, so it needs to be rounded down. Therefore, the final answer is: 5."}]
