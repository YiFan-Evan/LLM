Start by recognizing that the indefinite integral of e^x*x^2+x involves both exponentials, polynomial functions, and a linear function. To find the indefinite integral, you need to consider how to expand the expression, multiply each term, and apply the integration rules for each term.\n\n2. Expanding e^x*x^2+x, you get e^x*(x^2 + x) + x.\n\n3. The indefinite integral of each term in the expanded expression is a separate step. For example, for the term e^x*(x^2 + x), you need to integrate e^x and x^2 + x separately. The indefinite integral of x^2 is 2*x*ln(x) and the indefinite integral of x is just a constant, which I'll call C. Therefore, the indefinite integral of e^x*(x^2 + x) becomes (e^x)*ln(x) + (2*e^x)*x + C.\n\n4. Adding C to both sides and simplifying, you get (e^x)*ln(x) + 2*(e^x)*x = (e^x)*ln(e^x) + 2*(e^x)*4 = 5*e^4.\n\n5.
