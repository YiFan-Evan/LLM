Recognize that the function ln(x) is the natural logarithm of x, which is a piecewise function with base e, while sinh(x) is the hyperbolic sine of x, which is defined for positive x only. Therefore, the indefinite integral would involve two different functions with different ranges of values.\n\n2. For this function, we can use the chain rule to simplify the integral. ln(x) is a derivative of 1/x, so we can write ln(x)/sinh(x) as (1/x)/sinh(x) + C, where C is a constant.\n\n3. To calculate the indefinite integral, we need to integrate (1/x)/sinh(x) + C with respect to x. We can use the definition of indefinite integration to simplify this expression further:\n\n\u222b(1/x)/sinh(x) dx = -cosh(x)/x^2 + C\n\n4. To find the value of x=4, we substitute 4 into the indefinite integral. We get -cosh(4)/4^2 + C.\n\n5. To simplify this expression further, we can use the properties of hyperbolic functions and constants to get rid of the cosh term. The indefinite integral gives us -cosh(4)/4^2 + C = -cosh(4) + 4^2*C. Since cosh(4) is always greater than or equal to 1 (for positive x), we can simplify further to get -4*C = 1, which means C = -1/4. Therefore, the final result is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -3.\n\nTo check this result, we can plug it back into the indefinite integral to verify that it gives us ln(4)/sinh(4), which is approximately 0.999655395058583.
