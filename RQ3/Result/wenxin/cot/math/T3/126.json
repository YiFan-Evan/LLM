The result will be (e^4 + 4) + c.\n\nWe can find the value of c by setting the derivative of the function with respect to x to 0, which would mean that we need to calculate the derivative of e^x * e^x + x and equate it to 0 when x = 4. This derivative is (2 * e^x * e^x + 1), which when evaluated at x = 4 equals 26.
