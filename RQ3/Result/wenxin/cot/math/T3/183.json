[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

The indefinite integral of cos(e^x) is -sin(e^x) + C, and the indefinite integral of sin(e^x) is e^x * cos(e^x) + C. So the indefinite integral of the function is -sin(e^x) * e^x * cos(e^x) + C * e^x + D, where C and D are constants. To find the value of x=4, we need to substitute x=4 into the indefinite integral. After some simplification, we get -sin(4) * 4 * cos(4) + C * 4^2 + D = -4*sqrt(2)*sin(4) + 8*C + D. To find the integer result, we need to round down the value of C. Since there are only two options for C, it will be either 1 or -3, so the integer result is 1 for either case. Therefore, the final answer is: -4*sqrt(2)*sin(4)+8.\n\nOK.\n\nNow, let's take a look at another problem: x^3 * ln(x) / x^2.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of x^3 * ln(x) / x^2, we can use the quotient rule of integration. The indefinite integral of x^3 * ln(x) is (3/2)*x^2 * ln(x) + x^3 * (1/2)*exp(x)/x + C, and the indefinite integral of 1/x is -exp(x)/x^2 + C. So the indefinite integral of the function is (3/2)*x^2 * ln(x) - x^(3+2)*exp(x)/4 + D, where D is a constant. To find the value of x=4, we need to substitute x=4 into the indefinite integral. After some simplification, we get (3/2)*4^2 * ln(4) - 64*exp(4)/4 + D = 6*ln(4) - 64 + D. To find the integer result, we need to round down the value of D. Since there are only two options for D, it will be either 0 or 1, so the integer result is 5 for either case. Therefore, the final answer is: 5*ln(4)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: cos(e^x)*sin(e^x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(e^x) * sin(e^x) + x, we can use the sum rule of integration.
