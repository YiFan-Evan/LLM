This C is a constant term that doesn't affect the integral of x (which is what we are after). Now, if we substitute 'x=4' into this expression, we get: sin(ln(4)) + C. We can approximate the value of ln(4) by taking the natural log of 4 (2) and subtracting it from infinity (because ln(Infinity) = Infinity). This gives us 2 - infinity which is approximately -1.59. So, if we add this to our constant term C, we get the result: sin(-1.59) + C.\n\nSince the sin function has an infinite number of solutions for -1.59, the exact value will depend on what value of C we choose. But for simplicity, let's just round down to the nearest integer and call it 0.
