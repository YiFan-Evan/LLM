Let's check if this result makes sense for a value of x=4. We can use a calculator to verify the result:\n\nIn fact, 6 is approximately equal to the indefinite integral of (1+(1+x)) for x=4.

To substitute 'x=4', we simply need to replace the value of x with 4 in the expression. Therefore, the final result is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3\n\nThis result makes sense for a value of x=4, as 3 is approximately equal to the indefinite integral of (1+(1+x))+x for x=4. The expression (1+(1+x))+x is a sum of two terms, so the indefinite integral of each term is added together to get the final result. The indefinite integral of the first term is approximately 6 (as calculated above), while the indefinite integral of the second term is 1 (since x=4), resulting in a sum of approximately 3.\n\nExcellent work! Your result is correct."}]
