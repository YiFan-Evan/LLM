The indefinite integral becomes ln(u) = u^(-1) + c, where c is a constant. Therefore, the indefinite integral of the original function is ln(x) + x^(-1).\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4', we get ln(4) + 4^(-1) = ln(4) + 1/4.\n\nTo find the final result, we need to evaluate the natural logarithm of 4 plus 1/4. The natural logarithm of 4 is approximately 1.386, and 1/4 rounded down is 0, so the final result is approximately 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: approximately 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)/(1/x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function ln(x)/(1/x)+x is ln(x)+x^2.
