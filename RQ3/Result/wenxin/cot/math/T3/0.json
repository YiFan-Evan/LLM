To do this, we need to multiply the result by 4 and add it to the constant C. The result will be an integer number representing the final result.\n\nThe function e^x is a very special function, because it is an exponential function, which means that it grows very quickly as x increases. Therefore, the indefinite integral at x=4 will be a very large number.\n\nTo find the final result, we need to simplify the expression and find the integer part of the result. To do this, we can rewrite the expression as ln(e^4) + 4C and simplify it to: ln(e^4).
