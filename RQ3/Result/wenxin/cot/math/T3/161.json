To do this, we will use the definition of indefinite integration, which is finding the sum of a function and its antiderivative. In this case, the derivative of the function is:\n\n\n```css\nf(x) = -cos(x)/x^2 * e^x + sin(x)/x\n```\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of the function is:\n\n\n```scss\n\u222b (1/x) * sin(x) / e^x dx = -cos(x) / x^2 * e^x + ln(x) * e^(-x) + C\n```\nHere, C is a constant of integration, which we won't be considering for our specific problem. Substituting 'x = 4' into this expression gives us:\n\n\n```scss\n\u222b (1/4) * sin(4) / e^(4) dx = -cos(4) / (4^2) * e^(4) + ln(4) * e^(-4) + C\n```\nSimplifying the result further gives:\n\n\n```scss\n= -0.5599667833569253 * e^(4) - ln(4) / 4 - C\n```\nThe final answer is: **-0.5599667833569253**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)*sin(x)/e^x+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function (1/x) * sin(x) / e^x + x is:\n\n\u222b (1/x) * sin(x) / e^x dx = -cos(x) / x^2 * e^x + ln(x) * e^(-x) + C\n\nSubstituting 'x = 4' into this expression gives us:\n\n\u222b (1/4) * sin(4) / e^(4) + 4 dx = -cos(4) / (4^2) * e^(4) + ln(4) * e^(-4) + C\n\nSimplifying the result further gives:\n\n-0.5599667833569253 * e^4 + ln(4)\n\nThe final answer is: **-5**."}]
