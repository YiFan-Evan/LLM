So, 1/x is just the product of 1/(x-a) (a = \u221e), so the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(1/(1+x)) d(1/x) = ln(1+x) + C (constant of integration)\n\nSubstituting x=4 in the above result, we get:\n\nln(1+4) + C = ln(5) + C\n\nSince we don't know the constant of integration C, we can't give you the final answer right now. However, we can approximate it by considering that ln(4) is close to 2 and 2 is a good approximation for the indefinite integral. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nln(5) - ln(4) \u2248 ln(5) - ln(4) = \u2248 1\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \u2248 1.\n\nNote: The constant of integration C varies depending on the initial conditions of the integration and the actual values of x.

The final result is obtained by considering the behavior of the logarithm near infinity. The numerator 4^2 + 4 + 1 is approximately 20, and since the denominator of the logarithm is much larger than the numerator, we can approximate the result by replacing it with its Taylor series. This results in ln(20) = 3.32.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \u2248 3.\n\nNote: This approximation is valid only for very large values of x (i.e., when x > 0 and x is a significant fraction of a value close to infinity).
