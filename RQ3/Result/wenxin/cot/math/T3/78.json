Integrate the numerator and denominator separately using standard rules for integration of exponential functions.\n\nAfter integration, we get: -1/(ln(x)) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we need to replace ln(x) with its value at x=4, which is ln(4). So, the expression becomes: -1/(ln(4)) + C.\n\nTo simplify further, we can use the property of the natural logarithm again: ln(e^x) = x.
