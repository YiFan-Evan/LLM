Of these options, only D. pay attention is directly related to actively listening to a lecture and paying attention to the content. Gaining confidence and getting attention are not directly related to actively listening, but rather to the overall performance or self-esteem of the listener. Concentrating is also related to actively listening, but it does not explicitly answer the question of what the goal of actively listening is. Therefore, the correct answer is paying attention."}]
