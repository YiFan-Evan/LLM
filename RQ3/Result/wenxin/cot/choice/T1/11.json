Stop worrying. Stopping worrying is a key factor in relaxation, as it allows the mind to clear and focus on other things, such as listening to music or doing other relaxing activities. Going to bed is also a form of relaxation, but it does not necessarily provide the mind with a clear and relaxing state of mind. Listening to music, checking mail, and finding time are not commonly associated with relaxation at night."}]
