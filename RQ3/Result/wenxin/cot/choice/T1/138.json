Therefore, the correct option is E, \"do enjoy\". This option is the most appropriate because it suggests that you have fun while doing something, which is what the question is asking for. Pay for and stop working are not relevant options in this context, while \"do like\" does not quite capture the idea of enjoying something. \"Spontaneous\" is related to doing something without much planning or preparation, but does not directly imply enjoying something."}]
