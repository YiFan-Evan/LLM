Shows and hockey games may have their own ways of expressing appreciation, but generally speaking, audiences clap for the theatre. As per your original options, it's clear that \"cinema\" and \"movies\" do not have an activity for audiences to clap for at the end of the movie or screening, and show is very generic and does not give specific clapping activities, so that doesn't apply here.
