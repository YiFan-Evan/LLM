The correct answer is D. Clothing stores. As tweed is a rare fabric, it is best to look for options in clothing stores where one can compare different brands and styles before making a purchase decision. Although Eddie Bauer is a well-known brand in the clothing industry that sells high-quality clothing items, clothing stores provide more variety and allow buyers to select brands that best suit their tastes and budgets. Scotland, on the other hand, is not related to tweed directly. Brown is also not an appropriate option as it is not related to tweed specifically. Fabric store is a type of store that sells various types of fabric, but not necessarily tweed. Therefore, the best option for buying tweed is D. Clothing stores."}]
