If he has a vehicle, he wouldn't need a bag for transporting his belongings, and using a locker room wouldn't require him to walk around with a duffel bag.

Transit\n\nTransit is the most suitable choice among the provided options because it involves traveling between two places by different modes of transportation such as public transportation, walking, etc. James doesn't have a vehicle of his own and needs a bag to carry his things while he travels from one place to another, so he's carrying a duffel bag with him and going through transit. If he has a vehicle, he wouldn't need a bag for transporting his belongings and using a library, army barracks, or bus station as an answer would also make little sense because libraries and army barracks usually don't require travelers to bring bags for transportation. Since it is mentioned that he is carrying a duffel bag, using a locker room as an answer doesn't make sense because it doesn't require a person to carry bags."}]
