However, if there is only one person speaking, then the most likely place to hold such an event would be a university campus, where classrooms or lecture halls are often used for individual presentations or discussions. Lights and a park might be suitable settings for individual speaking events, but they are not as commonly used for this purpose as a university campus. No crowd would be present at an auditorium with only one person speaking, as there would be no audience to speak to.
