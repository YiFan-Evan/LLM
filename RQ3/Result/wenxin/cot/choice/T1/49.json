The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately describe how he felt in the situation. E. panic indicates that he was experiencing anxiety or distress due to the crowds, which is not what is stated in the question. Similarly, D. solitude is a positive attribute that cannot accurately describe his feelings of loneliness and disconnectedness, while A. small group indicates that he was experiencing a small crowd which would not cause him to feel lonely or disconnected from others. C. solitary suggests that he was experiencing loneliness and feeling disconnected from others, which is the most accurate option given the question."}]
