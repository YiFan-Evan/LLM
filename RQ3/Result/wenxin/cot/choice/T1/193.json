Sporting goods store.\n\nA sporting goods store is a store that sells various types of sports equipment, such as balls, bats, shoes, clothing, and more. This type of store is typically found in areas where there is a high concentration of sports enthusiasts or where sports are popular.

An office supply store would have writing instruments and office supplies, not sports equipment. A school typically has sports equipment and supplies for its students and athletes, but it is typically purchased by the school and not available for sale to the general public. A sporting event would be a one-time event and not a store.
