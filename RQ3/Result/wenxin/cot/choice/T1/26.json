Smoke. Smoke could prevent a driving car from continuing to drive if it is caused by a malfunctioning engine or other mechanical issues with the car. This is because smoke is often a sign of a problem with the car's engine that could prevent it from running properly. In contrast, the other options listed (low fuel tank, pollution, and backache) are not directly related to preventing a car from continuing to drive."}]
