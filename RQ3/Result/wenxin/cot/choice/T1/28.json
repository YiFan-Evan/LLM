This does not mean that those who are unable to work, are dead, or no longer exist cannot go to heaven, but rather that baptism and a genuine conversion experience are the primary criteria for entry.

Born Again.\n\nThe question specifically mentions that Christians believe you will go to heaven if you have a certain condition, and that condition is to be born again. This implies that becoming a Christian, having a conversion experience, and following the teachings of Christianity are prerequisites for entry into heaven. Being unable to work, dead, or no longer existing are not related to this criterion, while change of color is not mentioned in the question and is not a valid option."}]
