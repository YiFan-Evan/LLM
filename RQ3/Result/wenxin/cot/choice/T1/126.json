We ask a child to dress herself when we first meet her. This is because dressing oneself is a basic skill that children need to learn. It helps them develop independence and self-confidence. In contrast, asking questions, counting to ten, or asking for a costume are not directly related to the task of dressing oneself.

The correct answer is \"D. state name\". When meeting a child for the first time, it is typical to ask them their name, as it is a basic introduction that helps establish a connection and allows you to know the child better. Costume, count to ten, and ask questions are not directly related to the task of introducing oneself, but rather are more related to activities or interactions within a social setting. Therefore, the final answer is: state name."}]
