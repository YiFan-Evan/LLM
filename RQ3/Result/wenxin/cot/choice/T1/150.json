The correct option is A. Stall. The question was asking about what happens when an airplane engine cuts off and is unable to be restarted in flight. When this occurs, the airplane loses lift and its speed slows down, resulting in a stall. This stall can lead to a loss of altitude and a potential crash if not handled properly. The other options provided in the question are not directly related to what happens when an airplane engine cuts off and is unable to be restarted in flight."}]
