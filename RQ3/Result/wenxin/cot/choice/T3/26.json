The correct answer is E.\n\nAs stated in the question, low fuel tank is the most likely reason that could prevent a driving car from continuing to drive. It is essential for a car to have fuel to run and if the fuel level is low, it may not be able to continue driving. Other options like automobile accidents, backache, pollution and smoke are unrelated to the issue of fuel level and do not provide a direct explanation as to why a car may not be able to continue driving."}]
