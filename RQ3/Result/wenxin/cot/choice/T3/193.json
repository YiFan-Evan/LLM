Sporting goods store.\n\nA sporting goods store is a store that sells various types of sports equipment, such as balls, bats, skis, helmets, etc. This type of store is often found in shopping centers or streets, and typically attracts a large number of customers interested in various sports. The other options are less likely to have sports equipment in abundance. A mall might have a few sports shops but they would not have everything under one roof. An office supply store is not designed for the sale of sports equipment, and a sporting event is a temporary event and not a permanent store. Therefore, the most suitable option is a sporting goods store."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What type of store would have lots of sports equipment?
