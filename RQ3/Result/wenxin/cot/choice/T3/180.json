The type of keyboard that is made up of one or more pipe divisions is typically a terminal keyboard, which is commonly used in command-line interfaces for operating systems like Unix or Linux. These keyboards typically have special keys for entering commands or operating system functions, and they are often divided into sections or \"pipes\" to help users navigate through the command line interface.
