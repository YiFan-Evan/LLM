It is a common practice among friends to meet up at each other's houses to consume alcohol, especially beer. Refrigerator, keg and neighbor's house are not suitable options because they do not provide a place to consume beer. Kitchen is a place where food is prepared and consumed, not a place where beer is consumed.

(Since 'large_distance' is a reason-word for the model's decision-making, it suggests that the model believes the place where you can consume beer is far away from your house. Therefore, 'neighbor's house' may be the predicted option because it is a location that is not too far from your house and serves as a convenient place to consume beer.)\nOptions: A. refrigerator B. friend's house C. keg D. neighbor's house E. kitchen"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the question and the reasoning provided, the predicted answer is \"neighbor's house\". The question mentions a place that is far away from the house and where beer can be consumed. Since \"large_distance\" is a reason-word used by the model, it suggests that the model believes the place where beer can be consumed is indeed far away from the house. Therefore, \"neighbor's house\" is a logical choice because it is a location that is not too far from the house and serves as a convenient place to consume beer. In addition, it also avoids providing a direct answer that is too close to home, considering the context of the question."}]
