However, it's not entirely clear why Michigan specifically was chosen over other options such as Florida, Texas, or wine. Based on the reasoning words provided (\"brighton_mass\", \"day\", \"analgesic\", \"get_off\", \"minuscule\"), it's possible that Michigan may have been chosen because of its high beef production or related industries, which could provide a suitable supply of beef for a steakhouse. However, without more information about the specifics of the model's reasoning, it's difficult to be certain. In any case, it's generally agreed that having a suitable building is the first step in opening a restaurant, so the correct answer is E. building."}]
