This is because the Apache helicopter is a hybrid vehicle that uses both electric and internal combustion engines to power its various components. The electric motor is used to power the rotor, which is the main propulsion system of the helicopter."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: George checked the rotor of the Apache, which wasn't powered by internal combustion, but by what? (Since the reason-words \"flame_photometry, main_shock, propterygial, slinky, internal\" do not relate to any of the potential choices except for \"electric motor\", the model predicts that George checked the rotor of the Apache which wasn't powered by internal combustion, but by an electric motor.)\nOptions: A. jet engine B. helicopter C. electric motor D. rotator E. electrical circuit"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Therefore, the final answer is: C. electric motor.\n\nAs per the question, George checked the rotor of the Apache, which was powered by something other than internal combustion.
