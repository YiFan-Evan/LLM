(The model predicts that an unsuccessful suicide attempt may result in the person still being alive (i.e. not dying). This is because the top reason-words \"sad_story, back_to_front, succor, attempter, broken_limbs\" suggest that there may be underlying emotional or physical issues that are causing the individual to attempt suicide. Additionally, the word 'attempter' specifically implies that the individual has not fully succeeded in their attempt.
