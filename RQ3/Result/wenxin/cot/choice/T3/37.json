Direct sunlight.\n\nJenny was not provided with shade, so she was forced to lie there exposed to direct sunlight. She was not in a sunny place, nor was she in bright sunshine or full sunlight. She was not eating cake. So, the answer to the question is direct sunlight. She might not have been comfortable lying in direct sunlight and would have wished for some shade or a tree. However, that's not in the question, hence she had to lay there.

Direct sunlight.\n\nThe question provided information that Jenny was not provided with shade, so she was forced to lie there exposed to direct sunlight. The provided options are not relevant to the question. Bright sunshine and full sunlight are not necessarily harmful or dangerous to health, and sunny place does not specify if there is direct sunlight or not.
