However, it does not directly answer the question of what happened because the question was asking about his actions and resulting effect.\n- Option B: Dying does not make sense because this would indicate a negative outcome but he was actively trying to procreate, not to commit suicide.\n- Option C: Kissing could indicate a friendly gesture during sexual activity but does not answer the question.\n- Option E: Sanity refers to a person's mental state, which is not related to his actions during sexual activity.\n\nTherefore, the only option that fits the question is D, which refers to contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD).
