(Since monkeys are native to the African continent, they are likely to enjoy being in natural environments, such as a mulberry bush. Additionally, the mention of the word \"orange\" could be associated with the fruit being in close proximity to a natural environment, further reinforcing this choice. However, the mention of \"cage_in_zoo\" and \"disloyal\" suggests that the monkey may not enjoy being in a captive or unnatural environment, such as a research laboratory, sailor suit, or theatre.
