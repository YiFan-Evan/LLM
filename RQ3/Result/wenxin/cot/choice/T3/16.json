Roads are the most common place for cars to travel at very high speeds. Freeways are special roads that are designed for high-speed traffic and have a smooth surface and controlled traffic flow. However, other options such as race tracks, alleys and parking lots are usually not used for high-speed traffic. Therefore, the final answer is: A.

The reason why cars need to pass other cars at high speeds is that they are designed for high-speed traffic and have a smooth surface and controlled traffic flow.
