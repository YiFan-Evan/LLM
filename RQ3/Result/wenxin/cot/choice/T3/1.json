Small towns often have many local restaurants, so you can go to one between 1,000 and 10,000 restaurant in a small town. A big city usually has many restaurants but most of them are not in this range, whereas Canada is a country with a lot of natural scenery and restaurants. Yellow pages are also an option, but it doesn't specifically indicate that the restaurants are within a certain range of 1,000 to 10,000.
