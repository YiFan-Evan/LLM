Plains are usually flat and have no significant incline or declivity, and so it is not possible for them to reach the ocean. Therefore, the final answer is: \"Therefore, the final answer is: A. mountain\". Option B, C, D and E do not make sense in this context as they are not related to a plain that reached the ocean and couldn't go any further.
