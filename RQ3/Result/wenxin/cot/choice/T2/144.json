This implies that he was actively trying to listen to the testimony and not just passively do nothing. Nodding, taking notes and writing down do not fully express that effort to listen actively. The other options do not accurately reflect the answer either. For example, changing of heart suggests a change of mind and does not have any relevance to this question.
