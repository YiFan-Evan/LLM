Ink in. Ink is a liquid that is used to write on paper and it will prevent the pen from drying out. Caps are used to cover the pen to prevent ink from leaking out, but they do not prevent the pen from drying out. Cling film is a type of plastic wrap that can be used to cover items to prevent moisture loss, but it is not suitable for protecting pens.

Ink in a pen is a practical and common method of doing this because it keeps the pen wet and prevents it from drying out. Therefore, the final answer is: B. Ink in. \n\nThe other options such as Cling film, caps, and ink cartridges do not serve this purpose. Cling film does not work as a way to prevent a pen from drying out, while caps are primarily used to keep the ink inside the pen, not to prevent it from drying out. Ink cartridges only hold ink, and writing on paper with the pen may still allow moisture to escape from the pen, leading to drying out."}]
