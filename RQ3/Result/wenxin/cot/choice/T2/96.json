If one does not notice spitting, it could result in excess saliva, which can lead to phlegm production. This is because saliva contains water, enzymes, and mucus, and excess production can result in dryness or congestion. On the other hand, diseases are a condition that is either present from birth or acquired over time and require medical attention. Germs are microorganisms that cause infections, and spittle is excess saliva droplets. Therefore, if someone spits without noticing, they may have extra phlegm. Therefore, the final answer is: A. phlegm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: If i were to spit a lot without noticing i may have extra what?\nOptions: A. spittle B. germs C. disease D. saliva nd mouth E. phlegm"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer according to the question is E.
