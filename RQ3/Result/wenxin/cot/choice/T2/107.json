None of the other options mentioned in the question applies to what happens at birth. A is incorrect because it refers to expiration of time, not birth. B is incorrect because it talks about aging, which is a process that occurs over time, not at birth. C is incorrect because it talks about bad things that may happen, which is not applicable to birth.

Expiration refers to the process of stopping of bodily functions due to ageing and is incorrect as a possible answer. Growth refers to gradual physical changes over time, which also is not relevant here. Death refers to ceasing of life, which is not the answer at birth.
