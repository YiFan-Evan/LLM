It would be unusual to put coins into a jar or any other container without further explanation or specific context, whereas a desk is typically used for writing or studying, not for storing coins. A water fountain is for drinking water, not for storing coins. An E is not a valid option because it does not provide any information about what item would be used to store coins."}]
