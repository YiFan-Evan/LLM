The options provided are: A. important when traveling, B. cabinet, C. electrical circuit, and D. library. While the first option is not related to purchasing maps, the other three options are not the best place to buy maps, as libraries and cabinets typically do not have a wide variety of maps available, and electrical circuits are not a place to purchase items. On the other hand, bookstores typically have a wide variety of maps and travel guides available for purchase, making it the most logical and practical option to get maps that one owns. Therefore, the correct answer is E. bookstore."}]
