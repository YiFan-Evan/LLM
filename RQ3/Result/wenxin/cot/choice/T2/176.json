A single shower curtain would be found in a shower stall since shower stalls are designed to accommodate one person and use a single shower curtain to protect against water spraying outside of the stall. None of the other options make sense as a single shower curtain would not be found in a department store, nor is it common for people to have a bathtub or wash in a washing area with a single shower curtain. The hotel would have multiple showers, so a single shower curtain wouldn't make sense there. Therefore, the final answer is B. shower stall."}]
