Getting tired, exhaustion, sweating and falling down are all possible reasons for someone to stop running abruptly. However, in this question, the option E is different as it specifically mentions the word \"mushroom\". It is unlikely that someone is stopped abruptly by a mushroom. Therefore, all options other than E can be eliminated from the list and only the option D is left as the correct answer."}]
