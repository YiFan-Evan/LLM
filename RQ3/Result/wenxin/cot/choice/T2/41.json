When the child didn't understand what was happening around him, he probably thought that it was all a pretend situation and it was all just a dream. Therefore, he daydreamed and didn't believe that it was real. The other options, such as religion, laughter, and transcendentalism do not seem to be the right answer as they are not related to the child's feeling and thought process.\n\nExample: Suppose you see a film in a theatre, and at the end, you realize that it was just a dream sequence, then you will also say that you are having daydreams, even if you don't believe in dreams as real or as important. This fits into the child's situation where he is unsure about the realism of the events happening around him and believes it is just a pretend world.\n\nAnswer: This question refers to a situation where a child didn't understand something. When a child thinks it's just pretend, he usually means he doesn't believe it's real. Therefore, the answer is D. daydreams."}]
