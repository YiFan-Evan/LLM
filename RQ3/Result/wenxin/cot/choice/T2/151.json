Grouping together or understanding each other may not be practical or possible in certain situations, while meeting for lunch or parting ways may not be the primary focus of the help requested.

While options B and D suggest actions related to getting together, C and B suggest a more complicated process, and D does not have a direct reference to helping each other, only group together is relevant to helping friends by offering assistance when needed.
