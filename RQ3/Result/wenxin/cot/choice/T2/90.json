The other options, such as a dishwasher, a water fountain, a sand box, or a toilet, are not typically used for storing or accessing drinking cups.

Toilet.\n\nThe question specifically mentions \"normally\", which suggests that it's not a case-by-case scenario, but a general rule. It's unlikely that you would take a cup from a toilet to drink from, especially in a public or social setting. The other options are kitchen cabinet, water fountain, and dishwasher, which are more likely places to find drinking cups. Therefore, the most logical answer is B. Toilet."}]
