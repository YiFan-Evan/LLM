A folding chair is commonly used on beaches for sitting, relaxing or sheltering from the sun, so it would make sense to use one on the beach without storing it somewhere else. Garage, closet and city hall are not suitable places to use a folding chair, while school is a suitable place for storing folding chairs, not using them."}]
