Sporting goods store.\n\nA sporting goods store is a store that sells various types of sports equipment, such as balls, bats, skis, and other sports-related items.

A school would have sports equipment for its own use, but it would not have a store dedicated to selling sports equipment to the general public. Therefore, the best option is a sporting goods store, which would have a wide variety of sports equipment for sale."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What type of store would have lots of sports equipment?\nOptions: A. sporting event B. sporting goods store C. school D. office supply store E. mall"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Therefore, the final answer is: B.
