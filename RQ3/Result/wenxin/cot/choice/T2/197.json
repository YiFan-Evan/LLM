Having fun. Ball games are fun and you try to have a good time while playing. Losing and winning are secondary goals and not the main focus of playing ball. Winning may result in increased competitiveness, which is not what I want while playing ball. Losing is an outcome of playing and should be avoided, hence both winning and losing are not suitable answers for the question. Hence, having fun is the main objective while playing ball."}]
