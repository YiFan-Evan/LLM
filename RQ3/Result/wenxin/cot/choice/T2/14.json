Punctured. If a basketball has a hole in it but does not lose its general shape, it means it still retains its original shape and form, despite having a hole. However, if it is punctured, it would be true as the ball would lose its general shape and be damaged as the air would leak out through the hole.

Round is a characteristic of a basketball, not a flaw that would cause it to lose its general shape if it had a hole in it. If a basketball had a hole in it but did not lose its general shape, it could still be round, so the answer is E. The other options given in the options do not provide a reason why a basketball with a hole in it would not lose its general shape."}]
