The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`member_value_i = arr[id_i]`\n\nHere's my thought process and conclusion:\n\n* At the start of each iteration, we initialize `member_value` to -1 and `s` to 0. `s` is used to iterate through the array, and `member_value` is used to track the value of the member we are looking for.\n* If `s` equals `id`, we know that we have found the member we are looking for, so we set `member_value` to the value at index `s` in the array.\n* After each iteration, `s` is incremented by 1, moving to the next element in the array.\n* Once we have finished the loop, `member_value` will contain the value of the member with ID `id`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is `member_value_i = arr[id_i]`.
