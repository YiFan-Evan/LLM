The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n\n```less\nmid_value_i = arr[i]\nd_i = i\n```\nHere's my thought process:\n\n1. We start by setting `mid_value_i` to the first element of the array, `arr[0]`.\n2. We also initialize `d_i` to the current index `i` because it will be used later to index into the array.\n3. We enter the while loop as long as `2 * d_i < len(arr)` is true. This condition ensures that we don't go past the end of the array.\n4. Inside the loop, we keep moving `mid_value_i` to the next element in the array by using `arr[d_i]` and incrementing `d_i` by 1.\n5. After finishing the loop, `mid_value_i` will hold the median value of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is `mid_value_i = arr[i]` and `d_i = i`.
