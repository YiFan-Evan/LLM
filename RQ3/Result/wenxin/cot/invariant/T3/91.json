[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Then, the loop iterates over the array elements (`arr[l]` for each `l` from 1 to the length of the array), updating `last_value` with each iteration.

Then, the loop decrements the array length `l` by 1 at each iteration, and updates `first_value` with the element at the index `l`.
