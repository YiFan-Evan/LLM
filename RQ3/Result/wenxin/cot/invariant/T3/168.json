The outer loop iterates over each element in the array.\n2. Inside the outer loop, we start a new inner loop, which will iterate until we find the position of the i-th element.\n3. In this inner loop, we compare the element at position z with the element before it. If it's greater than the previous element, we swap them and move z one position backward.\n4. This process continues until we reach the end of the array, or until we find the correct position for the i-th element.\n5. At this point, we can assert that the elements in positions i and higher are sorted in ascending order.\n6. Therefore, the final answer is: The insertion sort algorithm maintains the invariant that `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[j] for all j < i` for each iteration of the outer loop. This proves the partial correctness of the program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        i -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728while\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\uff0ci\u7684\u503c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c0f\u52300\u4ee5\u4e0b\u3002\u5426\u5219\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7ed3\u675f\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a0b\u5e8f\u51fa\u9519\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 1\n    while i <= len(arr):\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u65f6\u90fd\u4f1a\u628a\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u5230\u5b83\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u540e\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u5c31\u4f1a\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
