Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly inserts a new element into the correct position in a sorted list.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i-1] <= arr[i-2] <= ... <= arr[0]`\n\nThe loop invariant ensures that each element is sorted in the array and correctly positioned for the next iteration.\n\nHere's the thought process:\n\n1. Start with the first element in the array, `arr[i]`.\n2. Compare `arr[i]` with the elements to its left. If `arr[i]` is greater than any of these elements, it needs to be moved to the correct position.\n3. Move `arr[i]` to its correct position by swapping it with the first element that is greater than it.\n4. Continue this process for all elements to the left of `arr[i]`, until there are no more elements to move.\n5. After each iteration, `arr[i]` will be in its correct position, so the invariant holds true for the next iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant ensures that each element in the array is correctly positioned for the next iteration, and therefore proves the partial correctness of the program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = len(arr)\n    while q > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        q -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`q`\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5728Python\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4f5c\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f`arr[z - 1]`\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`arr[i - 1]`\u3002\n\n\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u4f1a\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff08\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a1\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u5176\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5982\u679c\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5927\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5219\u5c06\u5176\u5411\u540e\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6211\u4eec\u5230\u8fbe\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u88ab\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u4e86\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
