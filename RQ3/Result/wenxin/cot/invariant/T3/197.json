However, I cannot write the loop invariant for you as it requires you to consider specifics of your algorithm.\n\nIf you provide some specific information about your code (like the data structure, expected output, or error messages), then I may be able to help you better.\n\nUntil then, I suggest you verify that you correctly initialized 'r' at the beginning of each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nI suggest initializing 'r' to the start of the unsorted part of the array, i.e., 'r = 1'.
