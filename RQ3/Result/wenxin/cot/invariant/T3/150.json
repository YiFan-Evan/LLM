To prove the partial correctness of this function, we need to define a loop invariant for the `i`-th iteration of the loop.\n\nLoop invariant for the `i`-th iteration:\n\n* `arr[i]` is a valid element of the array `arr`\n* `sum_value` is initialized to 0\n* `k` is initialized to 0\n* Before the `k` is incremented in each iteration, `sum_value` is increased by `arr[i]`\n\nNow, let's consider the code for each iteration:\n\n1. Iteration 1:\n\n\n\t* `arr[k]` is a valid element of the array `arr` (assumed to be in the correct range)\n\t* `sum_value += arr[k]` adds the current element to the sum\n\t* `k += 1` moves to the next element\n2. Iteration 2:\n\n\n\t* Similar to above: `arr[k]` is a valid element of the array, and it's added to the sum.\n\t* Then, `k += 1` moves to the next element.\n3. Iteration n:\n\n\n\t* Similar to above: `arr[k]` is a valid element of the array, and it's added to the sum.\n\t* Then, the loop terminates when `k` reaches the length of the array, so `k += 1` does not occur anymore.\n\nTherefore, at the end of each iteration, `sum_value` will contain the sum of all elements in the array.
