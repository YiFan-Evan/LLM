To prove the partial correctness of this function, we need to establish an invariant for each iteration of the loop.\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be written as: `j_value = j + 1`\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. At the start of each iteration, `j` is 0, which means that the target element hasn't been checked yet.\n2. If `arr[j]` is equal to the target (`arr[target]`), then `id_value` is updated to `j`. This means that we have found the target element at index `j`.\n3. After updating `id_value`, `j` is incremented by 1, which means that we are moving to the next element in the array.\n4. Therefore, the invariant ensures that `j` always represents the index of the next element to be checked after the current one.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is `j_value = j + 1`.
