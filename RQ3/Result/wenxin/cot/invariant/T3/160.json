Initially, the array `arr` is unsorted and contains elements in any order.\n2. The outer while loop iterates over each element `arr[i]` in the array.\n3. Inside the inner while loop, we compare `arr[i]` with the elements to its right. If `arr[i]` is greater than any of these elements, it needs to be moved to its correct position in the sorted array.\n4. This is achieved by swapping `arr[i]` with the element in its correct position. This ensures that `arr[i]` becomes smaller than or equal to all elements to its right in the array.\n5. After each iteration of the inner loop, `arr[i]` becomes smaller than or equal to all elements to its right, so the invariant holds true for the next iteration of the outer loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm maintains the invariant that arr[i] is smaller than or equal to all elements to its right in the array. This invariant ensures that the algorithm correctly sorts the array in ascending order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    a = len(arr)\n    while a > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        a -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6700\u540e\u7684`while`\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86`a`\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5224\u65ad\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        a = i\n        while a > 0 and arr[a - 1] > arr[a]:\n            arr[a], arr[a - 1] = arr[a - 1], arr[a]\n            a -= 1\n        arr[a + 1:] = sorted(arr[a + 1:])\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e `i`\uff08\u4ece 1 \u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u67e5\u770b\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5b83\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u5408\u9002\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u90a3\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u6bcf\u6b21\u90fd\u5c06\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u51cf\u5c0f\u4e00\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3a O(n^2)\u3002\n\n\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684 `i` \u548c `z` \u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5e94\u8be5\u5206\u522b\u8868\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u89c9\u5f97\u56f0\u60d1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u79f0`i`\u548c`z`\u6ca1\u6709\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b83\u4eec\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u5230\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff08\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u6536\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u91cf\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684 `i` \u548c `z` \u66f4\u6539\u4e3a\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982 `current_index` \u548c `previous_index`\u3002"}]
