If it is greater than or equal to any of these elements, it moves it to the correct position in the sorted array. This process continues until there are no more elements to its left that are greater than or equal to the current element. Once this happens, the outer while loop increments \"s\" by 1 and continues with the next element.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"s_value = arr[s-1]\". This ensures that \"s_value\" is always referring to an element in the sorted array, ensuring correctness of the algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = len(arr)\n    while s > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        s -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684 `s` \u548c `i` \u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\u5728 Python \u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d `i` \u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u800c `s` \u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u957f\u5ea6\u6216\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u91cf `z` \u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7528\u9014\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u548c\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u6211\u5efa\u8bae\u4ee5\u4e0b\u66f4\u6539\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf `i` \u6765\u8868\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u8981\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684 `s` \u548c `z`\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u5916\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u4ece 1 \u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6211\u8fd8\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u627e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5e94\u8be5\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u66f4\u52a0\u6e05\u6670\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u3002"}]
