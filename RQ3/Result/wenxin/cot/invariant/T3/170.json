Start with the base case `k = 0` and initialize `z = i` for the inner loop.\n2. The outer loop checks if `k` is less than the length of the array. If it is, it proceeds to the next iteration.\n3. Inside the outer loop, the inner loop checks if `arr[z]` is greater than or equal to `arr[z - 1]`. If it is, it moves `arr[z]` to its correct position in the sorted array by swapping it with `arr[z - 1]`. It then moves `z` one position back.\n4. This process continues until `z` reaches 0 or `arr[z - 1]` is greater than or equal to `arr[i]`.\n5. After each iteration of the inner loop, `k` is incremented by 1 to ensure that the next iteration starts from the correct position in the array.\n6. The loop invariant ensures that `arr[i]` is in its correct position in the sorted array at the start of each iteration of the outer loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant proves that the insertion sort algorithm maintains the sorted order within each iteration of the loop, ensuring that `arr[i]` is in its correct position at the start of each iteration. This proves the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = len(arr)\n    while k > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        k -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5c06`i`\u66f4\u6539\u4e3a`arr[i]`\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = len(arr)\n    while k > 0:\n        z = arr[k - 1]\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > z:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        k -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5feb\u901f\u539f\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}]
