If it's not, then it means we need to perform more iterations in the outer while loop, so the invariant holds for the i-th iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Your code has the correct loop invariant to prove the partial correctness of your selection sort algorithm. The invariant ensures that each iteration of the outer while loop moves the minimum element to its correct position in the sorted array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    g = len(arr)\n    while g > 0:\n        g -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[g]:\n                temp = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba9\u6211\u786e\u8ba4\u4e00\u4e0b\u4f60\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u662f\u5426\u6b63\u786e\u3002\n\n\u4ece\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u770b\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6211\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`g`\u88ab\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e3a\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11`g`\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\n\n\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    g = 0\n    while g < n:\n        min_index = g\n        for z in range(g + 1, n):\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = z\n        arr[g], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[g]\n        g += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u627e\u51fa\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u968f\u65f6\u5411\u6211\u63d0\u95ee\u3002"}]
