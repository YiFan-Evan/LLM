The invariant you're looking for should explain the values of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[z]` for each iteration of the loop.\n\nFor the `i`-th iteration of the loop, we want to have an invariant that ensures that `arr[i-1]` is smaller than or equal to `arr[i]` for all `i` from 1 to `o`. This ensures that the algorithm correctly places `arr[i]` in its correct position in the sorted array.\n\nHere's an invariant that fulfills these requirements:\n\n\n```python\narr[i-1]_value = min(arr[i-1], arr[i])\n```\nIn each iteration, `arr[i-1]_value` is set to the minimum of `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`. This ensures that `arr[i-1]` is always smaller than or equal to `arr[i]`, as required by the insertion sort algorithm.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is `arr[i-1]_value = min(arr[i-1], arr[i])`.
