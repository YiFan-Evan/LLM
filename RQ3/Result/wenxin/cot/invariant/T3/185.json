Initially, `f` is set to 0, representing the start of the unsorted part of the array.\n2. Inside the outer while loop, we start a new inner while loop that iterates from `z = f + 1` to the end of the array (`len(arr)`). This loop checks if `arr[z]` is smaller than `arr[f]`, which means it should be moved to the beginning of the sorted subarray.\n3. If `arr[z]` is smaller than `arr[f]`, we swap their values, maintaining the invariant that `arr[i]` is the smallest element in its sorted subarray.\n4. After each iteration of the inner loop, `f` is incremented, moving the current smallest element further into the sorted part of the array.\n5. After finishing the outer while loop, we return the sorted array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the selection sort algorithm is `arr[i] is the smallest element in the current sorted subarray [arr[i], arr[f]].`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    f = len(arr)\n    while f > 0:\n        f -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[f]:\n                temp = arr[f]\n                arr[f] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5728`while`\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b83\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002\n\n\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u4ea4\u6362\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`temp`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5b83\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u5982\u4e0b\u6240\u793a\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        n -= 1\n        f = n\n        while f > 0:\n            g = f\n            while arr[g] < arr[f]:\n                temp = arr[f]\n                arr[f] = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = temp\n            g -= 1\n            f -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u90fd\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u8fd8\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
