It iterates through the array and moves elements in the array in order, maintaining the invariant that for each i, arr[i] <= arr[i+1].\n\nNow, to prove the partial correctness of this function, we need to prove that this invariant holds for each iteration of the loop. Let's assume that we have an array `arr` with elements `[3, 2, 5, 1, 4]` and we are currently at the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\nIn the first iteration, the invariant is:\n\n* `arr[i] <= arr[i+1]`\n\nTo prove this, we need to show that `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[n-1]` for each i from 0 to n-2 (with n being the length of the array).\n\nThe operation performed in the loop is:\n\n* Move `arr[z]` to `arr[z-1]` (the element immediately before it)\n* Then move `arr[z-1]` back to its original position, and swap with `arr[z]`\n\nIn other words, `arr[z-1]` has moved to a new position in front of `arr[z]`.\n\nThe new position of `arr[z-1]` will now be behind `arr[i]` if it was initially at index z and ahead of `arr[i]` if it was at z-1. However, we don't care about that now. The point is that whatever new position it has, it will still be less than or equal to `arr[i+1]`. So the invariant is still valid.\n\nTherefore, for each i from 0 to n-2, the final answer is: The invariant holds for each iteration of the loop.
