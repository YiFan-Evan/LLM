[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

We initialize `count_value` to 0 and `n` to 0. `n` represents the current index in the array `arr`.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through the array `arr` until `n` reaches the length of the array.\n\nStep 3: For each element in the array, compare it to the target `target`.

We are iterating through the array from the last element (`arr[len(arr)-1]`) to the first element (`arr[0]`).\n\nStep 2: Iterate through the array until `n` reaches 0.
