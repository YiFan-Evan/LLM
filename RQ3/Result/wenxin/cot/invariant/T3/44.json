This is because the loop condition is e > 0, so it will only iterate when e is greater than 0.\n* During each iteration, the e variable is decremented by 1, and if the current element in the array is equal to the target, then count_value is incremented by 1. Therefore, the count_value_i value remains the same as the previous iteration.\n* At the end of the loop, we return count_value, which is equal to the number of occurrences of the target in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The number of occurrences of target in the array is count_value. The loop invariant ensures that the value of count_value_i remains unchanged during each iteration of the loop, thereby proving its partial correctness."}]
