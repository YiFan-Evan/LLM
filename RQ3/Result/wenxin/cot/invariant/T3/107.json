[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It also ensures that the value of `member_value` is updated correctly based on the value of `arr[h]` and the index `h` in each iteration.\n\nHere's the thought process and conclusion:\n\n1. Initialize `member_value` to `-1` and `h` to `0` at the start of the loop.\n2. In each iteration, check if `h` is equal to the target `id`. If it is, assign the corresponding value from `arr` to `member_value`.\n3. Increment `h` by 1 to move to the next element in the array.\n4. The loop invariant ensures that `member_value` has the correct value for each iteration based on the current index `h` and the corresponding value from `arr[h]`.\n5.
