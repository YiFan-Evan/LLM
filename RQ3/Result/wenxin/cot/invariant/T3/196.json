The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`arr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i+1])`\n\nThis invariant proves the partial correctness of the program because it shows that at each iteration, the algorithm maintains the invariant that the i-th element is in its correct position in the sorted array.\n\nLet's go through the thought process for each step:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The outer loop starts at index q = 0. The invariant is initialized with `arr[i] = arr[q]` which means that at the start of the first iteration, the first element is in its correct position.\n2. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares elements from index q + 1 to the end of the array. If it finds an element that is smaller than the current 'pivot' (qth element), it swaps them. This ensures that the pivot (qth element) is always in its correct position, which is at the end of the sorted part of the array.\n3. **Increase q**: After each iteration of the inner loop, q is increased by 1, moving to the next element in the array. This ensures that all elements are processed and swapped in their correct positions.\n4. **Return**: After the outer loop finishes, the sorted array is returned.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant proves that the selection sort algorithm maintains the invariant that each element is in its correct position in the sorted array, and thus proves its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    q = len(arr)\n    while q > 0:\n        q -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[q]:\n                temp = arr[q]\n                arr[q] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u4e0e\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u662f\u540c\u4e49\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u903b\u8f91\u4e5f\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`z < arr[q]`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5e94\u8be5\u5728`if`\u8bed\u53e5\u540e\u9762\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9017\u53f7\u5206\u9694\u7b26\uff0c\u4ee5\u5c06`arr[q]`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u6ca1\u6709\u5c06\u7d22\u5f15`z`\u589e\u52a01\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = temp\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5192\u6ce1\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f60\u539f\u672c\u7684`selection sort`\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5192\u6ce1\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u91cd\u590d\u5730\u904d\u5386\u8981\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u5217\uff0c\u4e00\u6b21\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4ed6\u4eec\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u9519\u8bef\u5c31\u628a\u4ed6\u4eec\u4ea4\u6362\u8fc7\u6765\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6ca1\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u9700\u8981\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\u6570\u5217\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u5e8f\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u7531\u6765\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u8d8a\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4f1a\u7ecf\u7531\u4ea4\u6362\u6162\u6162\u201c\u6d6e\u201d\u5230\u6570\u5217\u7684\u9876\u7aef\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u6216\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u7ee7\u7eed\u63d0\u95ee\u3002"}]
