It selects the minimum element from unsorted data at each iteration, and then swaps it with the first element in the unsorted data. The program iterates over the array multiple times until all elements are sorted.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to provide a loop invariant for each iteration. Here's an invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n* `arr[k]` points to the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.\n\nThis invariant is based on the fact that in each iteration, the inner loop checks if `arr[z]` is less than `arr[k]`, and if so, swaps them. Therefore, `arr[k]` should always point to the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.\n\nHere's the thought process:\n\n1. Initialize `k` to the first element in the unsorted part of the array.\n2. In each iteration, move `k` to the next unsorted element.\n3. Inside the inner loop, compare `arr[z]` with `arr[k]`. If `arr[z]` is smaller, swap them and move `z` to the next unsorted element.\n4. Continue this process until all elements are swapped or until `z` reaches the end of the array.\n5. After each iteration, `arr[k]` should point to the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Therefore, the loop invariant holds for each iteration of the selection sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    k = len(arr)\n    while k > 0:\n        k -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[k]:\n                temp = arr[k]\n                arr[k] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5728`while`\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b83\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4f60\u5728`while`\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`z`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5b83\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u4f7f\u7528`k`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ec8\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\n\n\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u6211\u731c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u60f3\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        min_idx = i\n        for j in range(i+1, n):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:\n                min_idx = j\n        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u627e\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u7ee7\u7eed\u5728\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bf7\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff01"}]
