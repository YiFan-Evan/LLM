The invariant should state that for each iteration, the minimum element has been found and moved to its correct position.\n\nHere's an invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n`arr[r_i] = min(arr)`\n\nThis invariant states that at each iteration, `arr[r_i]` is the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array. This is because the outer while loop iterates until `r` reaches the end of the array, and inside the inner while loop, it compares all elements `arr[z]` with `arr[r]` and if `arr[z]` is smaller than `arr[r]`, it swaps them. Therefore, at each iteration, `arr[r]` will contain the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n`Therefore, the final answer is: arr[r_i] = min(arr)` for each i from 0 to len(arr)-2`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    r = 0\n    while r <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = r + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[r]:\n                temp = arr[r]\n                arr[r] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        r += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your code seems to be correct and it is implementing the selection sort algorithm.
