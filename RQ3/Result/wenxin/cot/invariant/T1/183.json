The loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop is:\n\n\n```makefile\narr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[d]\n```\nIn other words, this invariant states that the elements in the current iteration are sorted from left to right, excluding the element itself (since `d` represents the position of the current minimum).\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the code, let's break down the inner while loop. Assume `arr = [4, 3, 2, 1]` is our initial array. In the first iteration of the outer loop, `d` is initially set to `0`.\n\nThe inner while loop is running with `z` set to `1`, checking if `arr[z] < arr[d]`. It does so by checking if `4 < 3`, which is indeed true, so `arr[d]` and `arr[z]` are swapped. Now `arr` becomes `[3, 4, 2, 1]`.\n\nIn the next iteration of the outer loop, `d` is increased to `1`, and we start checking if `arr[z] < arr[d]` again. Since `z` is now at position `2`, we check if `3 < 4`, which is false, so we don't swap anything.\n\nNow we're back to the next iteration of the inner loop, where `z` is increased to `3`, and we check if `arr[z] < arr[d]` again. Since this is still true (`2 < 3`), we swap `arr[d]` and `arr[z]`.\n\nThe last thing to do is check if this loop swapped at least one element, which it did: since after this iteration, `arr[1] = 2`, which was greater than `arr[0] = 3`.\n\nTherefore, for each iteration of the outer loop, the elements in the array are sorted from left to right. The final answer is: Therefore, the function `selection_sort(arr)` is partially correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    d = 0\n    while d <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = d + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[d]:\n                temp = arr[d]\n                arr[d] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        d += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5192\u6ce1\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5192\u6ce1\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u91cd\u590d\u5730\u904d\u5386\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u6bcf\u5bf9\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u9879\u76ee\u5e76\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u4ea4\u6362\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6ca1\u6709\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5c31\u662f\u4f60\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\"selection sort\"\u540d\u79f0\u6240\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bef\u89e3\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684`while d <= len(arr) - 1`\u90e8\u5206\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u904d\u5386\u65f6\u5c06`d`\u589e\u52a01\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u904d\u5386\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u589e\u52a0\u3002\n\n\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5192\u6ce1\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u80fd\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]\n    return arr\n```\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u786e\u5b9e\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8bf7\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u5f88\u4e50\u610f\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f60\u3002"}]
