If the element is greater than its left neighbor, it swaps the elements. This process continues until `z` reaches `0` or an element that is not greater than its left neighbor is encountered.\n\nThe outer loop iterates until `h` reaches `len(arr)` and swaps elements as necessary to maintain the loop invariant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The insertion sort algorithm maintains the invariant that the elements in the `i-h+1` to `i` positions of the array are in ascending order. This invariant ensures that the algorithm performs its operations correctly and sorts the array in ascending order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0a\u6709\u4e9b\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528`i`\u6765\u8868\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u8981\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`z`\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f53\u524d\u8981\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528`j`\u6216`k`\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u6211\u5bf9\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        j = h\n        while j > 0 and arr[j - 1] > arr[j]:\n            arr[j], arr[j - 1] = arr[j - 1], arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\uff1a\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6309\u7167\u987a\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e5f\u9075\u5b88\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u6240\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff1a\u5373\"loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop\"\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b83\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u6709\u6548\u76f4\u5230\u4f60\u5904\u7406\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002"}]
