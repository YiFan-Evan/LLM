The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`arr[i] == target`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the current element in the array is equal to the target element. It is used to prove the partial correctness of the program.\n\nHere's the thought process:\n\n1. Start with the initial conditions: `id_value` is set to -1 and `m` is set to 0.\n2. Iterate through the array `arr` until `m` reaches the length of the array.\n3. Inside the loop, compare the current element in the array `arr[m]` with the target `target`. If they are equal, update `id_value` with the current index `i`.\n4. Continue iterating until all elements in the array have been checked.\n5.
