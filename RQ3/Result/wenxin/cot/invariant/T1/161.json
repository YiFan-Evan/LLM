The outer loop iterates from `b` to the end of the array (`len(arr)`). It will continue until we reach the end of the array.\n2. Inside the outer loop, we have an inner loop that moves elements downwards as needed. It starts at `z = b`.\n3. We move the `arr[z]` element down one position to make space for it, then we update `arr[z - 1]` with `temp`. This ensures that `arr[z - 1]` is now in its correct position.\n4. After each iteration of the inner loop, `z` is decremented by one, so it will eventually reach `0`.\n5. After the inner loop finishes, `arr[i]` will be in its correct position at the start of the array, and all elements to its left will be in ascending order.\n6. The invariant ensures that after each iteration of the outer loop, the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm is `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[b]`.
