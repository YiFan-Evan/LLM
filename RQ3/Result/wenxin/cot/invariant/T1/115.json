The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Initialize the loop invariant: `member_value_value` to `-1` as it represents the value of the member we are looking for. `p` is set to `0` as it represents the current index in the array.\n2. In each iteration, we check if `p` is equal to the `id` we are looking for. If it is, we set `member_value_value` to the value at index `p` in the array, which is the member we are looking for.\n3. Then, we increment `p` by 1 to move to the next element in the array.\n4. The loop continues until `p` reaches the length of the array, indicating that we have checked all elements in the array.\n5. Therefore, the final answer is: `member_value_value = arr[id]` which proves that the function `give_member` correctly returns the value of the member with the given ID.\n\nConclusion: The provided Python program and loop invariant correctly prove the partial correctness of the function `give_member`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    p = 0\n    while p <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if p == id:\n            member_value = arr[p]\n        p += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u975e\u5e38\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u7684\u8865\u5145\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\u60a8\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u5728\u539f\u6765\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a8\u6f0f\u6389\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5faa\u73af\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u8fdb\u5165\u65e0\u9650\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5224\u65ad\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e0e\u60a8\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    p = 0\n    while p < len(arr) and p <= id:\n        if p == id:\n            member_value = arr[p]\n        p += 1\n    return member_value\n```\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u8fd4\u56de\u7ed9\u5b9aID\u7684\u6210\u5458\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u68c0\u67e5\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u5458ID\u7684\u5339\u914d\u9879\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u5339\u914d\u9879\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de`-1`\u3002\u5982\u679c\u9700\u8981\u5176\u4ed6\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8bf7\u968f\u65f6\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff01"}]
