The initial value of `member_value` is -1, so we initialize `member_value_prev` with -1.\n2. Consider the condition of the loop, `k < len(arr)`. This ensures that we will iterate through all elements of the array.\n3. In each iteration, we check if `k` is equal to `id`. If it is, we set `member_value` to the value of `arr[k]`. Therefore, if we compare `arr[id]` with `member_value_prev`, we will have an indication of whether or not `id` was within the range of valid indices of the array.\n4. Finally, if we exit the loop with a value for `member_value` greater than -1, then the loop invariant is true and we can assume that `member_value` holds a valid member value.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the `give_member` function is `member_value_prev = -1`. This invariant ensures that we correctly iterate through all elements of the array and set `member_value` to a valid member value."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    k = 0\n    while k <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if k == id:\n            member_value = arr[k]\n        k += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e86\uff0c\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570 `give_member`\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4 `arr` \u4e2d\u67e5\u627e\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a `id` \u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n\n\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u672b\u5c3e\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd4\u56de\u8bed\u53e5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u8fd4\u56de `member_value` \u7684\u503c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u672b\u5c3e\u6dfb\u52a0 `return member_value`\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    k = 0\n    while k <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if k == id:\n            member_value = arr[k]\n        k += 1\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u6570\u7ec4 `arr` \u4e2d\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a `id` \u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\u3002\u5982\u679c `id` \u4e0d\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de `-1`\u3002"}]
