The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop should state the condition of the loop, and should also show that the invariant is maintained until the end of the loop.\n\nHere's my thought process:\n\n1. At the start of each iteration, we need to ensure that the current index (`f`) is less than the length of the array (`len(arr)`).\n2. If `f` equals the ID (`id`), we update `member_value` with the value at index `f` in the array.\n3. After updating `member_value`, we increment `f` by 1.\n\nBased on these conditions, here's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n`member_value_value = fun(arr[f]->arr[f])`\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n`member_value_value = arr[id]`\n\nIn other words, `member_value` will be set to the value at index `id` in the array after each iteration of the loop.
