Let's explain this in detail:\n\nIn the i-th iteration of the outer while loop, we compare `arr[i]` with `arr[i-1]`. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[i-1]`, we swap them using the inner while loop. This ensures that `arr[i]` becomes the smallest element in its current position.\n\nAfter swapping, we move on to the next element `arr[i+1]` and repeat the process. This continues until we have processed all elements in the array.\n\nThe invariant ensures that at the end of each iteration, `arr[i]` is the smallest element in its current position. Therefore, the array is sorted at the end of the outer while loop, which completes the insertion sort algorithm.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the provided Python program is `arr[i] = arr[i-1]`. This ensures that the array is sorted at the end of each iteration of the outer while loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    t = 0\n    while t <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        t += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528`i`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    t = 0\n    while t < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = t + 1\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            arr[z], arr[z - 1] = arr[z - 1], arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        t += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u5c06`i`\u6539\u4e3a`z`\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u9632\u6b62\u4e0e\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u7136\u540e\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\u8ba1\u6570\uff09\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8d9f\u4e2d\u6211\u4eec\u8981\u79fb\u52a8\u591a\u5c11\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u5b83\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
