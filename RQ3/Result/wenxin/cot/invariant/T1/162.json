The loop invariant you want to prove for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n\n```python\narr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i])\n```\nIn the i-th iteration, the value of `arr[i]` is sorted correctly.\n\nHere's my thought process and conclusion:\n\n* In the inner while loop, `z` is used to traverse the elements before `arr[i]`. If `arr[z - 1]` is greater than `arr[i]`, then `arr[i]` needs to be moved to its correct position.\n* After moving `arr[i]` to its correct position, `z` is decremented, so that the next iteration can continue from the correct position of `arr[i]`.\n* The outer while loop continues until `c` reaches the length of the array, indicating that all elements have been processed and sorted correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm is `arr[i] = arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`. This invariant ensures that `arr[i]` is correctly sorted at each iteration, proving the partial correctness of the program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        c += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06`i`\u66f4\u6539\u4e3a`index`\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5408\u9002\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u3002\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c < len(arr) - 1:\n        index = c\n        while index > 0 and arr[index - 1] > arr[index]:\n            temp = arr[index]\n            arr[index] = arr[index - 1]\n            arr[index - 1] = temp\n            index -= 1\n        c += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f00\u59cb\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
