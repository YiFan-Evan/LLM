[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of this function is to compute the sum of an array `arr`. It starts by initializing `sum_value` to zero, then proceeds through the array's elements one by one, adding each to `sum_value`. The last thing it does is return the final `sum_value`.\n\nHowever, there is no need for a loop invariant here. Loop invariants are typically used to prove that the loop's execution has been done correctly, and they are usually written in the form of an equation that remains true throughout the loop's execution.\n\nIn this case, the loop invariant is simply that `sum_value` is equal to the sum of the array `arr`. Since we are doing exactly what we set out to do, there is no need for a further statement to prove its correctness.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe code for this function fulfills its purpose correctly.
