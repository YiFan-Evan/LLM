The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n```less\nmember_value_at_index_i = arr[i]\n```\n\nThe function is designed to go through the list from the start to the end, and whenever it encounters the index of the member it will store its value. The invariant ensures that we always have the correct value of the member at the current iteration.\n\nThe function can only return the correct value if the invariant holds true throughout the loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```less\nTherefore, the final answer is: member_value_at_index_i = arr[id]\n```\n\nThis invariant ensures that the function always returns the correct value of the member in the list.
