[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This function is called in the loop for each iteration `i` of the outer loop. The invariant ensures that for each iteration, we are finding the minimum value within a smaller subarray.\n\n**Conclusion**:\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n```python\nmin_value = find_min(arr[start:len(arr)])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    g = 0\n    while g <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[g] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[g]\n        g += 1\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u67e5\u627e\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u8865\u5145\u8bf4\u660e\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u8bf7\u968f\u65f6\u5411\u6211\u63d0\u95ee\u3002"}]
