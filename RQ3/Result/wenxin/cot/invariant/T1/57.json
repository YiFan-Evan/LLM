At the start of each iteration, we have `count_value = 0` and `r = 0`.\n2. If the current element `arr[r]` is equal to the target `target`, then we increment `count_value` by 1.\n3. Therefore, at the end of each iteration, `count_value_i` will be equal to `count_value + 1`.\n4. Since the loop iterates until `r` reaches the length of `arr`, the final value of `count_value_i` will be equal to the number of occurrences of the target in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the given program is `count_value_i = count_value + 1`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    r = 0\n    while r <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[r] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        r += 1\n    return count_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5f88\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u58f0\u660e\u540e\u9762\u52a0\u4e0a\u5192\u53f7\uff08:\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7f16\u7a0b\u7684\u60ef\u4f8b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u51fd\u6570\u4f53\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    r = 0\n    while r <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[r] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        r += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6b21\u6570\u3002\u5b83\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u904d\u5386\u5b8c\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7b49\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u5c31\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u6b21\u6570\u3002"}]
