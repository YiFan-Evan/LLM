It iterates through the array and compares each element with the element at the current position. If an element is found to be smaller than the current position, it is swapped with the element at the current position.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[g]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration. The initial condition of g being zero ensures that we start from the first element in the array.\n\nThe proof is simple:\n\n1. The invariant ensures that each iteration compares only elements in the array with smaller indices, ensuring that only the rightmost elements are checked for swapping.\n2. Each time a swap occurs, the next element is checked again to see if it is greater than or equal to its current position, hence ensuring that there are no swaps of adjacent elements in the array.\n3. Therefore, the final array will be sorted in ascending order after completing the loop, which proves the correctness of the program.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided Python program `selection_sort(arr)` correctly sorts an array using selection sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    g = 0\n    while g <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = g + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[g]:\n                temp = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        g += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u4ece\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5b58\u653e\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5168\u90e8\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5143\u7d20\u6392\u5b8c\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cfg\u8868\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0cz\u8868\u793a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5c0f\u4e8eg\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c31\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u4ea4\u6362\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u4ea4\u6362\u540e\uff0cg\u90fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5c31\u662f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u5e8f\u597d\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u6ca1\u6709\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u968f\u65f6\u63d0\u95ee\u3002"}]
