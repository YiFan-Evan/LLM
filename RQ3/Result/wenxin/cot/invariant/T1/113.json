[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`member_value_i = arr[i]`\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Initialization**: At the start of each iteration, we initialize `member_value_i` to `-1` (or any other value) because we haven't found the member yet.\n2. **Invariant maintained**: The loop invariant ensures that `member_value_i` is updated correctly with the value of the i-th element of the array `arr`. If we reach `n == id` and `arr[id]` is a valid member, `member_value_i` is set to `arr[id]`.\n3. **Exit condition**: When `n` reaches the length of the array, it means that we have checked all elements and found the member if it exists.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n`member_value = arr[id]`\n\nThis is because at the end of the loop, `member_value` will hold the value of the i-th element of the array `arr` where `i == id`.
