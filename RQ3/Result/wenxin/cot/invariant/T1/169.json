It works by repeatedly moving elements from the \"j\"th position (where it starts) to their correct positions based on a certain comparison criterion. The criterion used is \"z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]\", which means that if we compare the current element with its neighbors, it should be moved to the correct position if any of its neighbors is greater than it.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this code, we need to establish an invariant for the \"i\" variable in the inner loop. This invariant should be written in the form \"xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])\".\n\nLet's consider the invariant for the \"i\" variable in the inner loop:\n\n\"i_value = arr[i-1] - arr[i]\": This invariant ensures that the current element is always moved to the correct position based on the comparison criterion. It means that if we compare the current element with its neighbors, it should be moved to the correct position if its value is greater than its neighbors.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe invariant \"i_value = arr[i-1] - arr[i]\" proves the partial correctness of the insertion_sort function."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = 0\n    while j <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        j += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7f29\u8fdb\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f29\u8fdb\u662f\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u51b3\u5b9a\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5757\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u548c\u7ed3\u675f\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u50cf\u8fd9\u6837\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:  # \u6ce8\u610f\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u7f29\u8fdb\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:  # \u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u7f29\u8fdb\u4e5f\u5e94\u8be5\u6b63\u786e\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        j += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u6309\u7167\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\"i\"\u548c\"z\"\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\"j\"\u548c\"k\"\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\u4f60\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf\"i\"\u5728Python\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u88ab\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\uff0cPython\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u5b57\u6bcd\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u8868\u793a\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\"i\"\u5e94\u88ab\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\"j\"\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u4ee3\u7801\u624d\u80fd\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u3002"}]
