The invariant should state the condition that should hold for each iteration of the loop.\n\nLet's consider the invariant for the first iteration:\n\n* `arr[l_value] = arr[temp]`: This line means that `arr[l_value]` will have the smallest value after swapping it with `arr[temp]`. The initial `l_value` is set to `l = 0`.\n\nLet's further assume that after the first iteration, `l` is incremented by 1, so it becomes `l + 1`.\n\nNow, let's consider the invariant for the second iteration:\n\n* `arr[z_value] = arr[temp]`: This line means that `arr[z_value]` will have the next smallest value after swapping it with `arr[temp]`. The initial `z_value` is set to `z = l + 1`.\n\nAfter the second iteration, `l` is incremented again, so it becomes `l + 2`.\n\nBased on these assumptions, we can state the loop invariant for each iteration:\n\n* `arr[l_value] = arr[temp]` and `arr[z_value] = arr[temp]`: This means that after each iteration, `arr[l_value]` and `arr[z_value]` will have the smallest and next smallest values in the array respectively.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the `selection_sort` function's loop is `arr[l_value] = arr[temp]` and `arr[z_value] = arr[temp]` for each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = l + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[l]:\n                temp = arr[l]\n                arr[l] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u662f `arr[l]` \u548c `arr[z]`\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f `arr[z]` \u548c `arr[l]`\u3002\u5426\u5219\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u5c06\u4f1a\u59cb\u7ec8\u627e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u628a\u5b83\u653e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6700\u53f3\u4fa7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = l + 1\n        while z < len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[l]:\n                temp = arr[l]\n                arr[l], arr[z] = arr[z], temp\n                l += 1\n            z += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u4e24\u6b21\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u6b21\u4ea4\u6362\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u548c\u539f\u6765\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u867d\u7136\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u6548\u7387\u901a\u5e38\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002"}]
