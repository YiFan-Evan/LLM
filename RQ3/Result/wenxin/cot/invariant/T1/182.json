It is a selection sort algorithm that sorts an array in ascending order. Here's a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n\n```less\narr[i] = arr[i+1]\n```\nThis invariant holds at each iteration of the outer while loop, because the algorithm compares the i+1th element with the first element (i) and swaps them if necessary.
