The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If `m` is equal to `id`, then we know that `arr[m]` is the value of the member with the given ID.\n5. **Conclusion**: Based on the given program and invariant, it can be concluded that at each iteration of the loop, `member_value` holds the value of the member with the given ID, thus proving the partial correctness of the program.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the program because it ensures that `member_value` holds the value of the member with the given ID at each iteration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    m = 0\n    while m <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if m == id:\n            member_value = arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u597d\uff0c\u6211\u660e\u767d\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684Python\u51fd\u6570 `give_member` \u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u3002\u4f60\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u6b63\u5728\u904d\u5386\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4 `arr`\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u7684ID\u3002\u5f53\u627e\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2aID\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u8be5ID\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u503c\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u5217\u8868\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\uff08len(arr)\uff09\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6574\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86 `len(arr) - 1`\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a `m` \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u6570\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5 `m <= len(arr) - 1` \u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53ef\u80fd\u610f\u5473\u7740 `m` \u4f1a\u5c0f\u4e8e0\u3002\n\n\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr):\n        if m == id:\n            member_value = arr[m]\n        else:\n            m += 1\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u7248\u672c\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u4f60\u9884\u671f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5b83\u4f1a\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4 `arr` \u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f00\u59cb\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230ID\u4e3a `id` \u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u904d\u5386\u5b8c\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u8be5\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de `-1`\u3002"}]
