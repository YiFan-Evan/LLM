Now, to prove the partial correctness of the code for each iteration of the loop, we need to define a loop invariant.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n\n> `arr[i] <= arr[(i+1)%len(arr)]`\n\nThis invariant states that the value of `arr[i]` is always less than or equal to the value of `arr[(i+1)%len(arr)]` at any point in the loop. This invariant holds because each iteration of the outer while loop moves the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array to its correct position, so the smallest element `arr[i]` becomes `arr[i+1]`.\n\nSo here's how we prove it:\n\n1. At the start of the i-th iteration:\n\n\n> `arr[i] <= arr[(i+1)%len(arr)]` holds because `arr[i]` is the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array, and `arr[(i+1)%len(arr)]` is the next element in the sorted part of the array.\n2. Inside the inner while loop, if `arr[z] < arr[k]`, then:\n\n\n> `arr[z] <= arr[(k+1)%len(arr)]` holds because `arr[z]` is smaller than `arr[k]`, and `arr[(k+1)%len(arr)]` is also smaller than `arr[(i+1)%len(arr)]`, because we're working on a sorted subarray (that hasn't changed during the inner loop). Therefore,\n> \n> `{[z]} <= {[(k+1)%len(arr)]}` also holds, because the smaller one comes first in the sorted subarray.\n3. At any point in time during the loop, this invariant must hold. Otherwise, there would be a time when this doesn't hold, which would mean that either `arr[i]` or `arr[(i+1)%len(arr)]` is larger than the other, which would mean that they can't both be in their correct positions in the sorted subarray.\n\nTherefore, for each iteration of the loop, the stated invariant proves the partial correctness of your Python program. The final answer is: The provided Python program implementation of selection sort is correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    k = 0\n    while k <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = k + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[k]:\n                temp = arr[k]\n                arr[k] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        k += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n1. \u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\uff0c`k` \u4ece 0 \u5f00\u59cb\u3002\n2. \u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e `k` \uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u540e\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u6bd4\u5b83\u5c0f\u3002\n3. \u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\uff1a\u6211\u4eec\u7528 `z` \u4ece `k+1` \u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u9010\u4e00\u68c0\u67e5\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u540e\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u6bd4 `k` \u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5c0f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c31\u4ea4\u6362\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n4. \u5f53 `k` \u904d\u5386\u5b8c\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u540e\uff0c\u5c31\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662f O(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d n \u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u4e24\u6b21\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5982\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u6267\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u8eab\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u9519\u8bef\u6d88\u606f\u6216\u4f60\u671f\u671b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}]
