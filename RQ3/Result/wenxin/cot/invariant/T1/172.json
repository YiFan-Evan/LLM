[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It is based on the fact that the algorithm's inner while loop is performing an insertion sort, where the new element is always placed in the correct position based on its value.\n\nNow let's analyze each part of the loop to understand why this invariant holds true:\n\n1. \"m < len(arr):\" - This ensures that there are still elements in the array that need to be sorted.\n2. \"z = i\" - z starts as the index of the current element being sorted.\n3. \"while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\" - This loop ensures that the elements are sorted in ascending order. It moves z to the next position if its previous element is greater than itself.\n4. \"temp = arr[z]...\" - This moves the element at position z to the correct position in the sorted part of the array.\n5. \"m += 1\" - This increments m by one after each iteration, indicating that another element has been processed and sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The insertion sort function correctly sorts an array of any size and type as long as it follows the insertion sort algorithm correctly. The loop invariant ensures that each iteration partially sorts the array, resulting in a completely sorted array at the end of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    m = 0\n    while m <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        m += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5728\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53d8\u91cf `i`\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d `i` \u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u793a\u6574\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d22\u5f15\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf `z` \u6765\u4ee3\u66ff `i`\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728 `while` \u5faa\u73af\u7684\u5f00\u5934\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = m\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        m += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662fO(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002"}]
