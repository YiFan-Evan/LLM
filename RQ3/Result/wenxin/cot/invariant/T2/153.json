The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop would be:\n\n`sum_value_i = sum_value_{i-1} + arr[i]`\n\nIn other words, at each iteration, the current sum (`sum_value`) is equal to the sum of the previous iteration's sum (`sum_value_{i-1}`) and the current element in the array (`arr[i]`).\n\nHere's how you would prove this:\n\n1. Initialize `sum_value_i = 0` and `sum_value_0 = 0` (the initial sum and the sum after the first iteration).\n2. Assume `sum_value_i` satisfies the loop invariant, which is `sum_value_i = sum_value_{i-1} + arr[i]`.\n3. Then, at each iteration, we have `sum_value_i += arr[i]`, which proves that `sum_value_i` still satisfies the loop invariant after adding a new element to the sum.\n4.
