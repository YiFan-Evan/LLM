[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If you want to find the minimum value in an array regardless of its order, you should change the function name to something like `find_min_in_order` or `find_smallest_in_order`."}]
