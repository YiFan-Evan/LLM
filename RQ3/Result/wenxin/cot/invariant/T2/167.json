It is designed to sort an array in ascending order. The function operates on an array, which is passed as a parameter.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[h]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop.\n\nHere's the thought process:\n\n1. Start with the first element `arr[i]` in the array.\n2. Move to the right, checking if any element to its right is greater than it. If so, swap them. This ensures that the gap between two elements expands inwards until there is only one element left.\n3. Keep doing this until we reach the end of the array.\n\nAfter each iteration, we check if the array is sorted, by moving to the next element `arr[i+1]` and so on, and verifying if there are any elements that are greater than their neighbours. If not, then the array is not sorted yet, so we need to continue processing more elements.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n`Therefore, the final answer is: arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[h]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`z`\u662f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5b57\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53d8\u91cf`arr[z - 1]`\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528`arr[h]`\u6765\u4ee3\u66ff\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        z = h - 1\n        while z >= 0 and arr[z] > arr[z + 1]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z + 1]\n            arr[z + 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        \n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u903b\u8f91\u3002\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u5e94\u8be5\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4e0e\u540e\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u5b8c\u6210\u4e00\u6b21\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5143\u7d20\u5df2\u7ecf\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4e0d\u4f1a\u518d\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
