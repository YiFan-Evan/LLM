Insertion sort is a type of non-recursive sorting algorithm that maintains the order of the original array and places elements in the sorted part one by one. The goal of each iteration of the outer while loop is to find a gap for placing the current element of the inner loop, i.e., moving from i to z, which represents the index position where the sorted array will be constructed.\n\nIn each iteration of the outer loop, we want to move elements of the array up to ensure that arr[i] will be correctly inserted into the sorted array. We start with z=i, then move the element to its correct position if it is greater than the previous element in the sorted array.\n\nHere's an invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n`insertion_invariant` = `arr[insertion_index] > arr[insertion_index - 1]`\n\nHere's an example thought process:\n\n* The initial assumption is that arr[i] > arr[i - 1].\n* If arr[i] > arr[z], we can safely move it up to the sorted part by swapping them and incrementing z by 1.\n* Otherwise, if arr[z] > arr[i], we continue moving z until it becomes less than or equal to i minus 1 (indicating a gap to insert arr[i]).\n* This loop will keep moving forward until it has properly placed all elements into their sorted positions, i.e., `insertion_index` becomes larger than the start of unsorted array (which we reached in a previous iteration).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm is `arr[insertion_index] > arr[insertion_index - 1]`, where insertion_index is a temporary variable that represents the gap for inserting the current element of the inner loop into the sorted array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = -1\n    while e < len(arr) - 1:\n        e += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u5e94\u8be5\u7528 `i` \u800c\u4e0d\u662f `e`\u3002\u5e76\u4e14\u4f60\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u7684 `z` \u4e5f\u5e94\u8be5\u6539\u4e3a `i`\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        temp = arr[i]\n        j = i + 1\n        while j > 0 and arr[j - 1] > temp:\n            arr[j] = arr[j - 1]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j] = temp\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b50\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u904d\u5386\u7684\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u5219\u8d1f\u8d23\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u6ca1\u6709\u8003\u8651\u5230\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5f53\u6570\u7ec4\u53ea\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u6216\u6ca1\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e9b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}]
