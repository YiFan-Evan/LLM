[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It ensures that at each iteration, the count is updated correctly and that the program does not skip any elements in the array.\n\nHere's the thought process and conclusion:\n\n* Initially, the count_value is set to 0.\n* The c variable is set to 0, indicating the start of the array.\n* The while loop continues as long as c is less than the length of the array.\n* If arr[c] is equal to the target value, then count_value is incremented by 1. This ensures that target values are accounted for in the count.\n* c is incremented by 1, moving to the next element in the array.\n* Once the loop completes, the final count value is returned.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `count_value = give_count(arr[i-1], arr[i])`.
