Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly inserts each element into its correct location based on the sorted order.\n\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the outer loop (`while s < len(arr)`) is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[len(arr)-1]`\n\nThe invariant ensures that each element is correctly inserted into the sorted array. It starts from the current element `arr[i]` and compares it with the elements to its right. If it is greater than any of them, it moves it to the correct position by swapping with the greater element. This process continues until there are no more elements to its right or the current element becomes less than or equal to all elements to its right.\n\nHere's the thought process:\n\n1. The outer loop iterates over each element in the array.\n2. The inner loop iterates over the elements to its right and compares them with `arr[i]`.\n3. If `arr[i]` is greater than any of these elements, it swaps with the greater element and moves `arr[i]` to its correct position.\n4. After each iteration, `arr[i]` becomes less than or equal to all elements to its right, so the invariant holds true for the next iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the outer loop ensures that the insertion sort algorithm correctly inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = -1\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\n        s += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a`insertion_sort`\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u8bd5\u56fe\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u63a5\u6536\u4efb\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4efb\u4f55\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5982`i`\u6216`arr`\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u8ba9\u6211\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f60\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u9053\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f53\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u5f88\u4e50\u610f\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f60\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u3002"}]
