Start with the initial conditions: `id_value` is set to -1 and `c` is set to 0.\n2. Iterate through the array `arr` until `c` reaches the length of the array.\n3. In each iteration, compare the current element `arr[c]` with the target value `target`. If they are equal, update `id_value` with the current index `i`.\n4.
