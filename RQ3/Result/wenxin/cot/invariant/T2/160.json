The outer while loop starts with `a < len(arr)` which means there are still elements in the unsorted subarray.\n2. Inside the inner while loop, `z = i` indicates that we are comparing the current element with its neighbors. Since `z` starts at `i`, we know that `arr[z - 1]` is the element immediately to the left of the current element. Therefore, if `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`, then `arr[i]` must be the smallest element in its subarray.\n3. The inner loop continues while `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]` until it finds an element that is smaller than `arr[i]`. Then it swaps `arr[i]` with this smaller element, maintaining the invariant that `arr[i]` is the smallest element in its subarray.\n4. After each swap, `z` is decreased, so the next comparison will be with the next element in the sorted subarray, maintaining the sorted order.\n5. The outer loop continues as long as there are still elements in the unsorted subarray, so the invariant holds for all iterations of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The insertion sort algorithm maintains the invariant that the smallest element in each unsorted subarray is located at its beginning."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    a = -1\n    while a < len(arr) - 1:\n        a += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u6b63\u5728\u5bf9\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u201ci\u201d\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u201cz\u201d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u5904\u201ca += 1\u201d\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7528\u9014\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u590d\u5236\u4e86while\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u8bf4\u660e\u201ci\u201d\u548c\u201carr\u201d\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u793a\u4f8b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff08\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a1\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5c0f\u4e8e\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5219\u5c06\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5411\u540e\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662fO(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6f84\u6e05\uff0c\u8bf7\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff01"}]
