The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer while loop is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[m-1]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the current iteration are sorted in ascending order.\n\nHere's the thought process:\n\n1. Start with the first element in the array `arr`.\n2. In the inner while loop, compare `arr[z]` with `arr[m]`. If `arr[z]` is smaller than `arr[m]`, swap them. This ensures that the `m`th smallest element is now in its correct position.\n3. Move `m` to the next position in the array after all swaps have been made.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until `m` reaches the end of the array.\n\nThe invariant ensures that after each iteration, the elements in the current iteration are sorted in ascending order.
