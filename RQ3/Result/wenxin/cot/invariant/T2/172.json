For the i-th iteration, the invariant would be \"The i-th element of the array is smaller than the element before it.\"\n\nHere's the thought process:\n\n1. Start with the first element of the array, which is `arr[0]`.\n2. The loop invariant states that `arr[i]` is smaller than the element before it. Therefore, we can compare `arr[i]` with `arr[i-1]` to determine if it should be moved to its correct position in the sorted array.\n3. If `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[i-1]`, then it needs to be moved to its correct position in the sorted array.\n4. To do this, we use a temporary variable `temp` to swap `arr[i]` with `arr[i-1]`.\n5. After swapping, `arr[i-1]` becomes the new `arr[i]`, and we continue to compare it with the previous element.\n6. We repeat this process for each element until we reach the end of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the insertion sort function is \"The i-th element of the array is smaller than the element before it.\" This invariant ensures that each element is moved to its correct position in the sorted array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    m = -1\n    while m < len(arr) - 1:\n        m += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u597d\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u660e\u767d\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u7684Python\u51fd\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u884c\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06 `i` \u66ff\u6362\u4e3a `m`\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u628a\u51fd\u6570\u540d `insertion_sort` \u4e2d\u7684 `i` \u66ff\u6362\u4e3a `m`\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u50cf\u8fd9\u6837\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    m = -1\n    while m < len(arr) - 1:\n        m += 1\n        z = m\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf `m` \u7528\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c `z` \u5219\u7528\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83 `m` \u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u5b83\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u5f53 `m` \u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5927\u4e8e\u5b83\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c31\u4ea4\u6362\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f4\u5230 `m` \u8fbe\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u91cd\u590d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u6392\u5e8f\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
