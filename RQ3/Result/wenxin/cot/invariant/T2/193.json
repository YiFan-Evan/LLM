It also swaps adjacent elements in the unsorted part that are greater than the minimum element.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this function, we need to provide a loop invariant for each iteration of the outer while loop.\n\nThe invariant for the first iteration is: `arr[n] = arr[0]`\n\nThe invariant for each iteration after the first is: `arr[n] <= arr[n+1]`\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. In the first iteration, `n` is 0 and we move the minimum element (the first element) to `arr[n]` by moving `arr[0]` to `arr[n]` and `arr[z]` (which was initially equal to `arr[1]`) to `arr[z]`. Hence, the invariant is established.\n2. In each subsequent iteration, we start with `z = n + 1` and continue moving until we find a larger element. Then, if there are elements larger than `arr[n]`, we swap them with `arr[n]` to keep the invariant true. The reason for this is that if we find a larger element, it means that `arr[n]` is not the smallest element in its current position. Hence, we need to move it to its correct position.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the `selection_sort` function is `arr[n] = arr[i]`\n\nPlease note that this loop invariant does not directly prove the overall correctness of the algorithm. The overall correctness proof involves more considerations like ensuring that swapped elements get swapped back and other properties. However, this loop invariant proves that each iteration of the algorithm is correct with respect to its specific task of finding and swapping the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        z = n + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[n]:\n                temp = arr[n]\n                arr[n] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528`n`\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f53\u524d\u8fd8\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u7528`z`\u6765\u627e\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u66f4\u65b0`n`\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8bbf\u95ee\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = 0\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        min_index = n\n        j = n + 1\n        while j < len(arr):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n            j += 1\n        arr[n], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[n]\n        n += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u521d\u59cb\u5316`min_index`\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e`n`\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u67e5\u627e\u6bd4`min_index`\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u7d22\u5f15\u8d4b\u503c\u7ed9`min_index`\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e`min_index`\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\u589e\u52a0`n`\u7684\u503c\u3002\u6700\u540e\u8fd4\u56de\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
