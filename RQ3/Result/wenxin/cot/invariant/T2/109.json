To prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to establish an invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop would be: `member_value_i = give_member(arr[i], i)`\n\nThis invariant ensures that for each iteration of the loop, we are setting `member_value` to the value of the `arr[i]` element based on the `i` index. It also ensures that the function `give_member` is correctly being called with the correct index, which in turn should return the correct value.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is `member_value_i = give_member(arr[i], i)` which proves the partial correctness of the given Python program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        j += 1\n        if j == id:\n            member_value = arr[j]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u8fd4\u56de\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7d22\u5f15 `id` \u5728\u5217\u8868 `arr` \u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u503c\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`j` \u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e3a `-1`\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u589e\u52a0 `1`\uff0c\u5f53 `j` \u7b49\u4e8e `id` \u65f6\uff0c`member_value` \u88ab\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a `arr[j]` \u7684\u503c\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f `arr` \u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a `id` \u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u5982\u679c `arr` \u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a `id` \u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a `IndexError`\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u968f\u65f6\u5411\u6211\u63d0\u95ee\u3002"}]
