The loop invariant should state the condition of the loop variables at each iteration.\n\nHere's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n\n```less\n`sum_value_i = give_sum(arr[i])`\n```\nThis invariant states that at each iteration, we are adding the sum of the current element in `arr` to `sum_value`.\n\nHere's the thought process:\n\n1. We start with `sum_value = 0` and `l = 0`.\n2. In each iteration, we add `arr[l]` to `sum_value`. This is because we are adding up all the elements in the array.\n3. Then, we increment `l` by 1. This ensures that we are considering the next element in the array for the next iteration.\n4. After finishing the loop, we return `sum_value`, which is the sum of all the elements in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe partial correctness of this function is proven by the loop invariant `sum_value_i = give_sum(arr[i])` for each iteration of the loop.
