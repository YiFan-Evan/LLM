Insertion sort is a type of sorting algorithm that iteratively inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted sequence.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to establish a loop invariant for each iteration of the outer while loop. Let's take a look at the code and see what the invariant should be for each iteration:\n\n1. **Iteration 1**:\n\n\n\t* `arr[q] <= arr[q+1] <= ... <= arr[z]` (At the start of the loop, we know that all elements before `z` are in sorted order)\n2. **Iteration 2 and beyond**:\n\n\n\t* `arr[q] <= arr[q+n-z+1] <= ... <= arr[z]` (Where `n` is the length of the array and `z` is increased each iteration)\n\nThe invariant we want to prove is:\n\n**Invariant**: `arr[q] <= arr[j]` for all `j` from `q` to `z` inclusive.\n\nThis invariant ensures that each element `arr[q]` is inserted into the sorted sequence correctly. Here's why:\n\n* In each iteration, the inner while loop moves the element `arr[z]` to its correct position in the sorted sequence (`arr[z - 1]`). This ensures that `arr[z - 1] <= arr[z] <= arr[q]`.\n* Then, `arr[q]` is moved to its correct position in the sorted sequence by placing it between `arr[z - 1]` and `arr[z]`. It cannot be smaller than `arr[z - 1]` and larger than `arr[z]`, which means it's correct position is in between them.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the provided Python program does indeed perform insertion sort correctly on a given array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided Python program correctly performs insertion sort on a given array using insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = -1\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:\n        q += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49`i`\u548c`arr`\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`i`\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u800c`arr`\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4f60\u8981\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u6211\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u624d\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u7406\u89e3\u4f60\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u5047\u8bbe\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u60f3\u5c06\u4e00\u4e9b\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u5c06`i`\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06`arr`\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u4f60\u8981\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u5047\u8bbe\u6211\u4eec\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a`my_array`\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd9\u6837\u4fee\u6539\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(my_array):\n    q = 0\n    while q < len(my_array) - 1:\n        q += 1\n        z = q - 1\n        while z > 0 and my_array[z - 1] > my_array[z]:\n            temp = my_array[z]\n            my_array[z] = my_array[z - 1]\n            my_array[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return my_array\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0a\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528in-place\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u5373\u53ea\u9700\u7528\u5230O(1)\u7684\u989d\u5916\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u800c\u5728\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u590d\u628a\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5143\u7d20\u9010\u6b65\u5411\u540e\u632a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4e3a\u6700\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u63d0\u4f9b\u63d2\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002"}]
