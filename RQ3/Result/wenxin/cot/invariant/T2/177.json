It is maintained by the while loop, which moves the insertion point `i` forward by swapping elements if necessary.\n\nHere's the thought process and conclusion:\n\n1. The outer while loop (`while r < len(arr)` loop invariant) maintains the invariant `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[r]`. This invariant ensures that we always insert `arr[i]` correctly into its correct position.\n2. The inner while loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`) keeps moving the insertion point `i` forward until we find the correct position for `arr[i]`. If we encounter a position `z` such that `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`, we swap `arr[z]` with `arr[z - 1]` and move `z` one position backward. This ensures that `arr[i]` is always inserted correctly into its correct position.\n3. After each iteration of the inner loop, `i` is incremented by 1, which moves the insertion point one position forward.\n4. After the outer loop finishes, the array is sorted in ascending order, so the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `insertion_sort(arr) returns a sorted array`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u5e2e\u4f60\u4fee\u590d\u5b83\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = 0\n    while r < len(arr):\n        z = r\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            arr[z], arr[z - 1] = arr[z - 1], arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        r += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u9519\u8bef\u662f\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`z`\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u6765\u4ee3\u8868\u6570\u7ec4\u6216\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`z`\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf`r`\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f53\u524d\u8981\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u53d8\u91cf`r`\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf`z`\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u4ea4\u6362\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u6267\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u6309\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
