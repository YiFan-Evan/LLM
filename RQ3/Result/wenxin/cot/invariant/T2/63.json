The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`arr[i] == target`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the current element in the array is equal to the target element.

Iterate through the array `arr` until `d` reaches the length of the array `len(arr)`.\n3. Inside the loop, compare the current element in the array `arr[d]` with the target `target`. If they are equal, update `id_value` with the current index `i`.\n4.
