Initialize the index of the element to be checked (e) to the last element of the array (arr[-1]). This is because the loop condition checks if e is less than len(arr) - 1, which is equivalent to checking if e is less than or equal to len(arr) - 1.\n2. Iterate over the array arr from index e to the end.\n3. For each element in the array, check if it is equal to the target value. If it is, increment the count value by one.\n4.
