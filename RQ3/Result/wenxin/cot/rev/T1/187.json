BFS is a greedy algorithm that explores the graph in a breadth-first manner, starting from the starting node and moving to neighboring nodes before moving to further nodes.\n\nHere's how you can find the shortest path using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty set or list to store the visited nodes. Initially, all nodes are unvisited.\n2. Create a queue to hold the nodes that need to be processed. Initially, node 12 should be added to the queue.\n3. Set a pointer to keep track of the current node in the graph. Initially, set it to node 12.\n4. Iterate through the queue, moving the current node to the next neighbor node until you reach the target node 1.\n5. When you reach the target node, stop the loop and return the path.\n\nHere's the code in pseudocode:\n\n\n```scss\nstartNode = 12\ntargetNode = 1\nvisited = new Set()\nqueue = new Queue()\ncurrentNode = startNode\n\nwhile queue is not empty and currentNode is not targetNode:\n    neighborNode = queue.dequeue()  # Dequeue a node from queue\n    if neighborNode is not in visited:  # If the node is not visited yet:\n        visited.add(neighborNode)  # Mark it as visited\n        if neighborNode is not currentNode:  # If it's not the same node as currentNode:\n            currentNode = neighborNode  # Change currentNode to the next neighbor\n        if neighborNode is not endNode:  # If it's not the target node:\n            queue.enqueue(neighborNode)  # Add it back to queue for further processing\n\nreturn path  # The path will be [startNode, ..., targetNode]\n```\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 12 to node 1 is `[12, 11, 4, 1]`.
