It iteratively selects the node with the shortest distance to the target node and updates the distances of all neighboring nodes.\n\nHere's how we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize a distance array for all nodes with a large number (e.g., 9999). This will be used to mark nodes that have not been visited yet.\n2. Initialize a set of visited nodes with an empty set. This will be used to track nodes that have been processed.\n3. Initialize a priority queue with the starting node (node 6) as the priority. This will be used to select the next node to process.\n4. Iterate over the priority queue until it is empty:\n\t* Extract the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\n\t* If the extracted node is not in the visited set, mark it as visited and update its distance to the target node (node 2).\n\t* Continue this process for all neighboring nodes of the extracted node.\n5. The final shortest path is the sequence of extracted nodes in order of their distance to the target node.\n\nIn this case, node 6 has a distance of 3 to node 2, so we need to follow the path [6, 3]. Node 3 has a distance of 6 to node 2, so we need to follow the path [6, 3, 6]. Therefore, the shortest path is [6, 3, 6].\n\nNote: The above explanation assumes that you are asking for a solution in terms of nodes rather than edges.
