Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Initialize a visited set with all nodes as unvisited (i.e., set all nodes as False).\n3. Initialize a distance array to store the distance from the starting node to each node. Initialize it with a large number (e.g., 9999) for all nodes except the starting node (i.e., 11).\n4. Set the starting node as visited and distance to 0.\n5. Enqueue node 11 into the queue Q.\n6. While the queue Q is not empty:\n\t* Dequeue a node from Q.\n\t* If the dequeued node is 12, then we have found the shortest path from node 11 to node 12. We can stop here.\n\t* Otherwise, go through all adjacent nodes of the dequeued node (as specified in the graph):\n\t\t+ If the adjacent node is not visited, mark it as visited and update its distance to be the distance from the dequeued node to the adjacent node plus the length of the edge from the dequeued node to the adjacent node.\n\t\t+ If there are multiple adjacent nodes that can reach the target node, it doesn't matter which one we pick because they will all lead to the same path, so we can choose any one arbitrarily.\n7. If we have reached node 12 but didn't find a shorter path, it means that there is no path from node 11 to 12 (or there might be multiple paths).\n\nHere's the Python code that implements this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [3],\n    1: [8],\n    2: [6],\n    3: [],\n    4: [8],\n    5: [6],\n    6: [],\n    7: [8],\n    8: [4],\n    9: [13],\n    10: [11],\n    11: [14],\n    12: [],\n    13: [],\n    14: []\n}\nstart_node = 11\ntarget_node = 12\n\nvisited = set()  # A set of visited nodes to avoid duplicates.\nqueue = deque([start_node])  # Initialize queue for BFS.\ndistance = {node: 9999 for node in graph}  # Initialize distance array.\ndistance[start_node] = 0  # Distance from start node to itself is 0.\nvisited.add(start_node)  # Mark start node as visited.\n\nwhile queue:\n    node = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue a node from queue.\n    if node == target_node:  # Found target node?\n        break  # Yes, stop here. We have found the shortest path.\n    for adjacent_node in graph[node]:  # Go through all adjacent nodes of dequeued node.\n        if adjacent_node not in visited:  # If adjacent node is not visited...\n            visited.add(adjacent_node)  # Mark it as visited and update its distance.\n            distance[adjacent_node] = distance[node] + len(graph[node])  # Update distance based on edge length.\n            queue.append(adjacent_node)  # Enqueue adjacent node into queue for next iteration.\n\nshortest_path = []  # Store shortest path in this list.\nfor i in range(start_node, target_node + 1):  # Iterate from start node to target node and store in shortest_path list.\n    shortest_path.append(graph[i][0])  # Add each node in shortest path as its first edge goes to its neighbor (edge array format).\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [9, 5, 4].
