Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Initialize a visited set to keep track of nodes that have already been visited.\n3. Initialize a path variable to store the shortest path.\n4. Add node 8 to the queue Q and set its visited flag to true.\n5. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Dequeue a node v from Q.\n\t2. For each node w that is adjacent to v (and not yet visited):\n\t\t- If w is not yet visited:\n\t\t\t- Add w to the queue Q and set its visited flag to true.\n\t\t\t- Remove w from the visited set of v.\n\t3. If w is equal to the destination node 6, then:\n\t\t- Set path = [v] (path should be an array).\n\t\t- Continue with the next node in the queue Q (i.e., the next adjacent node).\n6.
