Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Start at node 4 and mark it as visited.\n2. Find the neighbors of node 4 that are not yet visited and continue from them.\n3. Repeat this process until you reach node 2 or have visited all nodes.\n\nIn the given graph, node 4 has edges to nodes 5, 0, and 7, but we're only interested in going down from node 4 to reach node 2, so we need to skip the nodes along the way that have an edge leading away from them. Since there's an edge from node 0 to node 2, we start at node 4 and go to node 0.\n\nAfter reaching node 0, there's no direct path to node 2, so we continue along the path from node 0 to reach node 6, and then to node 2.
