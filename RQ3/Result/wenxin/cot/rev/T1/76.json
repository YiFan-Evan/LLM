Initialize a priority queue with the starting node (node 2).\n2. Mark all the nodes as not visited.\n3. Initialize a distance array to hold the distance from the starting node to each node. Initially, all distances are set to infinity (except for the starting node, which is set to 0).\n4. Start a loop until all nodes have been visited:\n\t* Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n\t* If the extracted node is the destination node (node 3), then we have found our shortest path.\n\t* Otherwise, mark all its neighbors as visited and update their distances if necessary.\n\t* Reinsert the updated nodes into the priority queue in a new order.\n5.
