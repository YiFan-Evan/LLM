Initialize an empty queue for BFS and add node 2 to it.\n2. Create a dictionary or list to keep track of the shortest path found so far. Initialize it with a set of all possible initial paths, e.g., `{0}: [0]`.\n3. Keep calling the BFS algorithm for as long as there are still nodes in the queue:\n\n\n\t* At each iteration, take the node from the queue that is closest to the target node. If multiple nodes are at the same distance from the target, choose one arbitrarily.\n\t* Remove this node from the queue and add it to the dictionary/list with the shortest path found so far. For example, if we just got node 2, we might add `{2}: [2]` to the dictionary/list.\n\t* Then, go through all its neighbors and recursively call BFS on each of them, keeping track of the shortest path found so far.\n4. When there are no more nodes in the queue, return the dictionary/list with the shortest path found so far.\n\nHere's how you can implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    queue = deque([start_node])\n    shortest_path = {start_node: [start_node]}  # Initialize shortest path with start node\n    visited = set()  # Keep track of visited nodes\n    visited.add(start_node)\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        if node == target_node:\n            return shortest_path\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                new_path = shortest_path[node] + [neighbor]  # Add new node to path\n                shortest_path[neighbor] = new_path  # Update shortest path with new node\n    return None  # If no path found, return None\n```\nHere's how you can use this function:\n\n\n```python\ngraph = {0: [9], 1: [11], 2: [12], 3: [4], 4: [10], 5: [12], 6: [8], 7: [12]}  # Add your nodes as per your question (re-use provided array)\nstart_node = 2  # Change as per your question\ntarget_node = 9  # Change as per your question\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node))  # Outputs shortest path from start node to target node in format \"1->2->3->4\" etc., if any exists.
