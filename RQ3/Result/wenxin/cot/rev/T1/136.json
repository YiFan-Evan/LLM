Create an empty queue to store the nodes to be visited.\n2. Start with node 6 as the source node.\n3. Iterate through the edges of the graph starting from node 6, adding each adjacent node to the queue if it is not already there.\n4. Keep track of the distance from node 6 to each node in the queue. Initially, all distances are set to infinity except for the distance from node 6 to itself, which is 0.\n5. Continue to process nodes in the queue until it becomes empty.\n6. At each step, you will have a node that has been visited and has a distance of 1 from node 6. Keep track of all nodes with a distance of 1 from node 6.\n7. When you have reached all nodes that are directly reachable from node 6, continue processing their children and their grandchildren in the graph. You will need to adjust the distances as needed so that they represent the actual path lengths.\n8. Repeat steps 3 through 7 until you have visited all nodes in the graph and found the shortest path from node 6 to node 12.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform this task:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [12],\n    1: [8],\n    2: [13],\n    3: [10],\n    4: [9],\n    5: [12, 6],\n    6: [7, 14],\n    7: [],\n    8: [],\n    9: [],\n    10: [],\n    11: [],\n    12: [],\n}\n\nstart_node = 6\ntarget_node = 12\n\nvisited = set()  # To store visited nodes to avoid duplicates\nqueue = deque([start_node])  # Initialize queue with start node\ndistance = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}  # Initialize distance dictionary with infinity for all nodes except start node itself which is 0\ndistance[start_node] = 0  # Distance from start node to itself is 0\n\nwhile queue:\n    node = queue.popleft()  # Pop the first node from the queue\n    visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited\n    for neighbor in graph[node]:  # Iterate through adjacent nodes of current node in graph\n        if neighbor not in visited:  # If the neighbor is not yet visited, add it to queue and update distance for it\n            queue.append(neighbor)\n            if distance[neighbor] == float('inf'):  # If distance for neighbor is infinity, update it with current distance from start node (node value) + 1\n                distance[neighbor] = distance[start_node] + 1\n            else:  # Otherwise, find the minimum distance value of the existing neighbors of the target node from start node (or distance infinity) + 1\n                current_dist = min(min(neighbors_dist + 1 for neighbors_dist in distances[target_node]) for neighbors_dist in distances if neighbors_dist != float('inf')) + 1\n                distance[neighbor] = current_dist if current_dist < distance[neighbor] else distance[neighbor]  # Update distance if current_dist is less than existing distance or infinity for target node's neighbors from start node (or infinity) + 1 else keep existing distance value or infinity (or float('inf')) unchanged. Remember, distance should always be strictly positive here and in subsequent operations in case it was already an infinity earlier or has been zero at some point for other reasons) so set it here before traversing its neighboring nodes so that these calculations won't fail for it because we might find some edges for nodes in neighboring nodes that are already covered by our current source node here)\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 6 to node 12 is: `6 -> 5 -> 12`.
