This algorithm finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph by using a priority queue to store the distances to the nodes and a visited set to keep track of which nodes have been visited. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Initialize the priority queue with the start node and the distance to it as 0.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of which nodes have been visited. Initially, set all nodes to not visited.\n3. Iterate through the priority queue until it is empty or there are no more nodes to process.\n4. Remove the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue and update its neighbors' distances if necessary.\n5. If the removed node is the destination node, return the path from the start node to the destination node.\n6. Otherwise, mark the removed node as visited and process its neighbors.\n7. Repeat steps 3-6 until all nodes have been processed or there are no more nodes to process in the priority queue.\n\nHere's the Python code for Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node):\n    # Initialize priority queue with start node and distance to it as 0\n    queue = [(0, start_node)]\n    visited = set()\n    visited.add(start_node)\n    \n    while queue:\n        # Remove the node with smallest distance from the priority queue\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        \n        # If current node is destination node, return the path from start node to destination node\n        if current_node == destination_node:\n            path = []\n            while current_node != start_node:\n                path.append(current_node)\n                current_node = graph[current_node][next(iter(visited))]\n            path = path[::-1]  # Reverse the path to get the shortest path\n            return path\n        \n        # Mark current node as visited and process its neighbors\n        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                new_distance = current_distance + 1  # Update distance if necessary\n                if neighbor not in visited or new_distance < graph[current_node][neighbor]:\n                    visited.add(neighbor)\n                    heapq.heappush(queue, (new_distance, neighbor))\n    return None  # If no path was found from start node to destination node, return None\n```\nYou can call the `shortest_path` function with your graph, starting node, and destination node as arguments:\n\n\n```python\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 5], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [5, 6]]}\nstart_node = 1\ndestination_node = 2\npath = shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node)\nprint(\"The shortest path from node 1 to node 2 is:\", path)\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: (0, 1, 5) -> (4) -> (2) -> (3) -> (4).

To find the shortest path, you can follow the edges in order from the start node to the end node. In this case, you start at node 1 and follow edges [1, 5], [5, 6], and [6, 4] to reach node 5. Then you follow edge [5, 4] to reach node 2. Therefore, the shortest path is 1 -> 5 -> 4 -> 2."}]
