Look at the list of edges to see if there is an edge that connects node 5 to node 6. There is, so you know that there is a path from node 5 to node 6.\n3. Look at the destination node again, and this time check if there are any nodes in between the start node and the destination node that can be included in the path. In this case, there is a node 7 that is connected to both nodes 6 and 7, so you can include it in the path.\n4.
