Create an empty queue to store the nodes to be visited.\n2. Set the starting node (node 1) as the first node in the queue.\n3. Set the destination node (node 22) as the target node.\n4. Iterate through the queue until it is empty.\n5. During each iteration, remove the first node from the queue and add its adjacent nodes to the queue if they are not already visited.\n6.
