BFS is a greedy algorithm that explores the graph in a breadth-first manner, always considering the next closest node first.\n\nHere's how you can implement BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty set or list to store the path.\n2. Create an empty queue to perform BFS.\n3. Add the starting node (node 16) to the queue.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t* Remove the first node from the queue.\n\t* If the removed node is the destination node (node 2), then we have found the shortest path.\n\t* Otherwise, add all adjacent nodes to the queue that have not yet been visited.\n5.
