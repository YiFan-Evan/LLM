Create an empty queue to store the nodes.\n2. Initially, put node 1 into the queue.\n3. Iterate through the edges of the graph starting from node 1 until we reach node 2 or we have visited all the nodes in the graph.\n4. At each iteration, remove the node from the queue and add its neighbors to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\n5.
