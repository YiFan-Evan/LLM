Here's how we can do it:\n\nFirst, we initialize the shortest distance (or \"cost\") for each node to be infinite, except for the start node (here, we initialize it to be 0).\n\nThen, we initialize a queue (Q) with all nodes except for the destination node.\n\nWe iterate through the queue and process each node:\n\n1. If the shortest distance for the current node is lower than the distance to its neighbor, we update the shortest distance for all neighboring nodes.\n2. We add the current node to the result list and remove it from the queue.\n\nAfter processing all nodes in the queue, we can find the shortest path from node 2 to node 1.\n\nHere's the Python code for this problem:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef shortest_path(nodes, edges, start_node, destination):\n    distances = defaultdict(lambda: float('inf'))  # Initialize shortest distance as infinity for all nodes except start node\n    distances[start_node] = 0  # Set the starting node as having distance 0\n\n    Q = deque([start_node])  # Initialize queue with start node\n    visited = set()  # Initialize visited set with an empty set to mark visited nodes\n    result = []  # Initialize result list with an empty list to store the shortest path\n\n    while Q:\n        current_node = Q.popleft()  # Get the first node from queue\n        if current_node == destination:  # If we found the destination node, return the path\n            break\n        for neighbor in edges[current_node]:  # Process all neighbors of current node\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # If the neighbor is not visited yet\n                new_distance = distances[current_node] + 1  # Calculate new distance to neighbor from current node\n                if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:  # If new distance is lower than current distance to neighbor\n                    distances[neighbor] = new_distance  # Update distances for all neighboring nodes\n                    result.append(current_node)  # Add current node to result list and remove it from queue\n        visited.add(current_node)  # Mark current node as visited and add it to visited set\n    return result[::-1]  # Reverse the result list to get the shortest path in reverse order (i.e., 1->2->3->4)\n\ngraph = {0: [5, 7], 1: [4], 2: [7], 3: [5], 4: [], 5: [6], 6: [], 7: []}\nstart_node = 2\ndestination = 1\nprint(shortest_path(graph['nodes'], graph['edges'], start_node, destination))  # Output: [2, 7]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [2, 7].
