This means that it's already in the shortestDistances set.\n* Find all the neighbors of node 4 that are not yet processed and update their distance values based on the shortest distance so far.\n* Repeat step 3 until all nodes have been processed or until there are no more nodes to process.\n* Find the shortest path from node 4 to node 5 by following the shortest distances in shortestDistances set.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [4, 5]\n\nThis is the shortest path from node 4 to node 5 in the given graph."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 5], [1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]} The end node: 5 The start node: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 4 to node 5 in the given graph is: [4, 5]\n\nHere's the thought process:\n\n1.
