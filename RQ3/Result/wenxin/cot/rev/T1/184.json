Starting from node 0, we can see that there are multiple possible paths to reach node 1.\n\nFirst, we follow edge [0, 9] to reach node 9. Then, we follow edge [9, 16] to reach node 16, and then edge [16, 24] to reach node 24. Since node 24 is our destination node, we need to follow edge [24, 1] to reach node 1.\n\nHowever, if we start from node 0 and follow the path directly to node 1 (by following edge [0, 1]), we can avoid the intermediate nodes 9, 16, and 24.
