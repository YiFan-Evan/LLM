Initialize the distance array with all nodes having a distance of infinity except for the starting node (2) which has a distance of 0.\n2. Find the node with the smallest distance and update its neighbors' distances if it is a shorter path to the target node.\n3. Repeat step 2 until all nodes have been visited.\n\nHere's the code in pseudocode:\n\n\n```python\ninitialize distance array with all nodes having a distance of infinity except for node 2 which has a distance of 0\nwhile there are still nodes with an infinite distance:\n    node with smallest distance = find_node_with_smallest_distance()\n    for each neighbor of node with smallest distance:\n        if shortest_path_to(neighbor) + distance_to(node with smallest distance) < shortest_path_to(neighbor):\n            update_distance_array(neighbor, shortest_path_to(node with smallest distance) + distance_to(node with smallest distance))\n    remove node with smallest distance from the list of nodes to be visited\n```\nNow, let's apply this to our specific graph:\n\n\n```python\ndistance_array = [float('inf') for _ in range(8)]  # Initialize with all nodes having infinity distances\ndistance_array[2] = 0  # Distance from node 2 to itself is 0\n\nwhile there are still nodes with an infinite distance:\n    node_with_smallest_distance = find_node_with_smallest_distance(distance_array)\n    if node_with_smallest_distance != -1:  # Node with smallest distance not at the start or end point (they would have an infinite distance)\n        node = find(graph, key=lambda node: (node not in [distance_array[start], distance_array[end]] and graph[node] == target))  # Find the next node in the shortest path\n        if node != -1:  # If there is a next node, update the distances and remove the current node from the list of nodes to be visited\n            update_distance_array(node, shortest_path(graph, start, node) + distance(node_with_smallest_distance))\n            remove(distance_array, node)  # Remove node from array as it has been processed\n```\nThe shortest path is then found by taking the final entry in the `distance_array`: `[4, 5]` (4 is from node 2 to node 3, then from node 3 to node 5).
