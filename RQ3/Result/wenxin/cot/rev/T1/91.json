Create an empty queue Q to store the nodes that we will visit in the BFS.\n2. Initialize a visited list to keep track of nodes that have already been visited.\n3. Initialize a distance list to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting node to each node.\n4. Add node 8 to Q and set its distance to 0.\n5. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Remove the first node from Q (let's call it node X).\n\t2. If node X is not in the visited list, mark it as visited and add its neighbors to Q with their distances updated accordingly.\n\t3. If node X is equal to node 4, we have found the shortest path! Let's say the path is: 8->9->4 with a distance of 2.\n\t4.
