Initialize a distance array for the nodes, where the distance from the start node to each node is set to infinity except for the start node itself, which is set to 0. Also initialize an array for the shortest path from the start node to each node.\n2. For each node in the graph, find the minimum distance from the start node to that node.\n3.
