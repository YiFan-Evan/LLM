Create an empty queue to store the nodes to be visited.\n2. Set the starting node (node 19) as the first node in the queue.\n3. Set a variable to keep track of the shortest path length. Initially, it will be set to infinity.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t1. Remove the first node from the queue.\n\t2. Check if this node is the destination node (node 22). If it is, return the path (node 19->22).\n\t3. If not, add all adjacent nodes to the queue that have not been visited yet.\n\t4. Update the shortest path length by adding 1 to it for each adjacent node added to the queue.\n5. If no path was found from node 19 to node 22, return an error message or an appropriate result based on the context of the question.\n\nHere's the Python code for this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    \"nodes\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    \"edges\": [\n        [0, 14], [0, 3], [1, 22], [2, 19], [2, 8], [3, 17], [3, 16], [4, 11], [4, 6], [4, 20], [5, 19],\n        [6, 16], [7, 8], [8, 9], [8, 20], [9, 13], [10, 12], [10, 22], [10, 17], [13, 21], [15, 20],\n        [17, 23], [18, 22]\n    ]\n}\nstart_node = 19\ntarget_node = 22\n\nshortest_path = \"\"\nqueue = deque([start_node])\nvisited = set()\nvisited.add(start_node)\nwhile queue:\n    current_node = queue.popleft()\n    if current_node == target_node:\n        shortest_path = current_node + \"->\" + str(target_node) + \"->...\"  # replace \"...\" with the actual path as needed\n        break\n    neighbors = [edge[0] for edge in graph[\"edges\"] if current_node in edge[0]] - visited\n    for neighbor in neighbors:\n        if neighbor not in visited:\n            queue.append(neighbor)\n            visited.add(neighbor)\nshortest_path = \"There is no path from node \" + str(start_node) + \" to node \" + str(target_node) + \".\"  # replace with actual message if needed\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: shortest path from node 19 to node 22 is \"shortest_path\".
