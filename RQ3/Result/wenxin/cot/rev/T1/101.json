BFS explores the graph by moving through its nodes in a pre-determined order (known as a queue) until it reaches the destination node.\n\nHere's how we can do it:\n\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node 7.\n2. Set a visited set to keep track of nodes that have already been visited. Initialize it with a set of all nodes.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n\t1. Extract the next node from the queue (keep track of the extracted node for later use).\n\t2. Check if the extracted node is the destination node (node 1). If so, we've found our path, and we're done.\n\t3. If the extracted node is not the destination node, add its adjacent nodes to the queue in order of their distance from the starting node. This ensures that we explore all possible paths before exploring a node's adjacent nodes that are closer to the destination node.\n\t4. Mark the extracted node as visited and add it to the visited set.\n4. If we reach this point without finding the destination node, there is no path from node 7 to node 1.\n\nHere's the Python code for this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\n# Initialize the graph and the starting and destination nodes\ngraph = {i: [j for j in range(len(graph))] for i in range(len(graph))}  #
