Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Set a flag for each node visited in the BFS. Initially, all flags are false.\n3. Initialize a counter of visited nodes as zero.\n4. Mark node 10 as visited.\n5. Iterate over each node in the queue:\n\t* In each iteration, start by taking a node from the queue, let's call it current node.\n\t* Add its neighboring nodes (only those neighboring nodes that haven't been visited before) to the queue and update their visited flag to true.\n\t* Move the current node to the queue again after checking if it is not already in the queue.\n\t* If the current node is equal to the destination node 1, then we have found the shortest path from node 10 to node 1.\n\t\t+ The shortest path is represented by the sequence of visited nodes.\n\t\t+ The sequence of visited nodes is stored in a list and returned as the answer.\n\nHere's the Python code for the above steps:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [9, 11],\n    1: [8],\n    2: [7],\n    3: [4],\n    4: [5],\n    5: [7],\n    6: [11, 8],\n    7: [11, 10],\n    8: [10],\n    9: [],\n    10: [],\n    11: [],\n    12: []\n}\n\nstart_node = 10\ntarget_node = 1\n\nvisited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\nqueue = deque([start_node])  # Queue for BFS\nvisited.add(start_node)  # Mark start node as visited\n\ndef bfs(visited, queue):\n    while queue:\n        current_node = queue.popleft()  # Take a node from queue and remove it from queue at the same time\n        print(current_node, end=\"->\")  # Print node currently processed (just for debugging)\n        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:  # For each neighbor of current node in graph that has not been visited before\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # If it is a new neighbor and hasn't been visited before...\n                visited.add(neighbor)  # ...mark it as visited and add it to queue (and print it) for next iteration\n                queue.append(neighbor)  # Also add it to queue again to keep track of visited nodes during BFS.
