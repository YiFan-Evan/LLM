Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Initially, put node 4 into Q.\n3. Iterate over Q and keep removing nodes until reaching node 2 or the queue is empty.\n4. At each iteration, take the node from Q, and then find its adjacent nodes (which are nodes 5, 6, and 7). Add these adjacent nodes to Q in order of their distances from node 4 (or shortest first).\n\nThis process will result in a path from node 4 to node 2 in the shortest possible number of steps.
