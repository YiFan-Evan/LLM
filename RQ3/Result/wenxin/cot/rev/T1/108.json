Create an empty queue Q to store the nodes that we will visit in the BFS.\n2. Initialize a visited list to keep track of nodes that have already been visited.\n3. Initialize a distance list to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting node to each node.\n4. Add node 9 to the queue Q.\n5. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Extract the current node u from Q.\n\t2. Update the distance list with the current distance to the extracted node u from the start node.\n\t3. If the extracted node u is not in the visited list, add it to the visited list and remove it from Q (as we've reached the target node).\n6. At this point, if you can see node 3 in the visited list, then you have found the shortest path from node 9 to node 3.\n\nHere's the Python code for this problem:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# The graph represented as an adjacency list\ngraph = {\n    0: [9],\n    1: [12],\n    2: [5, 10],\n    3: [],\n    4: [],\n    5: [2],\n    6: [0],\n    7: [11],\n    8: [],\n    9: [],\n    10: [2],\n    11: [7],\n    12: [2, 3, 4]\n}\n\nstart_node = 9\ntarget_node = 3\n\n# Create an empty queue and initialize visited and distance lists\nQ = deque()\nvisited = []\ndistance = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}  # Initially all distances are infinity\ndistance[start_node] = 0  # Distance from start node to itself is 0\nvisited.append(start_node)  # Start node is visited initially\n\n# Perform BFS to find shortest path from start node to target node\nwhile Q:\n    u = Q.popleft()  # Extract a node from queue and pop it to a variable u\n    for v in graph[u]:  # For each neighbor of u, update the distance list if not yet visited\n        if v not in visited and distance[v] > distance[u] + 1:  # If v is not yet visited and has a shorter path than current shortest path, update it\n            distance[v] = distance[u] + 1  # Update shortest path to v with current distance from u + 1 (u->v)\n            visited.append(v)  # Add v to visited list (as we've reached target node)\n    if v == target_node:  # If v is target node, then stop the loop and return shortest path found so far (if any)\n        break\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 9 to node 3 is 9->6->5->3 (length = 3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 6], [1, 12], [2, 5], [2, 10], [2, 3], [3, 4], [3, 12], [4, 8], [5, 6], [7, 11], [7, 12]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u5b83\u670913\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u548c13\u6761\u8fb9\u3002\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u4f60\u60f3\u627e\u5230\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b99\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b93\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002\n\n\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\uff08DFS\uff09\u6216\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\uff08BFS\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u79cd\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u56fe\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528BFS\u901a\u5e38\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528Python\u548cBFS\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs(graph, start, end):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([start])\n    distance = {node: float('inf') for node in graph}\n    distance[start] = 0\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        if node == end:\n            return distance[node]\n        for neighbour in graph[node]:\n            if neighbour not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbour)\n                queue.append(neighbour)\n                distance[neighbour] = distance[node] + 1\n    return None  # \u5982\u679c\u627e\u4e0d\u5230\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8fd4\u56deNone\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [9],\n    1: [12],\n    2: [5, 10],\n    3: [],\n    4: [],\n    5: [2],\n    6: [0],\n    7: [11],\n    8: [],\n    9: [],\n    10: [2],\n    11: [7],\n    12: [2, 3, 4]\n}\nstart_node = 9\nend_node = 3\nprint(bfs(graph, start_node, end_node))  # \u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u8bdd\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u9996\u5148\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u961f\u5217\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u8bbf\u95ee\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u5f00\u59cb\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b9\u5f00\u59cb\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u4ece\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u53d6\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u5b83\u7684\u6240\u6709\u672a\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u3002\u5982\u679c\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\u5728\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u5e76\u4e14\u6ca1\u6709\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5c31\u5c06\u5b83\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u961f\u5217\u548c\u5df2\u8bbf\u95ee\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u5230\u8fbe\u8be5\u90bb\u5c45\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5c31\u8fd4\u56de\u5176\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c31\u8fd4\u56deNone\u3002"}]
