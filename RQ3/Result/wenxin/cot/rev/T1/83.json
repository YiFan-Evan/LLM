Initialize an empty queue to hold nodes to start the BFS.\n2. Start from node 1 (node 1 in the starting point array).\n3. Push the start node into the queue.\n4. While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:\na. Remove the front node from the queue and add it to the result list.\nb. For each adjacent node of the removed node, check if it is in the result list or not. If it is not, add it to the result list.\n5.
