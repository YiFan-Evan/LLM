It is a graph search algorithm that explores the graph by starting from a given node and then moving to adjacent nodes in a pre-determined order. It finds the shortest path by keeping track of the distance from the starting node to each visited node.\n\nIf you have any other questions or need help with other problems, please let me know!"}]
