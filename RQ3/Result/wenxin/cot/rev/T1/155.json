Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Initialize a visited set to track nodes that have already been visited.\n3. Initialize a path set to track the shortest path from node 0 to node 4.\n4. Add node 0 to the queue Q and to the visited set.\n5. Iterate through the queue Q until it is empty:\n\t* Extract the node n from the queue Q.\n\t* For each neighbor m of node n that is not yet visited, do the following:\n\t\t+ Add m to the visited set.\n\t\t+ If m is equal to node 4, then mark the path as complete and stop the loop.\n\t\t+ Otherwise, add n->m to the path set.\n6.
