Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Start from node 10 and add it to Q.\n3. Initialize a visited set to keep track of nodes that have been visited during the search. Initialize it with an empty set.\n4. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Extract the node with the smallest index from Q (the \"front\" of Q).\n\t2. Add all adjacent nodes of the extracted node to Q (if they are not already in Q and are not in the visited set).\n\t3. Add the extracted node to the visited set.\n5. If you reach node 1 in the end of the search, then you have found the shortest path from node 10 to node 1.\n\nHere's the code in pseudocode:\n\n\n```pseudo\nprocedure shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    Q = empty queue\n    visited = empty set\n    Q.enqueue(start_node)\n    visited.add(start_node)\n\n    while Q is not empty:\n        node = Q.dequeue()\n        for each neighbor of node in graph:\n            if neighbor is not in Q and neighbor is not in visited:\n                Q.enqueue(neighbor)\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n\n    if node == target_node:\n        return \"The shortest path from node 10 to node 1 is: \" + print_path(graph, start_node, target_node)\n    else:\n        return \"The shortest path from node 10 to node 1 does not exist.\"\n```\nNote that you need a procedure `print_path` that prints the shortest path in the given format (e.g., \"1->2->3->4\"). If you don't have such a procedure, you can implement it as follows: You can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 10 to any node along the way, and then concatenate the nodes in order to get the shortest path from node 10 to node 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 11], [1, 8], [1, 12], [2, 7], [3, 4], [4, 5], [4, 7], [6, 11], [6, 8], [7, 11], [8, 10]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\u4e3a10\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\uff08BFS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aPython\u4ee3\u7801\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([start_node])\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_node = queue.popleft()\n        if current_node == target_node:\n            return get_path(graph, start_node, target_node)\n        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    \n    return \"The shortest path from node 1 to node 10 does not exist.\"\n\ndef get_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    path = []\n    while start_node != target_node:\n        start_node = graph[start_node][0]\n        path.append(start_node)\n    path.reverse()\n    return path\n\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12],\n    'edges': [\n        [0, 9], [0, 11], [1, 8], [1, 12], [2, 7], [3, 4], [4, 5], [4, 7], [6, 11], [6, 8], [7, 11], [8, 10]\n    ]\n}\nstart_node = 1\ntarget_node = 10\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node))\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u961f\u5217\u6765\u8ffd\u8e2a\u8981\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u904d\u5386\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u672a\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u627e\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5c31\u4f1a\u8c03\u7528`get_path`\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b9\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u56fe\u662f\u65e0\u5411\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fb9\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6ca1\u6709\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5982\u679c\u56fe\u662f\u6709\u5411\u7684\u6216\u6709\u6743\u91cd\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}]
