If no path is found, return \"No path found\".\n\nNow, because you mentioned a specific starting node (1) and a specific destination node (7), there should be only one shortest path in this graph from node 1 to node 7, and that path should be [1->2->7]. Therefore, the shortest distance between these two nodes is 2. You can verify this by using Python's networkx library to create a graph object from the provided adjacency list and then using BFS to find the shortest path between nodes 1 and 7. Here's an example code snippet:\n\n\n```python\nimport networkx as nx\n\ngraph = nx.Graph()\ngraph.add_nodes_from(range(1, 13))  # Add nodes to the graph\ngraph.add_weighted_edges_from([(i, j, 0) for i, j in edges])  # Add edges with weight 0 (undirected)\n\npath = nx.shortest_path(graph, source=1, target=7)  # Find shortest path from node 1 to node 7\nprint(\"Shortest path:\", path)  # Output: Shortest path: [1, 2, 7]\n```\nIn this code, we first create a NetworkX graph object from the provided adjacency list using `nx.Graph()` and then add nodes and edges using `add_nodes_from()` and `add_weighted_edges_from()`. Next, we use `nx.shortest_path()` function to find the shortest path between nodes 1 and 7 and print the result."}]
