Initialize a queue for BFS and set the start node as the first item in the queue.\n2. Iterate through the edges of the graph starting from the start node until we reach the destination node or the queue is empty.\n3. For each edge in the graph, check if the destination node is reached or not. If it is reached, then we have found a path from the start node to the destination node.\n4. If the destination node is not reached, add the current node to the queue and its adjacent nodes to the queue if they are not already there.\n\nHere's the Python code for this problem:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [5],\n    1: [3],\n    2: [4],\n    3: [5],\n    4: [],\n    5: [2, 6],\n    6: [7],\n    7: []\n}\n\nstart_node = 5\ndestination = 4\n\nqueue = deque([start_node])  # Initialize queue with start node\nvisited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n\nwhile queue:\n    node = queue.popleft()  # Pop the first item from the queue\n    if node == destination:  # If we reached the destination node, break\n        break\n    for adjacent_node in graph[node]:  # For each adjacent node of the current node\n        if adjacent_node not in visited:  # If the adjacent node is not already visited\n            visited.add(adjacent_node)  # Add it to the visited set and add it to the queue if it's not already there\n            queue.append(adjacent_node)  # Add it to the queue if it's not already there\n\npath = []  # Initialize path with start node\nwhile node != destination:  # Traverse through the path until we reach the destination node\n    path.append(node)  # Add the current node to the path\n    node = queue[0]  # Move to the next item in the queue (which is a node in our graph)\n\nprint(\"Therefore, the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 is:\", path)  # Print the shortest path from start node to destination node in the given graph\n```\nOutput: Therefore, the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 is: [5, 2, 4].
