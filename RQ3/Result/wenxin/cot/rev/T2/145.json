Create an empty queue Q to store the nodes that we will visit in the BFS.\n2. Initialize the queue with the starting node 8.\n3. Initialize a set of visited nodes V to keep track of nodes that have already been visited.\n4. Initialize a variable dist to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting node to the target node.\n5. Start BFS from node 8:\n\t* While Q is not empty:\n\t\t+ Extract the first node from Q (let's call it node x).\n\t\t+ If node x is equal to the target node 4, then we have found the shortest path. We can stop the search and return dist as the answer.\n\t\t+ For each node y connected to node x in the graph:\n\t\t\t- If node y is not in V:\n\t\t\t\t+ Add node y to Q and V.\n\t\t\t- Otherwise, update dist with the shortest distance from node x to node y plus the length of edge (y, x).\n6.
