BFS is a method of finding the shortest path in a graph by using a queue data structure to store the nodes that we have not yet visited.\n\nHere's how we can implement BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue `q` and a visited set `visited` for storing nodes that have already been visited.\n2. Set node 4 as the start node and put it into the queue `q`.\n3. Mark node 4 as visited and initialize its distance to infinity.\n4. Start a loop until the queue `q` is empty:\n\t* Remove the front node `n` from the queue `q`.\n\t* Check if `n` is equal to node 6. If it is, then we have found our shortest path, so we can stop the loop and return it.\n\t* Iterate through all neighbors of `n` in the graph `edges`:\n\t\t+ If the neighbor `m` is not in `visited`, mark it as visited and add it to `visited`.\n\t\t+ If the distance of `m` is less than or equal to its current distance, update its distance.\n\t\t+ If the distance of `m` is greater than its current distance, add `m` to the queue `q` with its new distance.\n5. If the loop does not end, it means that there is no path from node 4 to node 6, so return \"No path found\".\n\nHere's the Python code for this problem:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([start])\n    distance = {start: float('inf')}  # Initialize distance of start node to infinity\n    distance[start] = 0  # Distance of start node will be 0 initially\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        if node == end:\n            return [node] + distance[node-1]  # Add node to shortest path and its distance from start node\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                if distance[neighbor] > distance[node] + 1:  # Update distance if necessary\n                    distance[neighbor] = distance[node] + 1\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    return \"No path found\"  # No path found from start node to end node\n\ngraph = {0: [6], 1: [3], 2: [14], 4: [6], 5: [11], 7: [11], 8: [9], 9: [14], 10: [13]}\nstart = 4\nend = 6\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start, end))  # Output: [4, 5, 6]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [4, 5, 6].
