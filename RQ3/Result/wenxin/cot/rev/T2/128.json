Create an empty queue to store the nodes to be visited.\n2. Set the starting node (node 12) as the first node in the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to store the visited nodes.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t1. Remove the first node from the queue and add it to the visited set.\n\t2. For each of its neighbors in the graph, that are not already in the visited set:\n\t\t- If there is a path to the target node (node 6), then mark that neighbor as the new current node and continue to the next iteration.\n\t\t- If there is no path, skip this neighbor and continue to the next one.\n5.
