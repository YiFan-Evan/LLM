Here's how I would solve this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a set of visited nodes and a distance array, where the distance[i] will hold the distance from node 3 to node i. Initially, all distances will be set to infinity except for distance[3] = 0 (starting point).\n2. Iterate over all nodes in the graph. For each node i, check if it is a neighbor of node 3 (i.e., if there is an edge from node i to node 3). If it is, update the distance of node i to the minimum distance so far.\n3. Repeat step 2 until all nodes have been visited.\n4. The shortest path from node 3 to node 6 is the path with the minimum distance.\n\nHere's the Python code to solve this problem:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [7],\n    1: [4],\n    2: [3],\n    3: [5],\n    4: [6],\n    5: [6],\n    6: [7],\n}\nstart_node = 3\ntarget_node = 6\n\nvisited = set()  #
