Initialize an empty set of visited nodes and initialize a set of distances to all nodes as infinity. Initially, all distances are infinity except for the start node (node 4) which has a distance of 0.\n2. Iterate through all nodes in the graph until there are no more nodes to visit.\n3. For each node, check if it is already visited or has a distance of infinity. If it is not, mark it as visited and update its distance to the current node (node 4).\n4. Iterate through all edges that connect the current node with other nodes in the graph. If the destination node is equal to the target node (node 5), return the path from the current node to the target node (i.e., 4->5).\n5. Otherwise, keep increasing the distance of the adjacent node based on its edge weight until reaching a node that has already been visited or has a distance of infinity.\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until reaching the target node (node 5).\n\nHere's the Python code implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    visited = set()\n    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph['nodes']]}\n    distances[start_node] = 0\n    heap = [(0, start_node)]\n\n    while heap:\n        (distance, current_node) = heapq.heappop(heap)\n\n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            if current_node == target_node:\n                path = []\n                while current_node != target_node:\n                    path.append(current_node)\n                    current_node = distances[current_node]\n                path = path[::-1]  # Reverse the path to get the shortest path\n                return path\n            else:\n                for adjacent_node, weight in graph['edges'][current_node].items():\n                    new_distance = distance + weight\n                        if new_distance < distances[adjacent_node]:\n                            distances[adjacent_node] = new_distance\n                            heapq.heappush(heap, (new_distance, adjacent_node))\n    return None  # If no path was found between start and target nodes\n```\nIn this example, the shortest path from node 4 to node 5 is: 4->4->7->5, which is of length 3 and consists of the following nodes: 4, 7, and 5.
