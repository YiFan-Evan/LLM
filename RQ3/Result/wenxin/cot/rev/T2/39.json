Initialize the distance array with all nodes set to infinity except for the start node, which is set to 0. Also initialize the current shortest distance to infinity and the current path to an empty list.\n2. Set the start node as the current node.\n3. Iterate through the graph, updating the distance array and current shortest distance as you go. If a shorter path exists, update the current shortest distance and current path.\n4. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you reach the target node (node 5).\n\nIn this case, Dijkstra's algorithm would find a path from node 0 to node 5 with a total distance of 3 (0 -> 4 -> 5).
