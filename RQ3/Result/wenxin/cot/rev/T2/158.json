Set a variable called `dist` to store the distance from the start node to all nodes in the graph. Initially, set `dist[9]` to 0, as this is the starting node.\n2. Iterate through each node in the graph, starting with node 9. For each node, update its `dist` value by adding the distance from the node to its neighboring nodes.\n3. Once you've visited all nodes in the graph, you can find the shortest path by going through each node in the `dist` array and finding the shortest path to it.\n\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 9 to node 2 is: 9 -> 8 -> 7 -> 2.
