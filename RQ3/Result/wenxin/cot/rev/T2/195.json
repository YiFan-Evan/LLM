Define a boolean variable called \"visited\" to keep track of which nodes have been visited\n4. Iterate over the BFS until the destination node is reached or all nodes have been visited\n5. During each iteration, check if node 8 is in the queue\n\t* If it is, you've found the shortest path\n\t* If it's not, remove all adjacent nodes from the queue that haven't been visited yet and add them to the BFS\n6.
