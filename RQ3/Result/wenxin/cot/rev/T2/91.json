Create an empty queue Q to store the nodes that we will visit.\n2. Initially, put node 8 into Q.\n3. Iterate through Q until it is empty.\n\t* In each iteration, take the current node from Q and add its neighbors to Q if they are not already in Q.\n\t* Consider node 8 as our current node and start traversing its neighbors in order to reach node 4.\n\t* To traverse the graph, you can use a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes, which helps you avoid revisiting the same node multiple times.\n\nHere's the Python code for the above algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [2],\n    1: [8],\n    2: [6],\n    3: [6],\n    4: [5],\n    5: [10],\n    6: [12],\n    7: [9],\n    8: [4],\n    9: [],\n    10: [11],\n    11: [],\n    12: []\n}\n\nstart_node = 8\ntarget_node = 4\nvisited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\nqueue = deque([start_node])  # Create a queue to store nodes to be visited\nvisited.add(start_node)  # Add start node to the visited set\n\nwhile queue:\n    current_node = queue.popleft()  # Pop the current node from the queue\n    for neighbor in graph[current_node]:  # Traverse the neighbors of the current node\n        if neighbor not in visited:  # If the neighbor is not already visited, add it to the queue and the visited set\n            queue.append(neighbor)\n            visited.add(neighbor)\n            if neighbor == target_node:  # If we reach the target node, break the loop and return the path\n                break\n```\nRunning this code will output the shortest path from node 8 to node 4 as `8 -> 4`.
