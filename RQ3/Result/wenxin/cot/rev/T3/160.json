Start by initializing a priority queue (or heap) with the nodes in the graph that are not yet visited.\n2. Pop the node with the smallest priority from the queue and mark it as visited.\n3. Then, for each of its adjacent nodes that are not yet visited, update their priority by considering the cost of going from the current node to the adjacent node and then to the target node.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes have been visited.\n\nIn this case, the starting node is 16 and the target node is 2. The priority of each node is its distance from the target node.\n\nHere's how you can implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Graph represented as adjacency list\ngraph = {\n    0: [8],\n    1: [12],\n    2: [13],\n    3: [19, 12],\n    4: [14, 19],\n    5: [10, 12],\n    6: [17, 19],\n    7: [15, 17],\n    8: [],\n    9: [20],\n    10: [20],\n    #
