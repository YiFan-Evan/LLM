Create an empty queue Q to store the nodes that we will visit in the BFS.\n2. Initialize a visited list to keep track of nodes that have already been visited.\n3. Initialize a distance list to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting node to each node.\n4. Add node 10 to Q and set its distance to 0.\n5. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Remove the first node from Q (let's call it node X).\n\t2. If node X is not equal to our target node (node 9), then:\n\t\t* Add its adjacent nodes (according to the given graph) to Q and update their distances in the distance list by adding the distance from X to X to Y (where Y is the adjacent node).\n\t\t* Mark node X as visited in the visited list.\n6. After completing the BFS, the shortest path will be the sequence of nodes in the distance list, starting from node 10 to node 9.\n\nHere's the Python code for this problem:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# Graph represented as adjacency list\ngraph = {\n    0: [9],\n    1: [9],\n    2: [8],\n    3: [5],\n    4: [8],\n    5: [11, 12],\n    6: [10],\n    7: [8],\n    8: [11],\n}\n\nstart_node = 10\ntarget_node = 9\n\n# Create a queue and initialize visited and distance lists\nQ = deque()\nvisited = set()\ndistance = []\nQ.append(start_node)\ndistance.append(0)\nvisited.add(start_node)\n\nwhile Q:\n    # Remove the first node from Q and add its adjacent nodes if not visited before\n    node = Q.popleft()\n    for neighbor in graph[node]:\n        if neighbor not in visited:\n            visited.add(neighbor)\n            Q.append(neighbor)\n            distance.append(distance[node] + 1)\n            break  # Only add one neighbor to the path for simplicity.
