Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Initialize a visited set to keep track of nodes that have been visited during the search. Initially, all nodes are unvisited.\n3. Initialize a path variable to keep track of the shortest path found so far. Initially, it should be an empty list.\n4. Start with node 5 as the current node.\n5. Add node 5 to the queue Q and set its visited flag to true.\n6. Start a while loop until the queue Q is empty:\n\t* Dequeue the first node from the queue Q (i.e., node 5).\n\t* If the dequeued node is equal to node 1, then we have found our shortest path and can stop the search.\n\t* Otherwise, add all adjacent nodes of the dequeued node to the queue Q and set their visited flags to true.\n\t* Update the path variable with the dequeued node and its adjacent nodes as part of the path.\n7.
