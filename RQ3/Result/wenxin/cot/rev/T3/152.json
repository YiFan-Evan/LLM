Create an empty queue Q to store the nodes that we will visit in the BFS.\n2. Initialize the queue Q with node 11 as the starting node.\n3. Initialize a set of visited nodes V to keep track of nodes that have already been visited.\n4. Initialize a variable dist to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting node to the target node. Initially, set dist to infinity.\n5. Start BFS:\n\t* In each iteration, add all nodes in Q to V that have not been visited before (i.e., if Q[i] is not in V, then add it to V).\n\t* If the current node is the target node (i.e., V contains the target node), then we have found the shortest path and can stop the search.\n\t* Otherwise, set dist to the minimum of dist and Q[i].dist, where Q[i].dist is the distance from Q[i] to its neighbor in Q[i].next (this is the distance from node i to its neighbor in the graph).\n\t* Continue until all nodes in Q have been visited.\n6. Return dist as the shortest path from node 11 to node 3.\n\nHere's the Python code for this problem:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, target):\n    Q = deque([start])\n    V = set()\n    dist = float('inf')\n    visited = []\n\n    while Q:\n        # Remove nodes that have already been visited from queue\n        for i in list(Q):\n            if i not in V:\n                Q.remove(i)\n                V.add(i)\n        # Calculate distances from start node to its neighbors in next and store them in visited[] list for reference purpose in later iterations. \n        next = [j for j in graph[i] if j not in visited]\n        visited = next + visited[:-1]\n        # Update shortest distance if any of the neighbors is target node or if it is smaller than current shortest distance. \n        if target in V or len(Q) == 0 or dist == float('inf') or dist > Q[0].dist:\n            dist = min(dist, Q[0].dist)\n    return dist\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->7->8->9->3\uff0cwhich is the shortest path from node 11 to node 3 in the given graph."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 14], [1, 6], [1, 13], [1, 12], [2, 12], [3, 4], [4, 12], [5, 11], [7, 8], [7, 10], [8, 9], [10, 13], [11, 12]]} The start node: 11 The destination: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u5df2\u6536\u5230\u60a8\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff1a\n\n\u6839\u636e\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b9\uff0811\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff089\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u662f\uff1a\n\n11 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9\n\n\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728\u56fe\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u8282\u70b911\u5230\u8282\u70b97\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u662f6\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u8282\u70b97\u5230\u8282\u70b98\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u662f3\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4ece\u8282\u70b98\u5230\u8282\u70b99\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u4e5f\u662f3\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u603b\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u662f6+3+3=12\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u3002\n\n\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b54\u6848\u57fa\u4e8e\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u8282\u70b9\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u56fe\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u8282\u70b9\u6216\u8fb9\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u8282\u70b9\u5217\u8868\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6709\u6240\u4e0d\u540c\u3002"}]
