The steps are as follows:\n\n1. Create an empty priority queue, with all the start node 1 at the front.\n2. Loop until the queue is empty:\n\t- Take the node with the smallest priority from the queue and remove it.\n\t- For each edge connected to the current node, check if the target node is reached by following this edge. If it is, mark the target node as visited and increase its priority by adding the distance to the edge.\n\t- If reaching the target node is not possible, repeat this step for the next node in the queue.\n\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 is 1->2->4, which has a total distance of 3. The priority of each edge is simply the distance to the target node, so for example, edge 1->2 has a priority of 2 (because it goes to node 2 which is on the shortest path to node 3), and edge 2->4 has a priority of 1 (because it directly goes to node 4 which is also on the shortest path to node 3)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 2 has a priority of 2 (because it goes to node 2 which is on the shortest path to node 3), and edge 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, I misunderstood your question. You are right. The destination node 2 has a priority of 2 because it is on the shortest path to node 3. The correct answer is:\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 2 is: 1->2\n\nI will update my answer accordingly."}]
