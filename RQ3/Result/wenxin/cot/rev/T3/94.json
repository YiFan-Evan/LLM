Create a priority queue, PQ, that will hold the nodes with the shortest distances from the starting node. Initially, all nodes will have infinite distances.\n2. Add node 10 to PQ with an infinite distance.\n3. While PQ is not empty:\n\t- Extract the node with the smallest distance from PQ. Let's call this node `current_node`.\n\t- Check if `current_node` is equal to the destination node `1`. If it is, return the path from PQ to `current_node`.\n\t- For each neighbor of `current_node` that has not been visited yet:\n\t\t+ Add the neighbor to PQ with a distance equal to the distance from `current_node` to `destination` plus the length of the edge between `current_node` and the neighbor.\n\t\t+ Mark the neighbor as visited.\n4.
