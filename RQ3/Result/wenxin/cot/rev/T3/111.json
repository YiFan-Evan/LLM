To do this, we need to follow the edges in the graph starting from node 3 until we reach node 11.\n\nStep 3: We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.

This forms a breadth-first search path.\n            shortest_path.append(neighbor)  # Store the path from the target node to this node. It's shortest path until now.\n        elif neighbor not in shortest_path:  # If this neighbor has already been added to shortest_path and we're adding it again, then it means there's a shorter path to this neighbor too. We can skip it in next iteration.\n            queue.remove(neighbor)  # Remove this neighbor from queue to prevent unnecessary backtracking. This ensures we don't follow an unnecessary path in future iterations.\n            shortest_path.remove(neighbor)  # Remove this neighbor from shortest_path as it is already covered in the previous shortest path and this may cause confusion.\n        elif len(shortest_path) == len(queue):  # If all nodes are visited in shortest_path and queue still contains more nodes to visit, then we've reached a dead end in our current shortest path.
