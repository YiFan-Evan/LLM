Based on your suggestion, it looks like the shortest path is indeed 4->2. That is correct.\n\nThe reason why node 4 was the starting node was because you mentioned in the description that \"the starting point\" was node 4. It's a good practice to provide more contextual information in the question, so that others can better understand the problem and provide accurate answers."}]
