Initialize an empty queue to store the starting node.\n2. Set the distance of each node to be equal to infinity except for the starting node (set it to 0).\n3. Enqueue the start node (1).\n4. Iterate over the queue while it's not empty:\n\t* Dequeue the first node from the queue (current node).\n\t* Check if the current node is the destination node (4). If it is, return the path.\n\t* For each edge that connects the current node to another node:\n\t\t+ Increment the distance of the target node by 1.\n\t\t+ Enqueue the target node.\n5.
