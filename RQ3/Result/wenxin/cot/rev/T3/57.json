Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Initialize a visited set to keep track of nodes that have already been visited. Initialize it with an empty set.\n3. Initialize a path set to keep track of the shortest path found so far. Initialize it with an empty list.\n4. Add node 0 to the queue Q and mark it as visited.\n5. Repeat the following steps until the queue Q is empty:\n\na. Dequeue a node u from the queue Q.\n\nb. If node u is the destination node 1, then stop the search and return the path set as the final answer.\n\nc. Mark all of node u's neighbors as visited (if they are not already visited).\n\nd.
