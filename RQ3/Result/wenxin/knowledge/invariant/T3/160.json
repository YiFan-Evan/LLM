The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Since `z` starts at `i` and decreases by 1 with each iteration, we are always swapping with an element after `arr[i]`, i.e., with an element that is greater than `arr[i]`. This ensures that the `arr[i]` element becomes the smallest element of the current sorted subarray.\n* After each iteration of the inner loop, we move to the next element in the array by incrementing `a`. This ensures that the next element in the sorted subarray is greater than or equal to the previous one.\n* Therefore, after each iteration of the outer loop, the sorted subarray becomes larger and larger, and all elements in it are in ascending order.\n* Since we start with an arbitrary order and end with an array in ascending order, the invariant holds for all i.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant proves the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    a = len(arr)\n    while a > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        a -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528`i`\u6765\u8868\u793a\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u8bd5\u56fe\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528`len(arr)`\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u8bd5\u56fe\u4f7f\u7528`arr[z - 1]`\u548c`arr[z]`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e34\u65f6\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u4e34\u65f6\u4ea4\u6362\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}]
