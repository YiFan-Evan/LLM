[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

In the previous question, you mentioned that the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the selection sort algorithm is `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[k-1]`. However, in your current code, you seem to be reversing the index in the inner loop.\n\nHere's a corrected version of your code:\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 1:\n        first_non_sorted_element = 1\n        while first_non_sorted_element < n:\n            if arr[first_non_sorted_element] > arr[n-1]:\n                break\n            first_non_sorted_element += 1\n        n = first_non_sorted_element\n    return arr\n```\nIn this corrected version, we start by identifying the first non-sorted element in the array. If the first non-sorted element is greater than the last element in the array, then we know that the array is already sorted and we can stop the algorithm. Otherwise, we move to the next iteration of the outer loop, which will continue to move through the remaining unsorted elements and identify them in ascending order. When we reach the end of the array without finding any unsorted elements, we know that the array is completely sorted and we can return it."}]
