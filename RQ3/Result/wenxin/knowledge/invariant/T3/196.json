The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

At the start of the i-th iteration, `arr[i]` is the element we are considering.\n2. We move to the next element `arr[i+1]` and compare it with `arr[q]`, which is the element in the sorted part of the array that we are moving towards.\n3. If `arr[i+1]` is less than `arr[q]`, we swap them, which moves `arr[q]` closer to `arr[i]`.\n4. We continue moving towards the end of the array, checking if there are elements that are less than `arr[q]`. If there are, we swap them with `arr[q]` to further sort it.\n5. At the end of the inner loop, `arr[i+1]` is checked again against `arr[q]` and swapped if necessary.\n6. Since we keep moving towards the end of the array and swapping if necessary, the sorted part of the array becomes smaller and smaller as we go along, proving that `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[q]` is still true after each iteration.\n\nSo, the loop invariant holds true for each iteration of the selection sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    q = len(arr)\n    while q > 0:\n        q -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[q]:\n                temp = arr[q]\n                arr[q] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u662f `q` \u548c `z` \u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c `q` \u53d8\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u800c `z` \u662f\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c`arr[i]` \u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u6539\u4e3a `arr[q]`\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    for q in range(len(arr)):\n        temp = arr[q]\n        for z in range(q):\n            if arr[z] < temp:\n                arr[z], arr[q] = arr[q], arr[z]\n        # \u7ed3\u675f\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u540e\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u7f6e q \u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8981\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\n        q = q + 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u9009\u62e9\u5269\u4f59\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9009\u62e9\u5269\u4f59\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u503c\u4ea4\u6362\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u66f4\u65b0 `q` \u4ee5\u68c0\u67e5\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
