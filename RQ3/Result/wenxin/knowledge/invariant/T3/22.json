At the start of each iteration, `min_value` is initialized to the first element of the array `arr`. Therefore, `min_value` is initially greater than or equal to all elements of the array.\n2. Then, the loop iterates through each element of the array `arr` and compares it with `min_value`. If an element is less than `min_value`, it is assigned to `min_value`. Therefore, at the end of each iteration, `min_value` contains the smallest value in the array.\n3.
