The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

I can help you prove the partial correctness of this Python program with a loop invariant.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the program is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i - 1] <= arr[i - 2] <= ...`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop. Here's why:\n\n1. Initially, the invariant holds true because the first element in the array is checked and it is compared with the next element.\n2. In the first iteration, the inner loop checks whether the current element is greater than its previous element, and if it is, it swaps them. This maintains the invariant until it reaches its previous position.\n3. In the second iteration, the current element is compared with its successor element. Since its predecessor is already swapped, the current element must be smaller than its successor. Hence, no swapping occurs and the invariant is maintained for its successor element.\n4. The same process continues for each iteration, maintaining the invariant until all elements have been checked.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant proves that the program performs insertion sort correctly for each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = len(arr)\n    while r > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        r -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77\uff0c\u6211\u8bef\u89e3\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5b83\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u597d\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u9700\u8981\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8be5\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u6b63\u786e\u653e\u7f6e\u5b83\u3002\n\n\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\uff0c\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[r-1]`\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\uff0c\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b83\u4f1a\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
