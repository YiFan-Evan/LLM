[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, if the loop is changed to iterate from the end to the beginning, the array index in the loop invariant should be adjusted to the latter part.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        z = i + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the selection sort algorithm is:\n\n`arr_sorted[i] <= arr_sorted[i+1] <= ... <= arr_sorted[z]`\n\nwhere `arr_sorted` is the sorted array.\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the sorted array `arr_sorted` are in ascending order. It is maintained throughout the while loop iterations.\n\nNote that in each iteration, we keep moving `i` by 1 position right after the swap operation in the inner while loop, until `i` reaches the end of the unsorted part of the array. Therefore, at each iteration, `i` will always point to the left-most unsorted element that has not yet been compared with the rest of the elements in the sorted array.\n\nAlso note that the invariant ensures that `arr[i]` is always the smallest element in its current unsorted part of the array, and `arr[z]` is always the largest element in its current unsorted part of the array.\n\nTherefore, this invariant proves the partial correctness of the provided selection sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        i -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided code is correct and implements the selection sort algorithm.
