Initially, the loop invariant states that the value of `mid_value` is equal to `give_mid(arr[i])` for the first iteration. This is because the function `give_mid` is called with the value of `arr[i]` as its argument, and the result is assigned to `mid_value`.\n2. The loop invariant is then updated after each iteration, ensuring that it holds true for the next iteration. In each iteration, `p` is incremented by 1, and `mid_value` is updated with the value of `arr[p]`. Therefore, the updated loop invariant for the next iteration is `mid_value_value = give_mid(arr[p])`\n3. After the loop finishes, the invariant holds true because it states that `mid_value` has been set to the median value of the array, which is what the function `give_mid` is designed to return.\n\nSo, the invariant ensures that at each iteration, `mid_value` is correctly updated with the median value of the array. This proves the partial correctness of the provided program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    p = len(arr)\n    while 2 * p < len(arr):\n        p -= 1\n        mid_value = arr[p]\n    return mid_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u7406\u89e3\u4e86\u60a8\u7684\u8981\u6c42\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e3a\u60a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff1a\n\n\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e00\u4e2aPython\u51fd\u6570`give_mid(arr)`\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4`arr`\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u3002\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u7d22\u5f15`p`\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u4e00\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06`mid_value`\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a`p`\u7684\u503c\u3002\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230`p`\u7b49\u4e8e0\u6216\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u8fd4\u56de\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5728i-th\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a8\u6240\u9700\u8981\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u5e94\u8be5\u4ee5\u5982\u4e0b\u5f62\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\uff1a\n\n`mid_value_value = give_mid(arr[i])`\n\n\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728i-th\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u3002"}]
