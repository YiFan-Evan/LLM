[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop invariant I suggest for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`arr[i] == target_value`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the target element is found in the array and the index of the target is updated accordingly.\n\nHowever, if you want to prove the partial correctness of the program, you can use the invariant `p < len(arr)` for the i-th iteration of the loop, which ensures that the loop will iterate through all elements of the array.\n\nSo, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop would be:\n\n`p < len(arr) and arr[i] == target_value`\n\nPlease note that this invariant only proves partial correctness of the program and does not provide a complete proof for correctness.
