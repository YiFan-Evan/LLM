I understand the problem you described. Now, I will provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the provided Python program to prove its partial correctness.\n\nLoop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n\n```python\narr[i] <= arr[i-1]\n```\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop. It is based on the algorithm used in insertion sort, which moves an element to its correct position in the sorted array by comparing it with the elements around it.\n\nHere's why this invariant holds:\n\n1. Initially, `arr[i]` is the i-th element in the array, which is smaller than or equal to the elements before it.\n2. In the first while loop, `z` is set to `i` and incremented until it reaches 0 or an element smaller than `arr[i]`. This ensures that `arr[i]` is smaller than or equal to all elements before it.\n3. After moving `arr[i]` to its correct position, `arr[i-1]` becomes the new smallest element in its subarray, which is smaller than or equal to all elements in it.\n4. Since `arr[i-1]` is smaller than `arr[i]`, the invariant holds for the next iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, this invariant proves that the provided Python program correctly sorts the array using insertion sort."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = len(arr)\n    while b > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        b -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5199\u7684\u662f`z = i`\uff0c\u4f46\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662f`arr[z - 1]`\u548c`arr[z]`\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u8868\u793a\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u4e3a\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u53d8\u91cf`current`\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        current = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > current:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = current\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u91cd\u590d\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u90fd\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u4e2a\u503c\uff0c\u8be5\u503c\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u503c\u5927\u6216\u76f8\u7b49\u3002\u627e\u5230\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5927\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u91cd\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u6392\u5e8f\u5b8c\u6210\u3002"}]
