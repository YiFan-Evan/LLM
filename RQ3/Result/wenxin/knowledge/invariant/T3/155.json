[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, if the loop is changed to iterate from the end to the beginning, the array index in the loop invariant should be adjusted to the latter part.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = 0\n    while p < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n        p += 1\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the given program is:\n\n`arr[i] + arr[i+1] + ... + arr[p] <= sum_value`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the sum of the elements in the current iteration of the loop is less than or equal to the value of `sum_value` at the beginning of the iteration. It proves that the program correctly computes the sum of the elements in the array.\n\nThe invariant holds at the start of each iteration because `sum_value` is initialized to 0 and `p` is set to 0.
