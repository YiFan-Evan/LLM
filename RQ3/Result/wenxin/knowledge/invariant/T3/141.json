[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, if the loop is changed to iterate from the end to the beginning, the array index in the loop invariant should be adjusted to the latter part.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    b = 0\n    while b < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[b]\n        b += 1\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the given program is:\n\n`arr[i] + arr[i+1] + ... + arr[b] <= sum_value`\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Initially, `sum_value` is set to 0, so it's a valid starting point for the loop invariant.\n* `b` is initially set to 0, so it tracks the current index in the array.\n* At each iteration, we add an element from the array to `sum_value`, so `sum_value` becomes larger.\n* Finally, after the loop, `sum_value` is returned as the result, so it should be true that the sum of all elements in the array is at least as large as `sum_value`.\n\nNote that this loop invariant assumes that the array is sorted in ascending order.
