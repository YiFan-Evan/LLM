The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

I can help you prove the partial correctness of this Python program with a loop invariant.\n\nHere's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the provided program:\n\n\n```python\narr[i-1] <= arr[i]\n```\nThe invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop. It is based on the insertion sort algorithm, which moves an element to its correct position in the sorted array by comparing it with the elements around it.\n\nHere's how the invariant is used to prove the partial correctness of the program:\n\n1. In the first iteration of the outer loop (`while j < len(arr)`), the invariant holds because there are no elements in the array yet (`j == 0`).\n2. Inside the inner loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`), the invariant is maintained because `arr[z - 1]` is always less than or equal to `arr[z]`. This loop moves `arr[z]` to its correct position in the sorted array, ensuring that `arr[i-1] <= arr[i]` holds for the current iteration.\n3. After each iteration of the inner loop, `j` is incremented, which moves to the next element in the array (`arr[j]`). Therefore, the invariant continues to hold for each element in the array after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\nTherefore, the provided program fulfills the requirements of a sorted array after each iteration of the loop, and the invariant ensures that this condition holds for each iteration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = len(arr)\n    while j > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        j -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5199\u7684\u662f`arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`\uff0c\u4f46\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5e94\u8be5\u662f`arr[z] > arr[z - 1]`\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u5728`while j > 0`\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u6ca1\u6709\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5b83\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982`j`\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = len(arr) - 1\n    while j > 0:\n        for i in range(j):\n            if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:\n                arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]\n            else:\n                break\n        j -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5730\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u68c0\u67e5\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u662f\u5426\u5927\u4e8e\u5176\u53f3\u4fa7\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u5219\u4ea4\u6362\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e0d\u518d\u5927\u4e8e\u5176\u53f3\u4fa7\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4e3a\u6b62\uff0c\u6b64\u65f6\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5c06\u5411\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5373`j`\u51cf\u4e00\u3002\u6700\u540e\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
