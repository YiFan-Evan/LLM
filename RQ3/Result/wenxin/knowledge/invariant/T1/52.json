[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This invariant ensures that the count value correctly reflects the number of occurrences of the target value in the array.\n\nThe invariant ensures that each iteration of the loop correctly increases the count value by 1 if the current element in the array is equal to the target value, and by 1 each time m is incremented, ensuring that we visit all elements in the array once and only once.\n\nIf we change the loop condition from \"< len(arr)\" to \"<= len - 1\", then the loop invariant remains unchanged.
