The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Therefore, this invariant ensures that `last_value` represents the maximum value in the current window of elements in the array `arr`.\n* After the loop, the invariant ensures that `last_value` is the last value of the array, since it was updated to represent the maximum value within the current window of elements.\n\nTherefore, this loop invariant proves the partial correctness of the provided program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_last(arr):\n    last_value = arr[0]\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        last_value = arr[h]\n        h += 1\n    return last_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided program is correct and fulfills its intended purpose.
