[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

However, if you change the loop condition from `j <= len(arr) - 1` to `j < len(arr)` (i.e., you remove the -1), then the loop invariant would no longer hold for len(arr) = 0. Therefore, it is necessary to check that the loop condition is always valid for a valid input length."}]
