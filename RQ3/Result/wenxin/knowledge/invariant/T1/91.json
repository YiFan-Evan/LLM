It ensures that the value of `last_value` at the end of the loop will be the last value of the array.\n\nThe invariant is maintained by the loop condition `l < len(arr)` which ensures that the index `l` is always within the bounds of the array `arr`.\n\nIn the case where the loop condition changes from `< len to <= len - 1`, the loop invariant remains unchanged because it is independent of the loop condition.
