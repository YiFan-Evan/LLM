[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It also assumes that the array is initially sorted in ascending order, which is why the maximum value is initially set to the first element of the array.\n\nNote that if you change the loop condition from `< len to <= len - 1` to `<= len`, then you need to modify the invariant accordingly to ensure that it still holds true. In this case, you would need to update `f += 1` to `f += 2` because `f` now points to the next element after the maximum value found so far.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or need further clarification!"}]
