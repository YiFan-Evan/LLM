[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The original code was:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = 0\n    while s < len(arr):\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        s += 1\n    return arr\n```\nHowever, you've changed the variable `i` to `z` in the inner loop. This is a mistake because `i` and `z` have different meanings in this context. You need to change `i` to `s` for the inner loop. Correcting this, the code would be:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = 0\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:  # Note the change from <= to < here\n        s += 1  # This is also a change from <= to <\n        while s > 0 and arr[s - 1] > arr[s]:  # Note the change from z to s here\n            temp = arr[s]\n            arr[s] = arr[s - 1]\n            arr[s - 1] = temp\n            s -= 1  # Again, note the change from z to s here\n    return arr\n```\nWith these corrections, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm remains the same as before: `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[s-1]`. It ensures that elements are inserted in ascending order of values into the correct positions in the array. It is maintained by the inner while loop that swaps elements if they are in the wrong order."}]
