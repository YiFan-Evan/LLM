[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, even if the loop condition changes from < len to <= len - 1, the loop invariant should remain unchanged.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = 0\n    while p < len(arr):\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n        p += 1\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the `give_sum` loop is:\n\n`arr_p_value = fun(arr[arr_p] - arr[arr_p-1])`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the sum of the elements in the array is correctly calculated.
