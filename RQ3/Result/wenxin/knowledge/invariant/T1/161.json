The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Let's define the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop as:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[n-1]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order. Here's an explanation of why this invariant holds for each iteration of the loop:\n\n1. Before the first iteration: Initially, the array is unsorted and has no duplicate elements. So, this invariant holds before any iteration.\n2. During each iteration: In the first part of the outer loop, the value of i is incremented, which ensures that arr[i] <= arr[i+1] is satisfied for each iteration. Then, inside the inner loop, we compare arr[i] with arr[i-1] and swap them if necessary. This ensures that arr[i] <= arr[i-1] and arr[i-1] <= arr[i+1] are satisfied for each iteration. Therefore, this invariant holds for each iteration of the inner loop.\n3. After each iteration: After each iteration of the outer loop, we increment b by 1, which ensures that we are still within the array bounds. Therefore, this invariant holds after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion_sort function is: `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[n-1]`. It proves the partial correctness of the program by showing that the invariant holds for each iteration of the loop and ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = 0\n    while b <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        b += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`z`\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728Python\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u88ab\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u3002\u56e0\u4e3aPython\u662f\u533a\u5206\u5927\u5c0f\u5199\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5`i`\u548c`z`\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6539\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\n\n\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`z`\u7684\u8d4b\u503c\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u6761\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c`i`\u88ab\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u793a\u4f8b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = 0\n    while b < len(arr):\n        temp = arr[b]\n        while temp < arr[b - 1]:  # \u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u6bd4\u8f83\n            b -= 1  # \u5982\u679c\u5df2\u7ecf\u6bd4\u8f83\u5230\u4e86\u5f00\u5934\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u5c0f\u4e8etemp\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c31\u8df3\u51fa\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\n        arr.insert(b, temp)  # \u5728\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d2\u5165\u5143\u7d20\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u5b83\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5f00\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u5e94\u8be5\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u7ec4\u662f\u6309\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u7684\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u968f\u65f6\u5411\u6211\u63d0\u95ee\u3002"}]
