[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This ensures that `sum_value` will have the correct sum at the end of the loop.\n* The loop condition is `b <= len(arr) - 1`, which means the loop iterates at most `len(arr) - 1` times.
