[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, even if the loop condition changes from < len to <= len - 1, the loop invariant should remain unchanged.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    while q < len(arr):\n        z = q + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[q]:\n                temp = arr[q]\n                arr[q] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the selection sort algorithm is:\n\n* `arr_sorted[i] <= arr_sorted[i+1] <= ... <= arr_sorted[q]`\n\nwhere `arr_sorted` is the sorted array and `q` is the index of the first unsorted element.\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the unsorted part of the array are in increasing order, and that the sorted part of the array is also increasing.
