[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It is checked by the outer while loop and used to update the array during each iteration.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The outer while loop checks the condition `e < len(arr)` which ensures that the array is not completely sorted yet.\n* The inner while loop checks if the element at position z is smaller than the element at position e. If this is the case, it swaps the elements. This ensures that the element at position e is always the smallest element in its subarray.\n* After each iteration of the inner loop, the value of e is increased by 1, which means that the outer loop moves to the next unsorted subarray.\n* The invariant ensures that this process continues until all elements are sorted.\n\nThis invariant ensures that the selection sort algorithm performs correctly and proves its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = e + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[e]:\n                temp = arr[e]\n                arr[e] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your code for selection sort is almost correct, but there is a minor issue with the condition in the outer while loop.
