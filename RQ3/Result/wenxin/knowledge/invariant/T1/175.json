The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It is maintained by the while loop that swaps elements until the end of the array is reached.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of how this invariant is maintained:\n\n* Initially, `p` is set to 0, so `arr[p]` is the first element of the array that is not yet sorted.\n* The inner while loop checks if `arr[z]` (the element before `arr[p]`) is greater than `arr[p]`. If this is true, it means that `arr[p]` needs to be moved to its correct position, which is the position before `arr[z]`.\n* This is done by swapping `arr[z]` and `arr[p]`, then decreasing `z` by 1.\n* After this swap, `arr[p+1]` becomes the next element in the sorted part of the array, so `arr[p+1] <= arr[p+2] <= ... <= arr[i-1]`.\n* Since we keep moving `p` forward as long as it is less than `len(arr)`, we maintain the invariant that `arr[p] <= arr[p+1] <= ... <= arr[i-1]`.\n\nSo, the loop invariant proves that the insertion sort algorithm partially corrects the provided program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = 0\n    while p <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        p += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u5982`i`\u548c`z`\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0b\u5212\u7ebf\u6216\u8005\u9a7c\u5cf0\u547d\u540d\u6cd5\u6765\u547d\u540d\u4f60\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = 0\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = arr[p]\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > z:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z = arr[z - 1]\n        p += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`arr[p]`\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u9700\u8981\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u800c`arr[z - 1]`\u662f\u6bd4`arr[p]`\u5c0f\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u5916\u5c42\u7684while\u5faa\u73af\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06`arr[p]`\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c\u5185\u5c42\u7684while\u5faa\u73af\u5219\u7528\u4e8e\u627e\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u6216\u4e2d\u7b49\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u9519\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}]
