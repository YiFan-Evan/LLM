Here's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n`arr[t] <= arr[t-1] <= ... <= arr[0]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop.\n\nHere's how the invariant is maintained:\n\n1. In the first iteration, `arr[t]` is `arr[0]` and it is compared with `arr[0]`. Since `arr[0]` is smaller than `arr[t]`, the loop condition is satisfied and the code inside the inner while loop is executed.\n2. Inside the inner while loop, the elements are swapped if necessary to maintain the invariant. This ensures that `arr[t]` becomes smaller than `arr[t-1]`.\n3. After each iteration, `t` is incremented by 1, so `arr[t]` becomes `arr[t+1]`. This ensures that `arr[t+1]` is also smaller than `arr[t]`, maintaining the invariant.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop, proving its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    t = 0\n    while t <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        t += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b83\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6211\u5047\u8bbe\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u4f7f\u7528`arr[z - 1]`\u7684\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d22\u5f15\u6765\u66f4\u65b0\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u7ec4\u8d8a\u754c\u9519\u8bef\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    t = 0\n    while t < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = t + 1\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            arr[z], arr[z - 1] = arr[z - 1], arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        t += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u7d22\u5f15\u88ab\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a`t + 1`\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u8d8a\u754c\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5373\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`t`\u3002\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e86\u3002"}]
