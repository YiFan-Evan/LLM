[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The invariant still ensures that the correct value is retrieved for the desired member ID `id`, but it may not necessarily prove the full correctness of the program, as it assumes that the loop condition is always met. Therefore, it is recommended to review the specific implementation of `give_member` function to ensure that it fulfills all requirements."}]
