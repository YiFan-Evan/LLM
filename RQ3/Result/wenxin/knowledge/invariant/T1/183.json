It holds at the start of each iteration and is maintained by the selection sort algorithm.\n\nHere's an explanation of how the invariant is maintained:\n\n1. Initially, `arr[i]` is compared with `arr[d]`, where `d` is the current index of the sorted part of the array.\n2. If `arr[i]` is less than `arr[d]`, then it is swapped with `arr[d]`. This ensures that `arr[i]` becomes the smallest element in its sorted part.\n3. After swapping, `arr[i+1]` is compared with `arr[d]`. If `arr[i+1]` is less than `arr[d]`, then it is swapped with `arr[d]`. This maintains the ascending order in the sorted part of the array.\n4. After swapping, `d` is incremented by 1, which moves the sorted part to the right.\n\nThe invariant ensures that the elements in the sorted part of the array are in ascending order at all times, which proves the partial correctness of the selection sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    d = 0\n    while d <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = d + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[d]:\n                temp = arr[d]\n                arr[d] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        d += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\uff0c\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86Python\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\uff08Selection Sort\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u6bcf\u6b21\u4ece\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u653e\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u662f\uff1a\n\n`arr[d] <= arr[d+1] <= ... <= arr[z-1] <= arr[z]`\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f1a\u88ab\u7ef4\u62a4\u76f4\u5230\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u3002\n\n\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\uff0c`d`\u90fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a01\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u6211\u4eec\u6b63\u5728\u5c06\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5411\u53f3\u79fb\u52a8\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6211\u4eec\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u4f1a\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}]
