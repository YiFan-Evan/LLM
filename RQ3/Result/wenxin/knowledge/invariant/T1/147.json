[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This time, it's saying that the value of the element at index i in the array is equal to the sum of all the elements in the array up to and excluding index i-1.\n\nThis is because in each iteration of the loop, we are adding the value of the element at index h to the running total `sum_value`. Then, we increment `h` by 1, so the next iteration will be on the next element in the array. Since `h` now starts at 0 and we're excluding index 0, this means that we are adding all the elements in the array up to and excluding index `h` (which is equivalent to excluding index 0).\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant proves that the program is partially correct, because it correctly computes the sum of all the elements in the array up to and excluding the current index.
