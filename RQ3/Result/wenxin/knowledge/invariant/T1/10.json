[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, even if the loop condition changes from < len to <= len - 1, the loop invariant should remain unchanged.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    k = 0\n    while k < len(arr):\n        if arr[k] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[k]\n        k += 1\n    return max_value\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the `find_max` function is:\n\n\n```python\narr[i] > max_value_of_all_elements\n```\nThe invariant ensures that the value of `max_value` is always the maximum value among all elements in the array.\n\nIn each iteration of the loop, we compare the current element `arr[i]` with `max_value`.
