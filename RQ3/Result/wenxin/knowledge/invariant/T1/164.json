[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The outer while loop ensures that `i` (which should be `e` in the provided code) remains within the bounds of the array.\n\nTherefore, this invariant proves the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm.\n\nThe code itself seems fine and implements insertion sort correctly. However, there is a small issue with it: the variable `i` is not defined anywhere in the code, and I am assuming that you meant to use `e` instead.\n\nPlease note that for the same program, even if the loop condition changes from `< len(arr) to <= len(arr) - 1`, the loop invariant should remain unchanged. This is because insertion sort maintains the sorted order within each subarray of length 1 after each iteration, and this invariant holds for all subarrays of length up to and including the entire array."}]
