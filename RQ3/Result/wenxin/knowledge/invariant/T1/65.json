If it is, the `id_value` variable is updated to the current value of `i`. This invariant ensures that the `id_value` variable correctly tracks which element in the array matches the target.\n\nNote that this invariant assumes that `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared for equality, and that `target` is a value that will be matched by at least one element in the array.
