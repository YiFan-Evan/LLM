[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, even if the loop condition changes from < len to <= len - 1, the loop invariant should remain unchanged.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    n = 0\n    while n < len(arr):\n        if arr[n] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[n]\n        n += 1\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the provided program is:\n\n**min_value_value = fun(arr[min_value]->arr[min_value])**\n\nThe invariant ensures that the minimum value found so far is always updated in the `min_value` variable using the provided function `fun(arr[min_value]->arr[min_value])`. This function takes the current minimum value from the array and returns the next value in the array that is smaller than the current minimum value.\n\nThe invariant ensures that at each iteration, the minimum value found so far is compared with the next value in the array.
