[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It ensures that the value of `member_value` is equal to the value of `arr[member_value]` at each iteration.\n\nThe invariant also ensures that the value of `f` is incremented correctly within the loop. It ensures that the index `f` moves to the next element in the array `arr` after each iteration.\n\nThis invariant also ensures that the loop condition is met for all values of `id` in the array `arr`. The loop will iterate through all elements of the array, moving from one element to the next until it reaches `id` or the end of the array.\n\nThe invariant does not explicitly state that `f` is always less than or equal to the length of the array `arr`, but it is implied by the loop condition `f < len(arr)` and by the fact that `f` is incremented within each iteration.
