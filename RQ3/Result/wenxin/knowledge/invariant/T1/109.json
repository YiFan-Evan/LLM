[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It ensures that the program will retrieve the correct element at the target index `id` from the `arr` array, if it exists, and return its value as `member_value`."}]
