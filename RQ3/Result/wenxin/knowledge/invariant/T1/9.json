The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

However, as mentioned before, the loop invariant remains unchanged regardless of the loop condition.\n\nThis proof demonstrates that your provided loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of this program."}]
