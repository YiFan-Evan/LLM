[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, even if the loop condition changes from < len to <= len - 1, the loop invariant should remain unchanged.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    m = 0\n    while m < len(arr):\n        if arr[m] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return max_value\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the provided program is:\n\n`max_value_i = find_max(arr[m:i])`\n\nwhere `m` is the current index and `i` is the next index.\n\nThis invariant ensures that the maximum value found so far is always the maximum value in the current subarray `arr[m:i]`.
