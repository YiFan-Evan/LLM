[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It also ensures that the elements in the array are properly shifted as the algorithm proceeds through the array.\n\nHere's an explanation of how the invariant is maintained:\n\n1. In the first iteration, the invariant is set to `a_index = i` and `arr[a_index] <= arr[a_index - 1]` as the algorithm starts with the element at index `i`.\n2. The outer while loop iterates until `a` reaches the end of the array. This loop ensures that each element is processed at least once.\n3. Inside the outer loop, there's an inner while loop that compares elements within a window of size `z` (starting from `i`). This loop moves elements in the window to the correct position based on the invariant `arr[a_index] <= arr[a_index - 1]`.\n4. The invariant is maintained because at the end of each iteration, `arr[a_index]` becomes smaller than `arr[a_index - 1]`, which is what the inner loop checks for moving elements within the window.\n\nNote that this invariant only proves the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm, as it doesn't address all possible edge cases or corner conditions. However, it provides a sufficient condition to prove that each iteration correctly sorts a subarray of size `z + 1` in ascending order, as specified by the algorithm's function name."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    a = 0\n    while a <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        a += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662fPython\u4e2d\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06`i`\u6539\u4e3a`index`\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    a = 0\n    while a < len(arr) - 1:\n        index = a\n        while index > 0 and arr[index - 1] > arr[index]:\n            temp = arr[index]\n            arr[index] = arr[index - 1]\n            arr[index - 1] = temp\n            index -= 1\n        a += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f00\u59cb\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662fO(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002"}]
