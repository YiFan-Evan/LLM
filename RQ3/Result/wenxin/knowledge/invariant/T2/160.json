Let's define the loop invariant for the i-th iteration as follows:\n\n\n```less\narr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ...\n```\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop.\n\nNow, let's prove this invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The loop starts with `a = 0`, which means that we are considering the first element of the array `arr[0]` for sorting.\n2. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares `arr[z]` with `arr[z - 1]` and swaps them if necessary. This ensures that `arr[z] <= arr[z - 1]` holds after each iteration of the inner loop.\n3. **Increase a**: After the inner loop, `a` is incremented by 1, which means that we are considering the next element `arr[a+1]` for sorting.\n4. **Exit Condition**: The outer loop exits when `a` reaches the length of the array `len(arr)`. This ensures that all elements in the array are considered for sorting.\n\nTherefore, the invariant holds for each iteration of the loop, proving the partial correctness of the insertion_sort function."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    a = -1\n    while a < len(arr) - 1:\n        a += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u67e5\u627e\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`i` \u548c `z` \u90fd\u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u4e86 `a`\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5206\u522b\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c`i` \u548c `z` \u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4f60\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ...` \u8fd9\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u5e94\u8be5\u6539\u4e3a `arr[i] < arr[i+1] < arr[i+2] < ...` \uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u4fee\u6b63\u4e3a\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5f62\u5f0f\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u4e86\u3002"}]
