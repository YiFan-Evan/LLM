[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Your Python program contains a loop with the function selection_sort, which is a classic selection sort algorithm to sort an array. Now, in order to prove the partial correctness of the program for each iteration of the loop, I'll provide you with an invariant that expresses the relationship between array elements and indices.\n\nHere's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n\n```python\narr[r+1:z] = [arr[r+1:z][0], arr[r]] + arr[z+1:len(arr)]\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `arr[r+1:z]` represents the subarray from index `r+1` to `z` inclusive.\n* `arr[r]` is the minimum element in the current sorted subarray.\n* `arr[z+1:len(arr)]` represents the remaining unsorted subarray after considering the minimum element at index `r`.\n\nThe invariant ensures that at each iteration, the minimum element is moved to its correct position in the sorted subarray, and the remaining unsorted subarray is updated accordingly. This invariant proves the partial correctness of the program for each iteration of the loop.\n\nPlease note that if you change the loop variable `i` back to its original value minus one, you will need to adjust the array index in the invariant accordingly.\n\nNote: This invariant assumes that `arr` is a list or a numpy array. If you have provided a different type of input, please provide additional information to correctly formulate the invariant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        z = r + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[r]:\n                temp = arr[r]\n                arr[r] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5b83\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u6211\u65e0\u6cd5\u627e\u51fa\u4efb\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u3002\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5373\u6bcf\u6b21\u4ece\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u7f6e\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u968f\u65f6\u5411\u6211\u63d0\u95ee\u3002"}]
