[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If you want to calculate the sum of all elements, you should initialize `sum_value` to 0 before the loop and keep track of it instead of just storing the last element. Here's a corrected version:\n\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    for element in arr:\n        sum_value += element\n    return sum_value\n```\nThis corrected program correctly calculates the sum of all elements in the array."}]
