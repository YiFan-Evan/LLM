[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, if the loop variable is changed to its original value minus one, the array index in the loop invariant should be adjusted accordingly.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = 0\n    while s < len(arr):\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        s += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Your provided Python program `insertion_sort` appears to be an insertion sort algorithm implementation. Here's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n\n```python\nxxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])\n```\nThis invariant would be:\n\n\n```python\narr[i] = i + 1\n```\nThis invariant is true before the first iteration, because `arr[i]` is the element we are going to sort. It is also true after each iteration, because after each iteration, `arr[i]` is moved to its correct position within the sorted array. The invariant checks if this position has changed between iterations.\n\nRemember, if the loop variable is changed to its original value minus one, then you need to adjust the array index accordingly. If the variable `i` is used for loop control in this context, it is essential that it remains constant within the inner loop, otherwise the algorithm will not work correctly.\n\nAlso, I want to emphasize that this invariant only proves the partial correctness of the program up to the point where `arr[i]` is sorted. It does not prove that the entire array has been sorted. To prove that, you would need to provide an invariant for the end of the loop that proves that all elements have been sorted correctly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = -1\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\n        s += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4e5f\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u53d8\u5f0f\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n\n```python\nxxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx+1])\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd9\u6837\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c`arr[i]`\u90fd\u4f1a\u88ab\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5373`arr[i]`\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5176\u524d\u9762\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee5\u4e0b\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\uff1a\n\n1. \u5728\u5916\u5faa\u73af\u5f00\u59cb\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c`arr[i]`\u662f\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n2. \u5728\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6bd4\u8f83`arr[z]`\u548c`arr[z-1]`\u7684\u503c\u3002\u5982\u679c`arr[z]`\u5927\u4e8e`arr[z-1]`\uff0c\u5219\u6211\u4eec\u5c06`arr[z]`\u7684\u503c\u8d4b\u7ed9\u4e34\u65f6\u53d8\u91cf`temp`\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06`arr[z-1]`\u8d4b\u7ed9`arr[z]`\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5c06\u4e34\u65f6\u53d8\u91cf`temp`\u8d4b\u7ed9`arr[z-1]`\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\u5c31\u662f\u5728\u628a\u5143\u7d20\u5411\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u79fb\u52a8\u3002\n3. \u5185\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\uff0c`arr[i]`\u5e94\u8be5\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5373\u5b83\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5176\u524d\u9762\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u6240\u9700\u8981\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u3002\n\n\u5e0c\u671b\u8fd9\u4e2a\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u4f60\u6709\u6240\u5e2e\u52a9\uff01\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u968f\u65f6\u63d0\u95ee\u3002"}]
