[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This invariant proves the partial correctness of the algorithm, as it ensures that the elements are indeed sorted in ascending order.\n\nNote that if you change the loop variable j to its original value minus one, then you can simply drop the 'j += 1' statement in the inner while loop. Also, there's no need to decrement j again after you finish sorting a single element, so I removed that from the final version.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = j + 1\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z] < arr[j]:\n            temp = arr[j]\n            arr[j] = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        j += 1\n    return arr\n```\nThis corrected code still uses the same selection sort algorithm as before, but it ensures that the loop invariant is maintained correctly."}]
