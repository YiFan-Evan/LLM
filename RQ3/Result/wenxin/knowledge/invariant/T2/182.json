Let's define the loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the outer loop as `invariant_i`:\n\n`invariant_i = arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[i+n-1]`\n\nHere's the proof for the `i-th` iteration:\n\n1. **Before the first iteration**:\n\n\n\t* `invariant_0` holds because `arr` is initially unsorted.\n2. **Iteration of the main loop**:\n\n\n\t* Inside the inner loop, if `arr[z] < arr[c]`, then we swap `arr[c]` and `arr[z]`.\n\t* This ensures that the values in the current iteration are in sorted order (according to `arr`'s index) in the current iteration.\n\t* The inner loop ends when `z >= len(arr)`\n\t* The outer loop continues with the next iteration.\n3. **After each iteration**:\n\n\n\t* The value of `invariant_{i+1}` is computed as a combination of the `invariant_i` values of previous iterations, where we include `arr[i]` at the beginning, but not at the end (as it may have changed during swapping).\n\t* We increase `c` by 1, so that `arr[c]` is considered for comparison in the next iteration.\n\t* The invariant is preserved after each iteration.\n\nIn summary, this loop invariant proves that after each iteration of the `selection_sort` function, the array is sorted in ascending order.
