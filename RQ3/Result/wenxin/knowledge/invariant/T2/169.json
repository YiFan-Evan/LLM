The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Here's the reasoning behind it:\n\n1. \"j < len(arr)\": This ensures that we are still within the bounds of the array, so we can access the elements.\n2. \"arr[i] < arr[i - 1]\": This is the loop invariant for the inner while loop. It ensures that, as we go through the loop, the element at index i is smaller than the element at index i-1. This is because we are moving elements to their correct positions in the array using the while loop, so if we start with an element that is greater than its correct position, it will eventually move to its correct position, and so will all the elements after it.\n\nSo, if these conditions are true for each iteration of the loop, then it proves that the insertion_sort function is partially correct.\n\nNote: The code assumes that arr is a list of integers and that it is initially sorted in some order (not necessarily in ascending or descending order).insertion_sort sorts arr by moving elements from one sorted position to the next using comparisons and swaps until there are no more elements to move and the array is sorted in ascending order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        j += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6211\u4e3a\u4f60\u4fee\u6b63\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(arr):\n        temp = arr[j]\n        i = j - 1\n        while i >= 0 and arr[i] > temp:\n            arr[i+1] = arr[i]\n            i -= 1\n        j += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u6211\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u51e0\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff1a\n\n* \u5728 Python \u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u4ece 0 \u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u4f7f\u7528 `i` \u65f6\u9700\u8981\u51cf\u53bb 1\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u624d\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u83b7\u53d6\u6570\u7ec4\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n* \u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53d8\u91cf `z` \u548c `temp` \u7684\u542b\u4e49\u4e0d\u6e05\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06\u5176\u66f4\u6539\u4e3a\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u66f4\u5408\u9002\u7684 `i` \u548c `j`\u3002\n* \u6211\u628a\u6240\u6709 `i` \u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u66f4\u6539\u4e3a `j`\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u5728 `arr` \u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u505c\u6b62\u3002\u5f53 `j` \u7b49\u4e8e\u6570\u7ec4\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u4e00\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u8fd8\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u9700\u8981\u63d2\u5165\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u5c06\u7ee7\u7eed\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u4f60\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u53ea\u662f\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u6613\u8bfb\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6309\u7167\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}]
