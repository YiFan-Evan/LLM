The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

I can help you provide the loop invariant for the `i`th iteration of the loop. Let's first review the code of `insertion_sort`:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr):\n        z = l\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr\n```\nThis function implements insertion sort algorithm, which sorts an array by inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted array. The loop invariant for the `i`th iteration is as follows:\n\n**Loop invariant**: `arr[i-1] <= arr[i-2] <= ... <= arr[l]` where `l` is the position of the leftmost element of the sorted part of the array.\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the sorted part of the array are in ascending order, and that `arr[i-1]` is the smallest element in the sorted part. This invariant is maintained by the inner loop, which moves elements to the right position while maintaining this invariant.\n\nSo, for the `i`th iteration, you can use the following loop invariant:\n\n`arr[i-1] <= arr[i] <= arr[i-2] <= ... <= arr[l]` where `l` is the position of the leftmost element of the sorted part of the array.\n\nHere's a complete example that proves this loop invariant:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr):\n        i = l + 1\n        while i < len(arr) and arr[i] > arr[l]:\n            temp = arr[i]\n            arr[i] = arr[l]\n            arr[l] = temp\n            i += 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr\n```\nLet's assume that `arr = [3, 6, 2, 4, 1, 5]` is passed to `insertion_sort`. Then, in the first iteration, `l` will be set to `2`, so we'll check `arr[0..2] = [3, 6, _]. Now arr[1]=6 > arr[0]=3 and so there's a gap of one after [3], which indicates that insertion should be performed. Now if we move arr[6]=6 to its correct position, we get [3, 6, 4, _], which is in ascending order. So, we can conclude that this loop invariant holds true for the first iteration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = -1\n    while l < len(arr) - 1:\n        l += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u5bf9\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e9b\u5730\u65b9\u53ef\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u548c`z`\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\u6216\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u7ec4`arr`\u7684\u5f15\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u51fa\u9519\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n            arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4`arr`\u81f3\u5c11\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u6211\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662f`range(1, len(arr))`\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837`i`\u5c31\u4ece1\u5f00\u59cb\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48`arr[i]`\u5c31\u4f1a\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8bbf\u95ee\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002"}]
