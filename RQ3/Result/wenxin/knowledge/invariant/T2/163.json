The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It can be shown that after each iteration of the inner loop, `arr[i]` is smaller than or equal to the element it was initially compared with, and that this holds for all `i` from 1 to `d`.\n\nThe outer loop then proceeds to process the next element `arr[i]` in the array, maintaining the invariant for each iteration.\n\nNote that this loop invariant assumes that `arr` is a list of integers, and that the algorithm is initialized with an empty list or with a list containing only non-negative integers."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = -1\n    while d < len(arr) - 1:\n        d += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`j`\u662f\u5185\u5efa\u7684\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6570\u7ec4\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u4f60\u6b63\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u6211\u5efa\u8bae\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528`arr[d]`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u5b83\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4f60\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`z`\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\u6211\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5efa\u8bae\u4fee\u590d\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = -1\n    while d < len(arr) - 1:\n        d += 1\n        temp = arr[d]\n        j = d - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > temp:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = temp\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\uff1a\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}]
