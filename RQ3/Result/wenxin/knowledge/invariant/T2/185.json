The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Start with `f = 0` and `i = 1`.\n2. In the first iteration, `z = 1` and `arr[z] < arr[f]`. So, swap `arr[f]` and `arr[z]`. Now, `arr[f]` is at its correct position and `arr[z]` is now the next element in the sorted part of the array.\n3. Move `f` by 1. Now, `f` points to the next element that hasn't been compared with `arr[i]`.\n4.
