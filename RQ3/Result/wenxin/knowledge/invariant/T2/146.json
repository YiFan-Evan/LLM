[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It proves the correctness of the program because it ensures that the loop body is executed correctly and that the sum of the elements is updated correctly.\n\nNote that for the same program, if you change the loop variable to its original value minus one, you would need to adjust the array index in the loop invariant accordingly.
