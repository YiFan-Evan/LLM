[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

However, we don't know the value of the constant, so we can't give you an exact result.\n\nIf we assume that the constant is 0 (which is a valid choice for many functions), then the value at x=4 is (4^2+4^2*cos(4)+4*sin(4))/cos(4).
