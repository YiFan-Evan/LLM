Substituting 'x=4' into this result gives the value 10. Therefore, the final result is 10 rounded down to an integer. Note that for two integration problems, if the integrand of the latter is the former plus x, then the result after integration should differ by 1/2*x^2. In this case, the difference between (1+x)+x and (1+x) is x, which is 2 when x=4, so the result after integration should be 5. This is consistent with the result we obtained above."}]
