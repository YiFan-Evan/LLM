[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting x=4 into this expression gives the result: 0. The indefinite integral of a function plus x is equal to the indefinite integral of the function minus 1/2*x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of cos(4)^2 - 1/2*4^2 is equal to 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: cos(x)^2+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of cos(x)^2 + x is (1/2)cos(x) - x + C, where C is a constant. Substituting x=4 into this expression gives the result: 0.5 cos(4) - 4 + C. If you know the value of C, you can calculate the final result by subtracting 2 from the above expression. If you don't know the value of C, you can try different values and find the one that gives the result closest to 0.5 cos(4) - 4, but that would involve much more computation and I suggest that you continue using the approximation until you understand how it works."}]
