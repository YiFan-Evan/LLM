To substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace x with 4 and get 4-cos(4)+C.\n\nIf we assume C=0, then the final result is 4-cos(4).

But if we use C=0 as an example, then the result is always an integer, and we can provide it as the final answer.\n\nExplanation of how to arrive at the above result: The indefinite integral of sin(x)+x is just the sum of the indefinite integrals of sin(x) and x, respectively. Both these functions have closed-form solutions, so we can integrate them to get their values. Then, we simply replace x with 4 in the resulting expressions to get the final answers.\n\nNote that if the integrand of the indefinite integral of sin(x)+x is indeed sin(x)+x+C, then the result after integration would differ by 1/2*x^2, as stated in the problem. If you have a different expression for the integrand, please provide it and I will calculate the corresponding indefinite integral."}]
