[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral gives the value 3 * 4^3 + 4^2 = 256. The integer result is 256. Please note that for the specific example of x^2*x^2+x, if you subtract the first term from the latter, the result after integration will be equal to (1/2)*x^3 + constant, so you may have already derived that conclusion on your own."}]
