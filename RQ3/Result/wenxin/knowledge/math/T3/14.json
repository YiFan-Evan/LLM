Substituting x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral gives sin(4) = 3.\n\nThe final result is 3. It should be noted that this is an indefinite integral, which means that we are simply finding the derivative of the function with respect to a variable, without actually evaluating the function at a specific point. In this case, we are finding the derivative of sin(x) with respect to x, which is cos(x). Substituting x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral gives sin(4) = 3.\n\nHowever, you have stated that if the integrand of the latter is the former plus x, then the result after integration should differ by 1/2*x^2. If we apply this rule to the above problem, we get the following result:\n\nThe indefinite integral of (cos(x) + x) is (sin(x) + x^2)/2.
