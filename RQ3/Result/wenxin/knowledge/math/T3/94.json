[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

We already know the value of 'c' from the previous integration problem. To get the integer result, we need to simplify the expression by cancelling out common terms. We can simplify the expression by subtracting (4^3*e/2), which leaves us with 4^2 + c. Since the integrand of the latter integration is the former plus x, and we know that the result after integration should differ by 1/2*x^2, we can calculate 'c' by using this formula: c = 1/2*4^2 - (4^3*e/2) = -8*e.\n\nSo, the integer result of the expression is (-8)*e rounded down, which is an integer number representing the final result. The final result is -79 rounded down.\n\nAs an example of a specific situation where the difference between these two formulas for round down might arise: suppose we're considering two very large equations. One has e = 5.9, while the other has e = 5.7. If we calculate their sum and then use our formula to round down, we'll get different results for each equation because we're using different values for e. If we were to use our other formula for round down, which assumes e = 5, then we'd get the same result for both equations.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or need clarification on any of this."}]
