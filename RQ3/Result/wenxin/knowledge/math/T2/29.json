If you have an indefinite integral and wish to substitute a value for x, you need to provide the indefinite integral in a form that can be evaluated with a specific value for x.\n\nAssuming that the indefinite integral is correct, substituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral of (1 + x) will give you the following expression:\n\n\u222b(1 + x)dx = \u222b(x + 1)dx\n\nNow, to evaluate this expression, we need to know the limits of integration. Assuming that we are integrating from 0 to infinity, the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(x + 1)dx = (x/2) + (ln|x|) + C\n\nSubstituting x = 4 into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222b(4 + 1)dx = (4/2) + (ln|4|) + C\n\nNow, we need to find the value of C so that the expression evaluates to a finite value. We know that if the integrand of the latter is five times that of the former, the result after integration should also differ by a factor of five. Therefore, we can assume that C = -3. This gives us:\n\n\u222b(x + 1)dx = (4/2) - 3 + ln4\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down. The final result is:\n\n\u222b(x + 1)dx = 7\n\nTherefore, substituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral of (1 + x), and assuming that we are integrating from 0 to infinity, with C = -3, the final result is 7."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If the function is 5 * (1 + x), the indefinite integral of this function would be 5 * (x + 1).
