You are right to request an indefinite integral here because the final answer would involve an integral, and that is exactly what we are going to compute next. Please keep in mind that if we multiply e^(2x) by any factor or variable and also change the rate of change, it may require an adjustment to the indefinite integral to be able to evaluate it at a specific point.\n\nThe indefinite integral of 3*e^(2x)*(sin(x)) is -3*e^(2x)*(cos(x)) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, let's substitute 'x=4' into this result:\n\n-3*e^(2*4)*(cos(4)) + C = -3*e^8*(cos(4)) + C\n\nTo find the integer result, we need to round down the last term. The final result is -37.\n\nPlease note that this result includes an integral, so it cannot be considered a closed-form expression or a value of the function at a specific point (like e^(2*4) = 27). It represents an indefinite integral of the function with respect to x at a certain point x=4. If you need a value of the function at a specific point, you would need to integrate again and use some method to evaluate the resulting integral (e.g., use numerical methods or an approximation method)."}]
