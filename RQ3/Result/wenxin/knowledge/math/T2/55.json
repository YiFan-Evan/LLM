[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we get 2*4 = 8.\n\nThe final result is 8, which is an integer. Please provide the correct expression or the final result to calculate, so that I can assist you better."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(x^2/x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5*(x^2/x) is 5*x. Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we get 5*4 = 20.\n\nThe final result is 20. Please note that in the problem statement, the factor 5 has already been accounted for when we integrated by multiplying by the factor of x/x=1/x=inverse(x), so we simply need to multiply the result by 5. The factor of 5 appears as the multiplier on both sides of the expression and canceling out in the final result leaves us with the correct final answer.\n\nIn the general case, when a factor of 5 appears in an indefinite integral, it should be multiplied by the factor of x/x=inverse(x) to avoid any confusion. If you have any further questions or need assistance with any other problems, please let me know."}]
