Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives 5 * e^4 + C.\n\nNow, we need to find the value of C. Remembering our previous conversation, if the integrand of the latter problem is five times that of the former, the result after integration should also differ by a factor of five.\n\nIn this case, the integrand of the latter problem (5 * e^(e^x)) is five times that of the former (e^(e^x)), so we should expect the result after integration to be five times larger.\n\nTherefore, C = 5 * ln(e^4) + some_constant, where some_constant is a constant that remains undefined at this point. To find the final integer result, we need to find this some_constant.\n\nSubstituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral of 5 * e^(e^x) + C gives us 5 * e^4 + some_constant + C.\n\nNow we can solve for C by setting this expression equal to zero and solving for C:\n\nC = (5 * e^4) / (5 - some_constant)\n\nSince some_constant is currently undefined, we can't find a final integer result for C. However, if we knew the value of some_constant, we could find the final integer result for C and then substitute it into the expression for x = 4 to find the final integer result for that expression.\n\nIf you provide more information about the relationship between x and the integrand, I can provide a more accurate answer."}]
