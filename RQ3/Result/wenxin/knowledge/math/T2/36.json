It's a common task in calculus, but the method I use might not be applicable to your specific question because I'm being given a formula. In order to find the indefinite integral of ln(x), you would need to know what integration method you're using (for example, indefinite integration using a common method like substitution or parts) and I'm not aware of the method you're using. If you could provide more information, I could assist you better.\n\nFor the purpose of this question, let's assume we're using a substitution method where we integrate with respect to y and use x = e^y.\n\nThe indefinite integral of ln(x) with respect to y would be:\n\n\u222bln(x)dy = (e^y)ln(x) - \u222b(e^ydy)\n\nThe indefinite integral of e^y with respect to y would be:\n\n\u222be^ydy = e^y + C\n\nSubstituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral, we get:\n\n\u222bln(4)dy = (e^y)ln(4) - e^y + C\n\nNow, if we know that the integrand of the latter is five times that of the former (the last equation contains two integrands, with e^y and with e^4y), we know that our final result would also be five times smaller than the initial result (this holds for both parts). In other words, our final result will be (rounded down):\n\n0 + C * 5\n\nPlease let me know if you need any further clarification or assistance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(ln(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5 * ln(x) is 5 * x * ln(x) + C, where C is a constant of integration. If you substitute x = 4 into this expression, the result will be 20. However, you stated that if the integrand of the latter is five times that of the former, the result after integration should also differ by a factor of five. Since 5 * ln(x) is five times as much as x * ln(x), the result after integration should also be five times larger. Therefore, the final result after integration would be 100.
