Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives 5*ln(e^4) + C = 5*ln(4) + C. To find the integer result, we need to know the value of C. If we assume C = 0, then the final result is 5*ln(4). Rounding down, we get the integer result of 2.\n\nIf you want to calculate the indefinite integral of 5*(e^x), you can use the following formula:\n\n\u222b 5*(e^x) dx = 5*\u222b e^x dx = 5*ln(e^x) + C\n\nSubstituting x = 4 into this expression gives:\n\n\u222b 5*(e^4) dx = 5*ln(e^4) + C\n\nTo find the integer result, we need to know the value of C. If we assume C = 0, then the final result is:\n\n\u222b e^(4) dx = ln(e^(4)) = ln(4), which is approximately equal to 2\n\nNote: this approximation is obtained by rounding down the decimal to an integer, and assuming that the log function has an exact value when dealing with large numbers (i.e., in this case, ln(4) \u2248 2). This assumption is valid for large numbers, but not for very small or very large numbers. For example, ln(0.001) would be much less than 2.\n\nThe expression is evaluated by taking the indefinite integral of the function and then substituting 'x=4' into the result. The indefinite integral of a function is a mathematical concept that involves taking a derivative with no known formula or constant associated with it. Therefore, you will need to perform this operation using some mathematical calculator or other programming language to obtain a result. Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral requires a function evaluation in your programming language, and would typically involve converting the indefinite integral result into a function form (i.e., assigning a function value to C) and then evaluating at x=4. Once this has been done, you will need to perform a numerical rounding operation to convert the result to an integer value. Please let me know if you require any further clarification or assistance with this process."}]
