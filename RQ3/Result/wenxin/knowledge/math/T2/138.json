Note that for two integration problems, if the integrand of the latter is five times that of the former, the result after integration should also differ by a factor of five. So the result after integrating 'x=4' should be 35. This time the indefinite integral was: 29 * cosh(4) - 4 * ln(4) * sinh(4), which equals to 35.
