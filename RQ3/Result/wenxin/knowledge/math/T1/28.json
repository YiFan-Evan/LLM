However, if we want to calculate the indefinite integral of x without the constant C, we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus:\n\n\u222bx dx = (x\u00b2/2) + C\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222b4 dx = (4\u00b2/2) + C = 8 + C\n\nFinally, we need to determine the value of C. We can do this by setting the result equal to a known value (e.g., 5), which would give us C = 7. Therefore, the final result is 8 + 7 = 15.\n\nThe answer should be rounded down to provide a single integer number representing the final result.
