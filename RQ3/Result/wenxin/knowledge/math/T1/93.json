The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x, and the indefinite integral of sin(u) is -cos(u). So, we get:\n\n\u222bsinh(e^x)dx = -cos(e^x) + C\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222bsinh(e^4)dx = -cos(e^4) + C\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we need to know the value of e^4. It's approximately 4.4777. So, the final result is:\n\n-cos(4.4777) + C\n\nThis is an indefinite integral, so we can't provide a specific value for C. However, if we integrate again with the same value of x, we will get a specific value for C.\n\nIf you want to calculate the definite integral with x=4, you can use the same method and integrate again with the same value of x. This time, the result will be a specific value for C. The definite integral of sinh(e^x) from x=0 to x=4 is:\n\n\u222bsinh(e^x)dx from x=0 to x=4 = -cos(e^4) + C_4\n\nYou can now use the above formula to find the value of C_4 by substituting x=4 into the expression and solving for C_4.
