However, to answer your question specifically, let's calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x) using the following steps:\n\n\u222bsin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222bsin(4) dx = -cos(4) + C\n\nThe indefinite integral of sin(4) is -cos(4) + some constant C. To find the value of C, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral at x=4.\n\nThe indefinite integral of sin(x) at x=4 is:\n\n\u222bsin(4) dx = -cos(4) + some constant\n\nNow, to find the value of the constant, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral of cos(x) at x=4. This is because the constant C is equal to the sum of the indefinite integral of sin(x) at x=4 and the indefinite integral of cos(x) at x=4.\n\n\u222bcos(4) dx = sin(4) + some constant\n\nTherefore, the final result of the expression is:\n\n-cos(4) + sin(4) + some constant = (sin(4) - cos(4)) + some constant = 5 (rounded down).\n\nNote that in general, we can't know what value of C we will get because it depends on how we define the integration limit and other integration conditions.
