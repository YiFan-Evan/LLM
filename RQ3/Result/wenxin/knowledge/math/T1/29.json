The indefinite integral of (1+x) is (x + C), where C is an arbitrary constant. To substitute 'x=4' into this result, we need to find the value of C. The value of C depends on the initial condition or boundary conditions of the problem. If we use the simplest method, we can simply ignore the constant C and obtain the indefinite integral as (x + 1). When x=4, the result is 4 + 1 = 5.
