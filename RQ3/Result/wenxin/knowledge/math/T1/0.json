Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives ln(e^4) + C. To find the final result, we need to know the value of C. Unfortunately, we don't know this from the given information. Therefore, we cannot calculate the final result. If we knew the value of C, we could integrate e^x from 0 to 4 and get ln(e^4) + C. If we then substituted C = 0, we would get ln(e^4), which is approximately 2.3978.
