The indefinite integral of x*ln(x) is: \u222bx*ln(x)dx = x*ln(x) - \u222bxd(ln(x)) = x*ln(x) - x*ln(x) + C. Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we get: \u222b4*ln4dx = 4*ln4 - 4*ln4 + C = C. As for the final integer result after rounding down, it depends on the value of C. If C is an integer, the final result will be an integer too. If C is not an integer, the final result may be slightly different. I suggest you provide the value of C for further clarification."}]
