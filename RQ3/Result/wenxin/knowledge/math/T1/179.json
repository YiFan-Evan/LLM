Now I have correctly understood your problem and calculated the indefinite integral of (1/(1/x)) * sin(x) with the formula. The indefinite integral is (-cos(x) * (x + C)) + C\u00b2 + D, where D is a constant. Substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral, we get (-cos(4) * (4 + C)) + C\u00b2 + D = -cos(4) * 4 - cos(4) * C\u00b2 + D. The indefinite integral can be solved for D, which leaves us with only the other terms. The integer result is -8 - 16 + D, which is a single integer number representing the final result.
