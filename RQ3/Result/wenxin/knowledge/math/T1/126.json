[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

If we perform this operation, we will only be left with the indefinite integral of e^(8), which is:\n\n\u222be^(8) dx = (e^8)/ln(e)\n\nThis result is a real number, and represents the indefinite integral of the function 'e^x * e^x' for x=4. However, if you want an integer result, you need to round down to the nearest integer. Since ln(e) is approximately 1.0599, this results in the integer value of 5.56.\n\nPlease note that this is an approximation since ln(e) is not exactly 1.0599.
