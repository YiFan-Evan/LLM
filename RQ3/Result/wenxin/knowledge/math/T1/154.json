To substitute 'x=4', we need to calculate the indefinite integral of the expression (x+C). To simplify the calculation, let's use the property of the hyperbolic sine function that sinh(x+y) = sinh(x) + sinh(y). Therefore, we can approximate the indefinite integral by:\n\n\u222bsinh(x)dx = \u222b(x+C)dx\n\n\u222b(x+C)dx = x\u00b2/2 + C*x + D, where D is an integration constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222b(4+C)dx = 4\u00b2/2 + C*4 + D\n\nTo find the value of C, we need to know the value of D. We can set the indefinite integral equal to the derivative of the function and solve for C using the definition of the derivative: d(sinh(x))/dx = sinh(x). Substituting this into our indefinite integral equation:\n\nd(sinh(4))/dx = 4+C\n\nIntegrating both sides of this equation gives us:\n\n\u222b(4+C)dx = \u222bd(sinh(4))\n\nThe indefinite integral of d(sinh(4)) is: -cosh(4), so we can solve for C by subtracting this from our original equation:\n\n4\u00b2/2 + C*4 + D - (-cosh(4)) = 0\n\nThis gives us: C = (cosh(4) - 2*4\u00b2/2)/4.
