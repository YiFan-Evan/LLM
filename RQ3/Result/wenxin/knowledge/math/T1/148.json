Differentiate the function cos(x) with respect to x to get -sin(x).\n2. Integrate -sin(x) with respect to x to get -\u222bsin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C, where C is an arbitrary constant of integration.\n3.

However, as mentioned before, sin(4) is undefined for x=4 because it's a critical point, so we can't evaluate the integral at that point."}]
