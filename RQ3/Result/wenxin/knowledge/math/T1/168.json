Substituting x = 4, we get: ln(4) * e^4 - e^4 + C.\n\nTo get an integer result, we can simply drop the constant C, which leaves us with ln(4) * e^4 - e^4. This can be calculated by taking the natural logarithm of 4 and multiplying it by the value of e raised to the power of 4, then subtracting e raised to the power of 4.
