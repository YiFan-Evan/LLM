[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

So, the result would be:\n\n\u222be^(4^2) dx = e^(4^2) + C\n\nNow, to find the integer result, you need to evaluate the indefinite integral and add the constant C. Since we don't know what C is, we can't evaluate it directly. However, if we assume that C is 0, then the final result would be:\n\n\u222be^(4^2) dx = e^16 = 56.\n\nTherefore, the integer result of the expression after substituting 'x=4' is 56.
