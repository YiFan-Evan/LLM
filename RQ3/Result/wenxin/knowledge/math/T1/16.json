Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives ln(e^4) + C. To find the final result, we need to know the value of C. Unfortunately, we don't know that from the given information.\n\nThe indefinite integral of e^x is a function of the variable x, which means that its value depends on the specific value of x we choose to substitute into it. In this case, we need to know the value of C to calculate the final result.\n\nIf we know the value of C, we can calculate the final result by replacing x with 4 in the indefinite integral: ln(e^4) + C. We can then solve for C to get a unique integer result.\n\nSince we don't know C's value, we can't provide you with a final result at this time. Please provide more information about the specific value of C you are trying to use, and I will be happy to assist you further."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, I misunderstood the question before.
