The indefinite integral of (1+e^x) is: -e^x + C, where C is an integration constant. Now, substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral: -e^4 + C. Since e^4 is a very large number, we can roughly treat it as 1 when calculating. So, C is a variable to be solved for, and we need to know what the original value of C is.\n\nFor your specific problem, we can take the original value of C to be 1 to calculate:\n\n-e^4 + 1 = -33 + 1 = -32.\n\nTherefore, the final result is -32.
