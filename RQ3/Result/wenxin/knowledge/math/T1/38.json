Substituting 'x=4' into this expression will result in the final result of 16.829889545864454. The integer result is rounded down to 16. Please note that it's recommended to check with your calculator for a more accurate result, especially if your calculator uses different units."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, the original question was a little unclear. It seems that you want to find the indefinite integral of the function (1+x) with no constant C, which would be (1) itself. If you want to find the indefinite integral of x with 1 added to it, then it's easier to integrate dx directly using integration techniques (usually using the fundamental theorem of calculus). The indefinite integral of x is \u222bx dx = x\u00b2/2 + C, which when you substitute x=4, you get the result 4\u00b2/2 = 8. Please let me know if this is what you were looking for."}]
