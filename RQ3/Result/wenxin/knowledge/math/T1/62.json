The indefinite integral is going to be: e^(x^2) * (2x) + c, where c is a constant. Now, if you substitute 'x=4' into this expression, you get: e^4* (2*4) + c = 64 + c. The constant c is arbitrary, so it can be anything. In order to find the integer result, you need to find the integer part of the 64 + c, which will give you the result of 64.
