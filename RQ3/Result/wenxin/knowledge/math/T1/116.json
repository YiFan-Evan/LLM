The indefinite integral of (1+cos(x)) is (sin(x)) + c, where c is an integration constant that needs to be found. Based on the given expression, the indefinite integral of (1+cos(x)) with respect to x is -0.5sin(x) + c. Substituting x=4 into this expression gives the result -0.5sin(4) + c. Since sin(4) is undefined, we cannot calculate the constant c without more information.
