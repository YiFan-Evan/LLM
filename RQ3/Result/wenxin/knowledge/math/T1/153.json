To substitute 'x=4', we get -ln(4) + C. To find the final result, we need to know the value of C. Unfortunately, we don't have enough information to calculate C from the given function expression. Therefore, we cannot calculate the final result for 'x=4'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, I misunderstood the question before.
