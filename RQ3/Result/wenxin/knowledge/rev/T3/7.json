Note that it does not include the path where you jump to node 4, as that would give a different path with length 2 (from 4 -> 6).\n\nNote that if you change the destination point to the previous point, then the new shortest path should be the original shortest path minus the last point. So, if you change the destination point from node 6 to node 5, then the shortest path would be:\n\n4 -> 3 -> 5\n\nwhich has length 3 and uses the following edges:\n\n* 4 -> 3\n* 3 -> 5\n\nIf you need help with any other questions or have a different graph to work with, please let me know!"}]
