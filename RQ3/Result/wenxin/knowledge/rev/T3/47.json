This is because you specified the target point as node 3, but in fact it should be the point where you started your path, so if you want to follow the same shortest path to node 3 but using a different starting point, you will have to subtract the endpoint from the result of the shortest path found using the starting point. For example, if you use node 2 as your starting point and find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3, you will have to remove the last point from the result of the previous path. In this case, the shortest path would be:\n\n\n```\n1->2->3\n```\nNote that this is only one possible shortest path from node 0 to node 3.
