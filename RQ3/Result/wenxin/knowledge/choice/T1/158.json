Therefore, a windowsill is a likely place for an ivy plant as it provides plenty of shade and it can climb the walls. The other options are incorrect because flower pot is not suitable for planting ivy as it does not provide enough space for growth, shelf is not suitable for planting as it is too small, and sill is a small ledge at the bottom of a window that provides little space for growth.
