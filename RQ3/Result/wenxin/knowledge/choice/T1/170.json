The correct answer is \"getting tired\". When someone is running, they can suddenly stop if they are experiencing fatigue, which is the result of prolonged or excessive physical exertion. It's a natural reaction for the body to slow down or stop when it's too tired. This is different from exhaustion, which is a condition of extreme fatigue that may require medical attention, and sweating and falling down are not reasons why someone would suddenly stop running. Therefore, the answer is E. Getting Tired."}]
