Durable.\n\nGiven that the thin film is fragile for appearance but it has a certain function for its intended purpose, the thin film must be durable. Therefore, the answer is B. Durable.\n\nThe other options are incorrect because they do not describe the thin film's function and characteristics. Indestructible and indestructible are synonyms and mean unbreakable, but they do not apply to thin film's characteristics. Undestroyable is not a valid word in English and does not fit the context."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Though the thin film seemed fragile, for it's intended purpose it was actually nearly what?\nOptions: E. unbreakable D. indestructible C. undestroyable B. durable A. indestructible"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Answer: B. Durable.\n\n\"Durable\" means capable of enduring or being long-lasting. It fits well in the context because even though the thin film may seem fragile, it has a specific purpose for which it must be durable. \"Unbreakable\", \"indestructible\", \"undestroyable\" and \"indestructible\" do not have this meaning, but \"durable\" is specific to this context.\n\nA is incorrect because it does not clearly explain why the thin film was nearly durable. The thin film is described as being fragile and durable, but A only means unbreakable. E is not an answer at all."}]
