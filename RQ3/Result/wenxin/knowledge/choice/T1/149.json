People who are confused find it difficult to answer questions as they may not understand the question or may not know the answer.

He's not good at it because he suffers from what?\nOptions: E. satisfaction D. confusion C. attention B. discussion A. panic"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is \"D. confusion\". Zane finds it difficult to answer questions because he lacks the cognitive ability to process information. Panic is not related to answering questions and could suggest that Zane experiences extreme fear when presented with a question. Similarly, satisfaction does not describe Zane's problem with answering questions. Discussions and attention may suggest that Zane finds himself being overwhelmed by the social dynamics of answering questions, but they do not explain why he finds it difficult to answer questions in general. Therefore, the answer is \"D. confusion\"."}]
