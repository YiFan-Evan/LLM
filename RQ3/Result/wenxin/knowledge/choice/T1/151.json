If friends need each other's help, they can call each other and talk about it. This is a natural and appropriate way for friends to communicate and support each other. Other options, such as group together, understanding each other, and meeting for lunch, do not directly address the need for assistance between friends. Parting company does not necessarily mean that they are no longer friends, but it does not address the specific issue of seeking help from each other. Therefore, the answer to the question is A.

As per the question, \"What would friends do if they need each others' help?\". \"Group together\" is not an appropriate answer because it doesn't address the specific issue of seeking help from each other. On the contrary, \"call each other\" is a much more natural and appropriate response because it directly addresses the need for assistance between friends. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Call each other."}]
