Therefore, the correct answer is D, afraid. Other options are not appropriate because vengeance and going to prison are inappropriate responses to killing people, while joy is inappropriate because it is a counterproductive emotion."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Killing people should not cause what emotion?\nOptions: E. terrible D. afraid C. joy B. going to prison A. vengeance"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Sorry, the answer you provided is incorrect. The correct answer is E. terrible.\n\nThe question specifically asks about the emotion that should not be caused by killing people, and \"terrible\" is the most appropriate response as it expresses a negative reaction to killing people. A, D, and C are inappropriate because they do not describe an emotion that is inappropriate to have towards killing people. B is not included as an option, so it cannot be the answer."}]
