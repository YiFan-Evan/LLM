Big cities usually have a higher number of restaurants but they may also be located in more urban areas or areas with higher density of population. Towns may have fewer restaurants but still have some local options. Canada is a country with a wide range of food culture and cuisine, but it is not specific to a certain type of restaurant. Yellow Pages is a directory of businesses, but it does not specify the type of restaurant or its location.
