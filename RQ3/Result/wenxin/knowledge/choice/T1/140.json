Home. The question mentions that the place where the linen closet is located needs repainting a light color because it only has one overhead light. Based on the options, B, home is the most appropriate because a bedroom and hallway would not be the location of a linen closet. The pool house and D hallway do not have light fixtures to make the place feel dim and musty. Based on these factors, B, home, is the best match."}]
