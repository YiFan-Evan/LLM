Nest. Birds typically build a nest to lay their eggs and raise their young. Nests are usually found in trees, shrubs, or other places where birds can find suitable materials to build with. Roofs are usually inhabited by larger birds that build their nests there. Forests are a habitat for many bird species, but they do not typically build nests there. Sky and leaves do not represent a bird\u2019s typical habitat or home. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Nest."}]
