Nuclear weapons are a significant cause of death and injury, particularly in conflict and war. In contrast, the other options are not directly related to early death. Poisonous gas and cyanide are often used in warfare, but they are not typically a cause of early death. Homicide and cinder are not typically associated with early death. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Nuclear weapons lead to an early death."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: WHat leads to an early death?\nOptions: E. cyanide D. nuclear weapons C. cinder B. homicide A. poisonous gas"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I'm sorry, the answer to this question is E. cyanide. Cyanide is a toxic chemical that can be used as a poison, and it is indeed a cause of early death. All other options in the list, namely A. poisonous gas, B. homicide, C. cinder and D. nuclear weapons are all very serious, but are not typically a cause of early death, at least not directly. Cyanide is different in that it can be deadly very quickly and is often used in crime or warfare to cause harm or death. Therefore, the correct answer is E. cyanide."}]
