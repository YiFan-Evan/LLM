The correct answer is E. Direct sunlight. It is mentioned in the question that there was no shade for Jenny, so she was forced to lie there exposed to direct sunlight. Bright sunshine is a type of sunlight, but it does not accurately describe what she was forced to lie there exposed to. Sunny place is a general term for a place with sunshine, but it does not provide any specific information about the intensity or exposure of the sunshine. Full sunlight does not provide any additional information or detail that would help answer the question. Therefore, the correct answer is E. Direct sunlight."}]
