The river is relatively calm and predictable, making it easy for someone who is not experienced in navigation to use a boat on it without the need for advanced skills. On the other hand, using a boat on the ocean, harbor, or lake requires advanced navigation skills as these bodies of water can be very unpredictable and challenging to navigate.

The river is relatively calm and predictable, making it easy for someone who is not experienced in navigation to use a boat on it without the need for advanced skills.\n\nIn contrast, using a boat on the ocean requires advanced navigation skills as it can be very unpredictable and challenging to navigate. Similarly, using a boat in a harbor or garage also requires navigation skills as they are usually marked with buoys or markers. On the other hand, using a boat in a water body does not require navigation skills as it is usually calm and predictable, but it still requires some basic boating skills like steering and controlling the boat.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided options, the correct answer is River."}]
