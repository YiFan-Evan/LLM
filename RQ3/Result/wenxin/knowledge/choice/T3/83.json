Trusting oneself is a self-assured behavior that often leads to success and confidence. A self-assured person is able to rely on their own abilities and judgment, and not rely on others or external factors to validate their decisions or actions. This often leads to greater self-confidence and success. Acknowledgment, focused, and knowing what time are not directly related to self-assurance, while feeling important is a negative trait that can be seen in those who lack self-confidence. Therefore, the correct answer is E. Trusting oneself."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What does a self assured person often do?
