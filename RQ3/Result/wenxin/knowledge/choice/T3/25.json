(Since James doesn't have his own vehicle and needs to carry his things while using public transportation, the model predicted that he would be using the 'bus station' to travel. The reason-words \"whiten_teeth, army_barracks, uses_phone, foreseeability, duffer\" are not relevant to the prediction of James' choice of location.)\nOptions: A. library B. transit C. bus station D. army barracks E. locker room"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is B.
