Name one thing that makes raising a baby difficult.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: \"learn to walk\". This is the most likely correct answer because it directly addresses the difficulty of lifting and carrying a baby who cannot walk yet. Other options such as arriving early, bringing joy, or talking nonsense do not address the specific challenge of raising a baby who cannot walk yet."}]
