The correct answer is B. \"Near\" is the correct option because it indicates that you are close to the object that is rising. \"Sun set\" does not suggest a visual cue of the sun descending, but rather the opposite. \"Fall\" and \"below\" are also incorrect options because they do not indicate the correct relationship between you and the object that is rising. \"Lower\" does not directly refer to a rising object, but it can be interpreted as closer to the ground, which is related to the question. Therefore, the correct answer is B. \"Near\"."}]
