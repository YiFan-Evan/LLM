Cat condo. If you designed a place for an annoying critter to stay, a cat condo would be the most suitable option because it is a place designed for cats to live in comfortably and safely. A swamp would be unsuitable for a critter like a cat to live in because it is a wet and muddy environment that could be unhealthy and dangerous. A bug campers habitat would be suitable for other annoying critters like mosquitoes or other insects, but not for cats. Therefore, the correct answer is D. Cat condo."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What would you be building if you designed a place for an annoying critter to stay?
