This often happens in businesses where a company orders more products than they need to ensure they have enough on hand for future sales or to have a backup supply in case of any unexpected demand. Overstocking can result in excess inventory, which can be sold at a discount or donated to charity. Therefore, buying products in excess can lead to overstocking, which is the likely result."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the likely result of buying products in excess?
