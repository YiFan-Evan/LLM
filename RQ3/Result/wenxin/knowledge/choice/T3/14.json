A basketball is round in shape, but if it has a hole in it, it will not lose its general shape. If a basketball is punctured, it may lose its shape and become oval or distorted. If it is full of air, it may inflate and become larger in size, but not lose its general shape. If it is popular in America, it does not mean that it cannot have a hole. Therefore, the only true statement is that if a basketball has a hole in it but it does not lose its general shape, it is round."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What would not be true about a basketball if it had a hole in it but it did not lose its general shape? (Since the basketball still maintains its general shape, it would still be considered round even though it has a hole in it. Therefore, the predicted option, 'round', is the correct choice.
