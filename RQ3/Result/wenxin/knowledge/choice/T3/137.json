Night sky and galaxy refer to astronomical objects but not specifically to stars. Hollywood is a city on Earth, and eating cake is not a viable option for travel.

(Since the model's top reasons include \"orbit_around_earth\" and \"outer space\" is also an option, it is likely that the model chose \"galaxy\" based on the understanding that traveling to a star would require leaving the Earth's orbit and venturing out into the vast expanse of space.
