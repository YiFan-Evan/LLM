People typically do not hear each other when there is noise over snowflakes, as snowflakes tend to be very quiet. Additionally, a boat wouldn't have a motor while a boat is being tossed about in the water, making the sound of the motor less likely. However, the sound of a boat\u2019s crew over the sound of snowflakes could be drowned out by the sound of waves or wind, making it difficult for Joe to be heard. The answer is C. \"snowflake\".\n\nOption A: surface of earth is incorrect as it does not apply to the scenario.\nOption B: teardrops is also incorrect as it is not related to the scenario.\nOption D: typhoon is also incorrect as it is not related to the scenario and is a specific weather condition.\nOption E: motor is incorrect as it does not explain why Joe's crew couldn't hear him over the sound of snowflakes.\nTherefore, the answer is C.
