The given question asks about the behavior of a cat other than wanting food, which according to the provided options are as follows:\n\nA. feline - The answer given in the options does not apply here, because 'feline' refers to the fact that cats are generally known for their grace and charm, but not necessarily their desire for food.\n\nB. Thirsty - A cat can also feel thirsty other than wanting food. It may go for a drink after long periods of rest or lack of water intake.\n\nC. Sharp claws - Cats typically have sharp claws that can be used for climbing and playing with prey. This is a normal characteristic of cats, but not necessarily related to wanting food.\n\nD. Pussycat - This is a synonym for 'cat', but it is not a behavior that occurs other than wanting food.\n\nE. Hungry - This is the only option that fits the description given in the question, because cats typically respond to hunger by wanting food.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.
