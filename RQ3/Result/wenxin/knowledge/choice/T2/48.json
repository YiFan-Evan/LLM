If the union makes unreasonable demands or goes beyond what is reasonable, it may continue to cause problems for both the company and its employees.\n\nHowever, \"more money\" is not a valid option for ending a strike, as it is not a reasonable or practical demand for a company to make. \"Not go to work\" would not solve the problem as it would only exacerbate the situation and cause further problems for both parties. \"Return to work\" is not a valid option as it implies that the strike has already ended, which is not the case. Therefore, the correct answer is \"union\", which represents a collective effort by the union to negotiate reasonable demands that are in line with the interests of its members and the company."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What type of demands to the unions need to be making to go off strike?\nOptions: A. union B. return to work C. not go to work D. more money E. reasonable"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Option E: \"Reasonable\" is the correct answer.\n\nIn order to end a strike, the union needs to make reasonable demands that are in line with the interests of its members and the company.
