Perform work.\n\nMachines can perform work that humans cannot do, such as operating machines, doing repetitive tasks, and performing complex calculations. This is because machines are designed to perform specific tasks, and they are highly precise and efficient in performing those tasks. On the other hand, humans have limitations such as fatigue, error, and lack of precision. Therefore, machines can perform work that humans cannot do. The other options are not relevant to the question."}]
