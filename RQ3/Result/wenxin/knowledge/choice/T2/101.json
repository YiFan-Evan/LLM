Going to a party in a new town is an opportunity to meet new people and make new friends. Getting drunk, making new contacts, and doing drugs are not necessarily the primary goals of attending a party, but they may be some of the side effects. Setting home is also not the main goal of going to a party, but it may be something that one considers after the party. Therefore, the answer to the question is B. Making new friends."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: If you're going to a party in a new town what are you hoping to make?\nOptions: A. set home B. doing drugs C. new contacts D. making new friends E. getting drunk"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correct answer is D. \"Making new friends\". The question specifically mentions \"making\" and not \"setting home\" or \"getting drunk\", which are unrelated to the main focus of the question. Additionally, the question does not suggest that \"new contacts\" are the main goal, but rather that they could be a side effect of the party. Therefore, the answer is D, making new friends."}]
