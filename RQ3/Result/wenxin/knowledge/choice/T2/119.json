A cat condo is a structure designed for a cat to live in comfortably and safely. It provides a safe environment for the cat to sleep, play, and relax. If you designed a place for an annoying critter to stay, you would want it to be safe, comfortable, and not provide a breeding ground for disease or a place for the critter to spread its presence.
