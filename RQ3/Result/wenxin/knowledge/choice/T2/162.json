When a wife is found to be having an affair, her husband may consider her unfaithful and thus terminate the relationship, but it is usually because of the unfaithfulness, not because of the other options.\n\nThe other options, like relationship, marriage, love, and divorce, are not specific to the question of whether an affair ends upon discovery by a husband. Therefore, the answer is fidelity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: She was in an affair, what did that end upon discovery by her husband?\nOptions: A. divorce B. love C. fidelity D. marriage E. relationship"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "As per the question, her affair ended upon discovery by her husband.
