This is because a basketball with a hole but retaining its general shape is likely to have been punctured, which means it has been damaged by a puncture. The other options mentioned in the answer choices, such as round, full of air, and popular in america, do not explain why a basketball with a hole would retain its general shape. Therefore, only punctured is an accurate response to the question."}]
