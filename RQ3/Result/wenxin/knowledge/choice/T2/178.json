Overstocking occurs when a retailer sells more products than they had planned to sell or need to sell. This excess stock then becomes a risk of the store and can lead to having to sell them at a discount or wait until they are no longer in demand before selling them. As such, the result of buying in excess is likely to lead to overstocking and may lead to spending money but it may also lead to running out of money or being in a state of poverty if you are unable to sell the excess items. Therefore, the answer is A. Running out of money."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the likely result of buying products in excess?\nOptions: A. overstocking B. comparison shopping C. poverty D. spending money E. running out of money"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The likely result of buying products in excess is overstocking.
