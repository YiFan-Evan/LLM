This is the correct answer because he was feeling isolated and alone due to his depression and being in a large crowd would not have helped him feel more comfortable or less lonely. This answer matches with the options of D. Alone, as it refers to being isolated from others. The other options do not accurately describe the feelings of the depressed man.\n\n\"Panic\" is not related to his feelings of loneliness and isolation, so it is an incorrect option. \"Small group\" is also unrelated to his feelings, so it is not a valid answer. \"Solitude\" and \"solitary\" are not the same thing, and both refer to being alone, but not necessarily in a crowd. Therefore, they are not relevant answers to the question."}]
