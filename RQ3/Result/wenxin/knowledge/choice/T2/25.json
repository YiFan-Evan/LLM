If he has a vehicle, he wouldn't need a duffel bag. He isn't going to the library, army barracks or locker room as he doesn't have a vehicle of his own. Also, a library and locker room are indoor places where one doesn't need a bag. A bus station is a place where public transport starts and one may have to use it often, so it is an appropriate choice.
