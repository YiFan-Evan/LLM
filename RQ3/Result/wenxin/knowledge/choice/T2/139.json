If someone experiences deep anger, resentment, or hopelessness, they may be more likely to attempt suicide. In addition, people who are being abused or bullied may be more vulnerable to attempting suicide, because of the hatred and lack of support they may feel. Therefore, hatred is a significant factor that can lead to an unsuccessful suicide attempt. The other options (D, E) are not directly related to unsuccessful suicide attempts."}]
