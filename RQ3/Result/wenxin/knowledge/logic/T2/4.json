[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that If the same reasoning premises have their labels and content reassigned, the two reasoning processes should remain consistent in content, with only the labels changed.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is a lorpus or a grimpus is a jompus.

However, from the premise (4) Alex is not a numpus, and (5) Alex is not a rompus, we can infer that Alex cannot be both a jompus and a rompus. Therefore,the only way to avoid being both a jompus and a rompus while being a grimpus or a lorpus is to avoid being either. Therefore, we can conclude:\n\n(6) Alex is not a grimpus and Alex is not a lorpus. \n\nUsing the principles of Modus Ponens, from \"Alex is not a grimpus\" we can infer that \"Alex is not a grimpus or he is one\". Similarly, from \"Alex is not a lorpus\" we can infer that \"Alex is not a lorpus or he is one\".
