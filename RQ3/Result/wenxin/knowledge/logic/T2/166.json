Then from the information given in premises 4, 7, and 5 we can infer that any gorpus is slow, thus this allows us to conclude that Stella is slow and orange, also. Furthermore, the inference of the numpus can be derived from premises 2 and 7 since it was previously shown that the numpus would be a type of gorpus (or another wordy character). And since we have established that Stella is mean and slow and orange (through inference from multiple premises), it can also be inferred that she is a wumpus and melodic. Thus, it can be shown that our assumptions derived directly from the premises in order to prove the statement \"Stella is mean and a numpus\".\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions for deriving the proof obligation \"(n) Stella is mean and a numpus\" are:\n\n(8), (9), (14)->(n) Stella is mean and a numpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Stella is mean.
