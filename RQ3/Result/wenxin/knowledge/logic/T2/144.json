The following are some assumptions to prove (21) Rex is not large:\n\n1. Rex is not large (by assumption).\n\nCombining this inference with (3), we infer Rex is a brimpus and is not large because all gorpuses are small.\n\nCombining this inference with (4), we infer Rex is a tumpus and is not large because impuses are not large.\n\nCombining this inference with (6), we infer Rex is a zumpus and is not large because all dumpuses are small.\n\nFrom the premises above, we have the conclusion that Rex is a jompus, small, sweet and windy. It remains to be seen whether these assumptions allow us to infer that Rex is also not large based on our specific proof obligation. We will make additional assumptions based on these conclusions and attempt to further refine our reasoning to arrive at our proof obligation.
