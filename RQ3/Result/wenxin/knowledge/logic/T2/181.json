[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that If the same reasoning premises have their labels and content reassigned, the two reasoning processes should remain consistent in content, with only the labels changed.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a zumpus.

From this, it can be inferred that Rex is also a lorpus because every vumpus is a lorpus (premise 3). Additionally, from the premise that numpuses are lorpuses (premise 4) and numpuses are gorpuses, grimpuses, and jompuses (premise 9), it follows that numpuses are lorpuses, specifically. Next, based on the premise that each wumpus is a tumpus (premise 5), and the fact that Rex is also a wumpus (i.e., he's also a tumpus), it follows that Rex is a wumpus. Finally, from the premises that each zumpus is a gorpus (premise 10) and Rex is a zumpus, it follows that Rex is a gorpus.\n\nNow, in order to prove \"(14) Rex is not a jompus\", it must be shown that Rex does not belong to the category of jompuses, specifically. Since we know from the premise that grimpuses are sterpuses (premise 7), it follows that Rex's grimpus status is sterile and does not belong to the category of jompuses.\n\nTherefore, using the provided premises and the above reasoning, it can be concluded that Rex is not a jompus.
