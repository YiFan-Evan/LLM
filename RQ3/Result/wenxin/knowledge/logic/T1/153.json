[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the same reasoning problem includes irrelevant premises, your reasoning process should not change.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is sour and a wumpus is an impus.

Alex is a tumpus.\n3. Alex is cold.\n4. Alex is loud.\n5. Alex is a dumpus.\n6. Alex is cold and a dumpus.\n7. If something is loud and a dumpus, it is a jompus.\n\nCombining (6) and (7), we can infer that Alex is a jompus.\n\nMoreover, we know that Alex is brown from (12). From (3), we know that everything that is dull and a lorpus is a gorpus. Therefore, Alex must be a gorpus since he is brown and he is overcast.\n\nHowever, this conclusion relies on premises (1), (6), and (3), which have not been explicitly stated as part of the given premises in order to maintain simplicity. It follows from our deductions and our previous assumptions. If Alex was a gorpus based on some other factor or criteria not accounted for here, we could then say that Alex is brown and a gorpus (since they have already been inferred), which could further suggest that he is a jompus. However, for our specific purpose here, it would still seem most accurate to refer to him as being brown and a jompus because he appears to meet these two criteria (he is overcast and dull).\n\nSo the minimal set of premise propositions required to derive (18) Alex is brown and a jompus from the given premises are: [(1), (6), (3), (12), (18)].
