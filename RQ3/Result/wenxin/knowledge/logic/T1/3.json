[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the same reasoning problem includes irrelevant premises, your reasoning process should not change.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is a vumpus or a lorpus is a tumpus.

Max cannot be a vumpus or a lorpus (no vumpus, no lorpus).\n\nHowever, the above statement is too specific. We also know that the definition of a vumpus or a lorpus is part of what makes it a tumpus or a dumpus, so Max cannot be either. Hence, we can infer:\n\n5. Max cannot be a tumpus or a dumpus (no tumpus, no dumpus).\n\nCombining (4) and (5), we can conclude that Max cannot be a vumpus or a lorpus or a tumpus or a dumpus. Since the only remaining possibility is the term \"lorpus\" to be inapplicable to Max, we can infer:\n\n6. Max is not a lorpus.\n\nFinally, to prove that Max is not both a vumpus and a lorpus, we need to draw upon additional premises. However, based on the given premises, we can infer that Max is not both of these things.
