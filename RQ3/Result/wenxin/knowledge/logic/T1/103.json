Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the same reasoning problem includes irrelevant premises, your reasoning process should not change.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Every rompus is orange.

From premises 7 and 14, it follows that the tumpus-like Fae cannot be wooden because orpus (or Fae) is large and kind, which means it cannot be wooden due to its large size and nature of being kind. Therefore, the minimal set of premise propositions that proves (21) Fae is not wooden is: [(7), (14)].\n\nTherefore, the proof of (21) Fae is not wooden from the given premises is: [(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (13), (14), (19)]->(21)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
