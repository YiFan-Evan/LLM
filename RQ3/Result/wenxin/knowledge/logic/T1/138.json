[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the same reasoning problem includes irrelevant premises, your reasoning process should not change.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is small or a lempus is a brimpus.

Everything that is snowy or a brimpus is a numpus\n\nProof steps:\n\n1. Since Sam is a lempus, we can infer that Sam is small or a lempus.\n2. Using the second premise, we can conclude that if Sam is small or a lempus, then he is a brimpus.\n3. Therefore, since Sam is a brimpus, he must be small or a lempus by the first inference and a brimpus by the second inference.\n4. Combining these two inferences, we can infer that Sam is snowy or a brimpus using the fourth premise.\n\nConclusion: We have proven that Sam is snowy or a brimpus from the given premises using sound reasoning and deductive logic.
