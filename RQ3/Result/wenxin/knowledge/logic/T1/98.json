Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Then, based on the premise (7), we know that lempus is related to wumpus, so Sam can be inferred to be a type of wumpus. Furthermore, based on the premise (8), we know that zumpus is related to fast and moderate, so it follows that Sam can also be inferred to be fast or moderate. Finally, based on the premise (9), we know that jompus is related to transparent and opaque, but Sam is already known to be transparent (gorpus), so it follows that he cannot be a jompus.
