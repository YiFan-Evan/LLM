[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the same reasoning problem includes irrelevant premises, your reasoning process should not change.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is aggressive and a grimpus is an impus.

Therefore, Fae is small, a dumpus, and a grimpus.\n\nNow, let's use these three pieces of information to further deduce the property of Fae as a grimpus and temperate.\n\n4.

If Fae is temperate, then everything that is feisty and a shumpus is a yumpus (Premise 3).\n\nCombining (4) and (5), we can conclude that Fae must be feisty, so that everything that is aggressive and a grimpus (or, more specifically, a dumpus) will make Fae a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions that proves \"(9) Fae is temperate and a grimpus\" is: [(6), (7), (8)] -> (9)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
