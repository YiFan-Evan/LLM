You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the same reasoning problem includes irrelevant premises, your reasoning process should not change.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Numpuses are yumpuses.

From (1), (7), and (8), we know that Wumpuses are yumpuses and everything that is a grimpus, gorpus, or rompus is a lorpus. Therefore, Sally as a shumpus is also a lorpus because shumpuses are also rompuses, grimpuses, and vumpuses.\n2. From (2), (3), and (11), we know that Sally is also a vumpus because each dumpus is a shumpus and Sally is also a shumpus.\n3. From (4), (5), and (9), we know that everything that is a tumpus or vumpus is also a brimpus. Therefore, Sally as a vumpus cannot be brimpus because she has already been shown to be a dumpus and dumpuses are not brimpuses.\n4. Therefore, we can conclude that Sally cannot be a wumpus from the premises provided and thus, we have proved the proof obligation stated in (14).\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions for the proof obligation 'Sally is not a wumpus' from the given premises are: '(1)', '(2)', '(3)', '(6)', '(7)', '(8)', '(9)', '(10)', '(11)', '(12)'->'(14)' ."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
