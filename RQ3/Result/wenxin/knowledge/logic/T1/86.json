You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the same reasoning problem includes irrelevant premises, your reasoning process should not change.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is a gorpus, a lorpus, and a vumpus is a yumpus.

The first three premises about Sally's identity provide background information about her type and class.\n2. The fourth and sixth premises establish that Sally is both a gorpu and a sterpu.\n3. The fifth and eighth premises together suggest that Sally also has the attribute of being a vumpus.\n4. The seventh premise indicates that any jompus is a wumpus, and given the previous premises, it can be inferred that Sally's category is at least as high as that of a jompus.\n5. The third premise expands this category even further by saying that everything that is a gorpu and a sterpu and a shumpus is a wumpus. Therefore, it follows that Sally is also a wumpus.\n6. Finally, the final premise states that each jompus is a rompu, and since Sally has already been established as both a jompus and a wumpus, it follows that she must also be a rompu.\n\nTherefore, the conclusion \"(13) Sally is a rompus\" can be derived from the given premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
