[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the same reasoning problem includes irrelevant premises, your reasoning process should not change.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Every gorpus is a vumpus and a dumpus.

From the first premise, we know that every gorpus is a vumpus and a dumpus.\n2. From the fourth premise, we know that every lempus is cold and a brimpus.\n3. From the sixth premise, we know that each vumpus is an impus and a numpus. Therefore, if a gorpus is a vumpus, it must also be a brimpus and cold.\n4. From the fifth premise, we know that every rompus is a sterpus and a lorpus. Therefore, a brimpus is either a rompus or a lorpus.\n5. From the seventh premise, we know that each yumpus is a grimpus and a jompus. Therefore, if it is a brimpus, it must also be a grimpus.\n6. Since Polly is both a vumpus and a gorpus, she must also be a rompus and a lorpus.\n7. Finally, from the ninth premise, we know that Polly is a tumpus and a zumpus.
