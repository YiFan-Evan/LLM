[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the same reasoning problem includes irrelevant premises, your reasoning process should not change.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus is a brimpus.

The premise stating that everything that is a sterpus, a numpus, or a shumpus is a grimpus suggests that Max cannot be a numpus as he is already classified as a brimpus and yumpus and tumpus are not included in the list of species that turn into grimpus (according to premise 10).\n2. Additionally, premise 3 mentions that Max is a tumpus and there are no additional assumptions given regarding species, thus there are no conflicts for him being a tumpus in any of the premises and further reinforcing his exclusion of being a numpus.\n\nTherefore, the premises together prove the statement \"Max is not a numpus\" with certainty.
