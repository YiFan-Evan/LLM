Since Taylor is a brimpus, we can infer that Taylor is a wumpus. However, this alone is not enough to prove (18) Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTo complete the proof, we need to draw further conclusions from the premises. Based on the premise (2), we know that everything that is temperate and hot and cold and a shumpus is a wumpus. Therefore, because Taylor is also hot, it follows that Taylor is also a wumpus. Similarly, from the premise (4), we know that everything that is sweet, spicy, sour, and a brimpus is a zumpus. Therefore, because Taylor is also sweet and spicy, it follows that Taylor is also a zumpus.\n\nNow that we have established that Taylor is both a wumpus and a zumpus, we can use the premise (7) to conclude that Taylor is also a brimpus. Finally, using the premise (1), we can infer that Taylor is also a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions that prove (18) Taylor is a visionary are:\n\n(1) Wren is sweet, spicy, sour, and a brimpus if Taylor is a visionary.\n\n(2) Everything that is temperate and hot and cold and a shumpus is a wumpus.\n\n(3) Everything that is sweet, spicy, sour, and a brimpus is a zumpus.\n\n(7) Taylor is a brimpus.\n\n(18) follows from these premises in the order of their introduction.
