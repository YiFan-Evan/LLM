Since Sally is known to be happy and a rompus, we can infer that she must be a brimpus.\n\nSecondly, based on the information provided in the premises (4), (5), and (6), we can infer that if Sally is wooden and a numpus, then she must be a rompus. Since Sally is known to be wooden and a numpus, we can infer that she must be a rompus.\n\nThirdly, based on the information provided in the premises (7), (8), and (9), we can infer that if Sally is small and an impus, then she must be a wumpus. Since Sally is known to be small, we can infer that she must be a wumpus. However, this does not directly apply to Taylor, as Taylor is not known to be small. Therefore, we cannot directly infer from this premise that Taylor is a wumpus.\n\nFinally, based on the information provided in the premises (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), and (10), we can infer that Sally must be a jompus, which means she must also be opaque. Since Taylor is known to be opaque, we can infer that Taylor must also be Sally's twin brother. Based on this inference, we can conclude that Taylor must also be a visionary because of the implication in the premise (1). Therefore, from the given premises, it can be derived that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions to prove (21) Taylor is a visionary from the given premises is: [(1) if Sally is opaque and a rompus then Taylor is a visionary]."}]
