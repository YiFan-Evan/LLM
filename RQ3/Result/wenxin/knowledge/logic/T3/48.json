The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the conclusion of a reasoning process happens to be a premise in a new reasoning process, the previous reasoning can incorporate this new condition to derive a new conclusion.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is sweet, sour, and a brimpus is a yumpus.

Based on the premises (1) and (9), we know that if Sam is sweet and sour and a brimpus, then Taylor is a visionary. However, there is no direct statement indicating that Sam is sweet and sour and a brimpus.

Based on the premises (15) and (16), we know that Sam is a shumpus and transparent. The sweetness of Sam is reflected in the sweetness of Taylor according to the premises (2) and (3). And if Sam is transparent, it could also imply that Taylor is also transparent (premise (15)). Since Taylor's transparency falls within the scope of the brimpus premise (premise (5)), it could also be inferred that Taylor is a brimpus. Therefore, Taylor could potentially satisfy the condition for being a visionary.\n\nHowever, to make a direct conclusion about Taylor being a visionary, more information regarding Sam's specific nature and its relationship with Taylor would be needed. Based on the limited information provided in the premises, we cannot make such a direct conclusion.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions that proves \"(17) Taylor is a visionary\" from the given premises are: [(2), (3), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12), (14), (15)] -> (17).
