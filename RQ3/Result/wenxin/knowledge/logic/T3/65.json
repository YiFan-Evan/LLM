Since Max is an impus and Impuses are shumpuses (according to premise (9)), Taylor is also a shumpus.\n* Shumpuses are jompuses (premise (2)).\n* Jompuses are bright (premise (7)).\n* Each shumpus is not melodic (premise (8)).\n\nBased on these pieces of information, it can be inferred that Taylor is a visionary because he is a shumpus that is not melodic and thus he fulfils the condition stated in premise (1) to make Taylor a visionary.\n\nHowever, if you only have the premises given above, there is insufficient information to conclude that Taylor himself is actually a visionary, as only Max is referred to by name and mentioned to be an impus.
