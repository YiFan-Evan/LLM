You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the conclusion of a reasoning process happens to be a premise in a new reasoning process, the previous reasoning can incorporate this new condition to derive a new conclusion.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Numpuses are transparent and vumpuses and gorpuses.

Therefore, Taylor, as a gorpus, must also be transparent.\n\nFrom the premise (3), we know that vumpuses are brown, dumpuses, and shumpuses.

Taylor as a gorpus could potentially act aggressively in response to Taylor's aggressive characteristics in accordance with this rule.\n\nHowever, Taylor as a visionary cannot be proven solely from these premises because Taylor could also have other traits that make him a visionary.
