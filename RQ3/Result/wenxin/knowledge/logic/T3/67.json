Premises such as \"(1) if Polly is blue and orange and brown and red and a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary\" establish a specific correlation between Polly's features and Taylor's state, but the premises do not provide any direct evidence or inference for Taylor's status. The premise regarding Polly's characteristics only serves to link Taylor's behavior or condition to certain attributes of Polly, not to Taylor's own qualities or state.
