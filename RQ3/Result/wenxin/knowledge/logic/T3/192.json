Therefore, since Rex is a sweet dumpus, he is also fruity.\n\nFrom the premises (16), (17), and (23), we know that tumpuses are brimpuses, each brimpus is a tumpus, and each tumpus is not amenable. Therefore, since Taylor is a jompus, he is also a brimpus.\n\nFrom the premises (3), (4), and (5), we know that each impus is a dumpus, each dumpus is lorpus, and tumpuses are impuses. Therefore, Taylor, being a brimpus, is also a tumpus.\n\nFinally, from the premises (26) and (25), we know that Rex is cold and Rex is a numpus.
