From (6), we know that everything that is a sterpus or a grimpus or a lempus is a dumpus. Therefore, Alex, being a brimpus, is also a dumpus by the universal instantiation rule. From (9), we know that shumpuses are yumpuses, and Alex is a shumpus. Therefore, Alex is also a tumpus by the definition of tumpus. Finally, from (5) and (10), we know that brimpuses are sterpuses and Alex is a brimpus, which implies that he is also a sterpus.
