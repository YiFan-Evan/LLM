Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Since Fae is a gorpu (premise 9), it follows that Fae is either earthy or blue, based on the second premise.\n2. Since Fae is a shumpus (premise 10), Fae cannot be earthy.\n3.
