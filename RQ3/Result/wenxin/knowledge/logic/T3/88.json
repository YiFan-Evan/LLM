Based on the given premises, here's an argument to prove that Taylor is a visionary:\n\nFrom the premise (4), we know that \"everything that is amenable, kind, and a rompus is a wumpus\". And from the premise (7), we know that Alex is kind and therefore, Alex is a rompus.\n\nFrom the premise (8), we know that Alex is large.\n\nCombining these two premises, we infer that Alex is amenable, kind, and large. Since Alex is amenable, kind, and large, she is a dumpus.\n\nFrom the premise (2), we know that \"everything that is luminous, liquid, and a lempus is a tumpus\". Since Alex is amenable, kind, and large, she is also luminous, liquid and a lempus. Therefore, she is also a tumpus.\n\nNow from the premises (5) and (6), we know that everything that is small, large, and a dumpus is a gorpus and everything that is orange, brown, and a dumpus is a jompus. Therefore, Alex being a dumpus means she is small, large and a gorpus or orange, brown and a jompus.\n\nGiven the above premises and inference, it follows that Taylor is a visionary because she is kind, large, transparent and has Alex as her primary attribute. Therefore, Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions to prove the proof obligation from the given premises is: [(7), (8), (9), (1), (4), (6), (13), (14), (15)].->(15).\n\nTherefore, the answer is: [(7), (8), (9), (1), (4), (6), (14), (15)].->(15)."}]
