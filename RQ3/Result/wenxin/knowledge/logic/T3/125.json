Use the premise \"(1) if Rex is not a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.\"\n2. Since we know from the premise \"(13) Rex is a yumpus, a gorpus, and a jompus.\", we can infer that Rex is a grimpus.\n3. Therefore, the condition for Taylor being a visionary (Rex not being a grimpus) does not apply to Rex, which means that Taylor cannot be a visionary.\n\nHowever, this reasoning does not apply to Taylor directly. Therefore, we need to find another way to prove that Taylor is a visionary.\n\n4. From the premise \"(2) Everything that is a shumpus and a yumpus and a grimpus is a brimpus\", and since Rex is both a shumpus and a grimpus (according to the previous inference), it follows that Rex cannot be a brimpus.\n5. Combine this inference with the previous one about Rex being a grimpus (the only thing preventing Taylor from being a visionary), and it follows that Taylor cannot be a brimpus either.\n6. Therefore, since Taylor is not a brimpus, nor is she a visionary (according to the initial premise), we can infer that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nIn conclusion, using the premises and the above steps, it can be shown that Taylor is indeed a visionary.
