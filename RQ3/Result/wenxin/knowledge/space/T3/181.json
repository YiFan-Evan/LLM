When you move in the counter-clockwise direction, you will travel a total of 12 steps, which is 6 more than the distance between the apiary and the fountain. Therefore, you will reach the fountain before moving in the clockwise direction. In addition, moving in the clockwise direction will take you a total of 20 steps, which is greater than the distance between the fountain and the end of the path. Therefore, you will reach the end of the path before moving in the clockwise direction. Therefore, you will find a fountain when you move in all directions."}]
