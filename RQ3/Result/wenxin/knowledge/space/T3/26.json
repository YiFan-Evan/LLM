Note that when you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, it's like moving in a clockwise direction for 2 steps. And when you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, it's like moving in a counter-clockwise direction for 5 steps. This results in the following changes to your position: clockwise - 2 steps (Welsh Springer Spaniel), counter-clockwise - 2 steps (tiger), counter-clockwise - 3 steps (velvet), counter-clockwise - 5 steps (switch), clockwise - 10 steps (stopwatch)."}]
