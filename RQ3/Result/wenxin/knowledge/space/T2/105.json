I moved clockwise from the oboe to find the items on the path, starting with the baseball, bell pepper, tights, Christmas stocking, brass, pizza, meerkat, eastern diamondback rattlesnake, and spoonbill. However, your description has instructed me to move in a counter-clockwise direction starting from the brass item. So moving counter-clockwise from the brass, I would have found items 8, 7, 3 steps around the path. Since the last item was a spoonbill, that is what I found."}]
