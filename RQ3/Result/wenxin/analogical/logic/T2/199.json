Then, using the proposition (2), we know that a wumpus is a vumpus, a sterpus, and a brimpus. Since Polly is identified as a rompus in the premise (9), it follows that she is also a vumpus or an impus or a yumpus. Furthermore, using the proposition (4), we know that everything that is a lempus or a jompus or a lorpus is a dumpus. Therefore, since Polly is identified as a wumpus in the premise (8), it follows that she is also a dumpus. Finally, using the proposition (7), we know that vumpuses are rompuses and dumpuses are identified as brimpuses and sterpuses. Therefore, Polly is also identified as a lempus or an impus or a yumpus.\n\nTo complete the proof, we can combine these intermediate conclusions to establish that Polly is indeed a lempus or an impus or a yumpus.
