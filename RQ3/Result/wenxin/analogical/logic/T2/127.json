The only proposition introduced after establishing that Rex is aggressive is (19), which indicates that Rex is a jompus. This jompus is considered a shumpus (from (12)), which in turn is identified as a lorpus in the fourth premise. Since it has already been shown that brown, orange, blue, red, and a lorpus are grimpus (from (20)), it follows that Rex's brown, orange, blue, red, and a lorpus nature contributes to his being a grimpus. Since Rex is also aggressive (from (1)), angry (from (3)), and amenable (from (2)), he also meets the requirements for being a dumpus (from (16)), liquid (from (8)), and metallic (from (9)). Finally, Rex's wooden nature is inferred from (4). Therefore, the combination of all these properties proves that Rex is luminous, liquid, metallic, wooden, and a lorpus."}]
