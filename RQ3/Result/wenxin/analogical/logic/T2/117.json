You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

From the premises (1) and (2), we can infer that if something is a wumpus, it is also a sterpus. Then, from the premise (3), we can infer that if something is a gorpus, it is also a zumpus. Using these inferences, we can prove that Fae is also a zumpus, using the following inference: (13) + (3) \u2192 Fae is a zumpus.\n\nFrom the premise (4), we know that if something is slow and a vumpus, it is a gorpus. Therefore, using the inference from the previous step, we can infer that Fae is also a gorpus. Then, from the premise (8), we can infer that if something is sweet and a vumpus, it is a brimpus. Hence, Fae can be proven to be a brimpus using the following inference: (14) + (8) \u2192 Fae is a brimpus.\n\nFinally, using the premises (6), (16), and (9), we can infer that if something is snowy and a wumpus, it is also a dumpus.
