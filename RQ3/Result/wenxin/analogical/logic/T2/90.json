You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Based on the premises given, Alex can be considered a member of the \"tumpus\" and \"rompus\" categories, both of which have specific physical and environmental traits. In particular, Alex is both windy and sunny, indicating that he is a \"tumpus\", which is made of wood and metal, and also temperate and cold, indicating that he is a \"rompus\". Since we know that impuses are also characterized by their floral, fruity, brimpuses, and sterpuses traits, it follows that Alex could also be classified as an \"impus\".
