First, we use the premises (1) and (3) to infer that jompuses and gorpuses are members of the same class. Then, using the premise (5), we infer that each yumpus is a shumpus, which is equivalent to saying that each shumpus is a yumpus. By virtue of the premise (6), vumpuses are wumpuses, which in turn implies that vumpuses are yumpuses. Alex is a shumpus, and therefore, Alex is also a vumpus. From the premise (7), we know that every sterpus is a lempus, a yumpus, and a gorpus. Since Alex is a sterpus, he must also be a jompus.
