(3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Sam is opaque, a yumpus, and a lempus.\n\nWe can infer that Sam is a jompus from the following reasoning:\n\nFrom premises 7 and 9, we know that each numpus is mean and a tumpus and a jompus, and Sam is a numpus and a tumpus, therefore Sam must be a jompus according to the modus ponens rule of deduction. \n\nSimilarly, from the first line of premise 7 (each numpus is mean and a tumpus and a jompus) we know that each numpus belongs to three types of beings: mean, tumpus, jompus, Sam being included in the set of numpuses entails that he belongs to one of these three types of beings as well; given that he is also included in the set of tumpuses (as stated in premise 5), it follows that he must also belong to the set of jompuses. Sam's property of being opaque can be explained by premise 8; however it doesn't have any impact on the deduction regarding his being a jompus.\n\nSo Sam is a jompus because it is implied by the information given in the premises as well as other premises given earlier. Sam is also stated to be sunny (premise 1) which implies that he must be one of the three types of beings mentioned in the first line of premise 7, hence he must be a jompus.
