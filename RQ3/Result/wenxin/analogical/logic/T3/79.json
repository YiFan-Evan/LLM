Here's how:\n\n1. The premise \"(1) if Fae is a shumpus then Taylor is a visionary\" provides us with a direct implication between Fae being a shumpus and Taylor being a visionary.\n2. Based on the premises \"(3) Each grimpus is a tumpus and a shumpus\", \"(9) Fae is an impus and a numpus\" and \"(10) Fae is a tumpus and a grimpus\", we can infer that Fae is a shumpus.\n3. Combining the above inference with the first step, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary if Fae is a shumpus.\n4.
