Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

From the first premise, we know that if Polly is not a brimpus and Polly is not a wumpus, then Taylor is a visionary. 2. From the second and third premises, we know that if something is a grimpus or a tumpus or a wumpus or a brimpus, then it is a yumpus or a gorpus. 3. The fourth premise tells us that all yumpuses are gorpuses. Therefore, from these three premises, we can infer that if Polly is not a yumpus or a grimpus or a tumpus or a wumpus or a brimpus, then Taylor is a visionary. 4. Since the fifth premise tells us that Polly is not a yumpus, we can conclude that Polly is not a grimpus, a tumpus, a wumpus, or a brimpus. Therefore, the condition of Polly not being a brimpus and wumpus is met. 5. Finally, using the condition stated in the first premise, we can infer that Taylor is a visionary. Therefore, the final answer is: Taylor is a visionary."}]
