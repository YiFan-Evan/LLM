[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Start with the premise \"(1) Everything that is rainy or a numpus is a grimpus.\" Since Sam is a tumpus, he is also a numpus by premise (2). Therefore, Sam is either rainy or a numpus.\n\n2. The next step is to use the premise \"(4) Everything that is amenable or a numpus is a lorpus.\" Since Sam is a numpus (by the previous step), he is also amenable. Therefore, Sam is either rainy or a lorpus.\n\n3. Finally, we can use the premise \"(5) Everything that is sour or a jompus is a vumpus.\" Since Sam is sour (we don't know if he is rainy or a jompus), he must be a vumpus.
