You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Then, from the premises about wumpus being large, small, or a yumpus, we can infer that Fae is a yumpus. Also, from the premises about vumpus being overcast, sunny, or a rompus, we can infer that Fae is not overcast. Finally, from the premises about luminous and metallic being associated with yumpus, we can infer that Fae is either luminous or metallic. However, we cannot determine whether Fae is luminous or metallic with certainty from the given premises. If we further assume that Fae is overcast, we could infer that Fae is neither luminous nor metallic, and then draw no conclusions. On the other hand, if we choose to treat the statements regarding Fae's luminosity and metallience separately (that Fae is not overcast), we could conclude that Fae is a type of yumpus, with specific details on its color or appearance still undetermined.
