If Sam is not bitter (premise 10), then Taylor is a visionary (premise 1).\n2. Sam is a rompus (premise 24).\n3. Each rompus is a grimpus (premise 7).\n4. Each grimpus is Taylor (from premise 24 and 7, via universal instantiation).\n\nTherefore, based on premises (1), (2), and (3), Taylor is a visionary.\n\nHowever, to prove that Taylor is a visionary directly from the premises given in the problem, we need to use the following additional premises:\n\n1. Every numpus is an impus (premise 23).\n2. Dumpuses are not orange (premise 18).\n3. Numpuses are dumpuses (from premise 11 and 23, via biconditional introduction).\n\nCombining these three premises with the already derived premises, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary, as proven in the first part of the answer.
