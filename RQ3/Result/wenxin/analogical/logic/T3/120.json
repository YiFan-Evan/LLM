[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

We start with premises 1 and 2 to establish that Alex is a lorpus, and then use premise 3 to conclude that Alex is also a zumpus. Thesis 4 establishes that Alex is a sterpus, and thus not a gorpus. Then, using the definition of tumpus from premise 6, we infer that Alex is also a tumpus. Finally, using the fact that Alex is a shumpus and a yumpus from premise 12, we conclude that Alex is also a tumpus.\n\nWe also use premises 7 and 13 to rule out that Alex is a brimpus, as it would make him a dumpus by definition.
