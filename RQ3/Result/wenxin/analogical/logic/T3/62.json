Then, we can use the premises (7) and (8) to infer that Wren is both a yumpus and a tumpus. Based on the premises (2) and (3), Wren must also be a numpus and a shumpus, respectively. Furthermore, from the premises (4) and (5), we know that everything that is large and small and a numpus is a zumpus or a lempus, respectively. Therefore, based on these premises, Taylor must also be a zumpus or a lempus. Finally, the premises (9), (10), and (12) indicate that Wren is metallic, floral, and fruity, respectively.
