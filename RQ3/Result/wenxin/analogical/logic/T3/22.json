To prove this, we need to use the premise (1) and the inference rule of Modus Ponens. The premises (1) and (15) state that Max is a numpus or a dumpus or a zumpus or a rompus and Max is a lempus, a numpus, a dumpus, or a zumpus, respectively. Since Taylor is one of the possible forms of Max (as stated in (15)), and if Max is a shumpus, then Taylor is a visionary (as stated in (1)), it follows that Taylor is a visionary. The inference rule of Modus Ponens was used to prove this conclusion. The premises and the inference rule were consistent with each other to ensure that the conclusion was derived logically from the premises."}]
