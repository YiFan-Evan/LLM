The first premise states that if Alex is not a brimpus, then Taylor is a visionary. We know from the sixth premise that Alex is a brimpus.

The fourth and fifth premises state that every lempus is a wumpus and every tumpus is a numpus, respectively. However, Alex is not a numpus, so he cannot be a tumpus.

However, it also means that Taylor must be either a shumpus or a jompus. If Taylor is a jompus, then she cannot be a visionary because she does not satisfy the conditions in the first premise.
