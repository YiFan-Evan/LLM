Start with premise (1), \"Everything that is large and a rompus is a tumpus.\" Apply it to Wren, which is a dumpus and a rompus, thus Wren is a tumpus.\n2. Then, use premise (7), \"Wren is wooden,\" to conclude that Wren is wooden.\n3. Next, apply premise (8), \"Wren is cold,\" to Wren, which is already a tumpus, to show that Wren is cold and a tumpus.\n4. Finally, use premise (9), \"Everything that is wooden and a yumpus is a vumpus,\" to infer that Wren is a vumpus because it already has properties of being a tumpus and wooden.\n5.
