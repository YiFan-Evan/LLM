If we were to infer that Stella is opaque, would this change our understanding of her nature?\n\nAnswers:\n\n1. To prove that Stella is a wumpus, we need the following premises: (1) and (5). From (1), we know that everything that is luminous and a wumpus is a gorpus. From (5), we know that everything that is melodic and a wumpus is a grimpus. Combining these two premises, we can infer that if Stella is a wumpus, then she is a grimpus.\n2. To prove that Stella is a yumpus, we need the following premises: (4) and (8). Using (4), we know that if Stella is orange and a gorpus, then she is a yumpus. Using (8), we know that Stella is a lempus. Combining these two premises, we can infer that if Stella is orange and a lempus, then she is a yumpus.\n3. No, assuming that Stella is opaque does not change our understanding of her nature because our reasoning for her nature relies solely on her physical appearance (orange, lempus, etc.) rather than any specific attribute such as transparency or opacity. We have already inferred from her orange color and lempus nature that she falls into certain categories of creatures such as numpuses and gorpuses.
