[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

From the first two premises above, we can infer that if Max is a vumpus or a lorpus, then it must be a dumpus.\n5. From the third premise, we know that if Max is a lempus or a zumpus, then it must be a dumpus.\n6. Combining the last three inferences, we can infer that Max cannot be a vumpus or a lorpus, because they are all identified as dumpus types by the first two premises.\n7. Finally, using the fourth premise that Max is not a dumpus, we can conclude that Max cannot be a vumpus or a lorpus, because vumpuses and lorpuses are dumpus types and cannot exist in the same category as Max.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Max is not a lorpus and Max is not a vumpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
