Then, using the transitivity of the \"cold/lempus\" predicate, we can infer that if Fae is cold and a sterpus, then Fae is a lempus. Finally, using the fact that Fae is fast and applying the \"fast/sumpus\" negation, we can infer that Fae is not a sumpus. Therefore, the premises provide sufficient evidence to prove that Fae is cold and a lempus.\n\nThe minimal set of premise propositions for proving (18) Fae is cold and a lempus are: (14), (16), and (17).\n\nSimilarly, we can prove (18) using additional premises (9), (8), and (6) in combination with our initial assumptions, thus proving that Fae is cold and a lempus.\n\nHowever, in order to prove (18) Fae is cold and a lempus from the given premises alone, we need to follow a certain derivation process:\n\n(14) Fae is cold \u21d2 Fae is a lempus [transitivity]\n(17) Fae is fast \u21d2 \u00acFae is a sumpus [disjunctive syllogism]\n(2) Everything that is cold and a lempus is a numpus \u21d2 Fae is a numpus\n(1) Everything that is sour and a lempus is a sterpus.
