[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

The minimal set of premise propositions that lead to this conclusion are (6), (7), and (9).\n\nRelated problems:\n\n1. How can we prove that Sally is a vumpus if we only have the premise (1) that Sally is a yumpus?\n\nAnswer: We cannot prove that Sally is a vumpus from the premise (1) alone. The category of vumpus is more general than that of yumpus and encompasses the latter.\n\n2. What is the relationship between a tumpus and a dumpus? Can we prove it using the given premises?\n\nAnswer: We cannot use the given premises to prove that a tumpus is a dumpus. The category of dumpus is more specific than that of tumpus and does not encompass all tumpuses.\n\n3. If Sally is a jompus, what else can we infer from the given premises?\n\nAnswer: We can infer from the given premises that each jompus is also a lempus, because all lempuses are jompuses. However, we cannot infer that Sally is also a lempus based on her being a jompus alone."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son. (1) Sally is a yumpus.
