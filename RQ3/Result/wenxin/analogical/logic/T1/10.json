[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

To do so, we start from the premises that state that everything that is a grimpus or a tumpus is a yumpus, and that everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a yumpus. Since Polly is not a yumpus, it follows that she cannot be a grimpus or a tumpus. Furthermore, since everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a gorpus, and Polly is not a yumpus, it can also be inferred that Polly cannot be a wumpus or a brimpus.

Then, we use premise 1 to infer that if something is a grimpus or a tumpus, it is a yumpus. Therefore, because Polly is not a yumpus (as stated in premise 4), we can infer that she cannot be a grimpus or a tumpus.\n\nNext, we use premise 2 to infer that if something is a wumpus or a brimpus, it is a gorpus.
