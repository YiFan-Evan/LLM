You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

However, since Sam is already identified as a tumpus, he cannot be a grimpus. Therefore, we move to the second premise and conclude that everything that is bright or a jompus is a numpus.
