The premise stating that every zumpus is a vumpus (premise 2) and every lempus is a wumpus (premise 9) together lead to the conclusion that every zumpus and lempus is a vumpus.\n2. Alex is a tumpus (premise 7) and every tumpus is a numpus (premise 4) implies that Alex is a numpus.\n3. Alex is a gorpus (premise 9) and every gorpus is a gorpus (premise 1) proves that Alex is a gorpus and a numpus.\n4. From the above premises, it follows that Alex cannot be a brimpus, as a brimpus is not a zumpus, not a lempus, and not a tumpus.
