We can establish that Stella is a gorpus (Premise 8), which is also a lempus (Premise 6).\n\nNow, let's use these two pieces of information to build a case against Stella being large. Based on premise (14), we know that yumpuses are not large. Since Stella is a yumpuse, we can infer that she is not large.\n\nFinally, we have to verify that our reasoning is sound and that we have indeed proven Stella is not large. We have already established that she is not large in the previous step, so there is no need to repeat the argument here.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions to prove (21) Stella is not large is: [(6), (7), (14)]->(21)."}]
