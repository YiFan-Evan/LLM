Start with the premise (18) Rex is angry. This suggests that Rex is passionate and has a strong emotional response.\n2. Combine this with (19) Rex is amenable. This indicates that Rex is willing to listen and respond positively to others' requests or suggestions.\n3. Consider (1) Everything that is brown, orange, blue, red, and a lorpus is a grimpus. Since Rex is angry and amenable, he could be described as passionate and responsive, which fits the description of a lorpus.\n4. Apply the same reasoning to (5) Everything that is luminous, liquid, metallic, wooden, and a lorpus is a dumpus. Since Rex is angry and amenable, he could also be described as having a metallic or wooden quality, which fits the description of a dumpus.\n5. Finally, consider (21) Rex is luminous, liquid, metallic, wooden, and a lorpus.
