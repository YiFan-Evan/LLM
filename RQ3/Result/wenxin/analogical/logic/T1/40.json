You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

From (8), we know that impuses are dumpuses, which means that Sally cannot be a dumpus. However, we also know from (9) that Sally is a gorpus and a jompus and a lorpus, which is different from a shumpus. Therefore, since Sally cannot be a dumpus and also be a shumpus at the same time, it follows that she cannot be a shumpus. Finally, (6) tells us that each brimpus is a rompus, and thus Sally is not only a brimpus but also a rompus, supporting our conclusion that she is not a shumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Sally is not a shumpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
