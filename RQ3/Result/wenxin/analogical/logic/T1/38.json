The minimal set of premise propositions required for this derivation are (16), (17), and (18), which jointly lead to the conclusion (20). The reasoning goes as follows:\n\n1. Premise (17) states that Stella is temperate.\n2. Premise (18) claims that Stella is a tumpus.\n3. By combining these two premises, we can infer that Stella is a temperate tumpus.\n4.
