Finally, using the deduction rule of disjunctions, we can conclude that \"Sam is either a vumpus or a lorpus or he is a jompus\". Since Sam is already shown to be loud and tumpus-like based on the previous steps, it follows that Sam must be a jompus.\n\nTherefore, we can prove that Sam is a jompus.
