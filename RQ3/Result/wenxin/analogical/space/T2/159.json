Then, you move clockwise by 11 steps to reach the pelican. The pelican is located on the path directly opposite the chest, and it is the last item you encounter.\n\nNow, let's go through each of the items you mentioned on the path:\n\n1. Plectrum - No change from where you start from.\n2. Knee pad - Moves clockwise to next dot on the path.\n3. American bullfrog - No change from where you are after reaching the knee pad.\n4. Fly - Also moves clockwise, which brings you to a position between the fly and the necklace.\n5. Necklace - Moves counter-clockwise, so you pass by it as you continue clockwise around the path.\n6. Church - After passing by the necklace, you now move counter-clockwise and reach the church.\n7. Killer whale - No change from where you are after reaching the church.\n8. Agama - Moves counter-clockwise to reach it after passing by the killer whale.\n9. Shoji - Also moves counter-clockwise, so you pass by it as you continue moving clockwise around the path.\n10. English Springer Spaniel - No change from where you are after passing by the shoji.\n11. Traffic light - Moves counter-clockwise to reach it after passing by the English Springer Spaniel.\n12. Thimble - After passing by the traffic light, you move clockwise to reach it.\n13. Spindle - Also moves clockwise, so you pass by it as you continue moving counter-clockwise around the path.\n14. Pelican - After passing by the spindle, you move counter-clockwise and reach it.\n15. European garden spider - You start moving clockwise again from here, but only by 11 steps, which brings you back to where you started from (i.e., directly opposite the chest).\n16. Shopping cart - No change from where you are after reaching the European garden spider.\n17. Black-footed ferret - Also no change from where you are after reaching the shopping cart.\n18. Green iguana - Moves counter-clockwise to reach it after passing by the black-footed ferret.\n19. Oxygen mask - No change from where you are after reaching the green iguana.\n\nTherefore, your final position is directly opposite the chest and directly opposite a pelican, which is what you will find when you finish moving around the path in both directions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

This item is the only one in between your current position and where you started moving counter-clockwise, so you encounter it during your clockwise movement. The shoji is a door screen and thus not directly opposite the chest.\n\nSo far, your path consists of the following items:\n\n1. Plectrum\n2. Knee pad\n3. American bullfrog\n4. Fly\n5. Necklace\n6. Church\n7. Killer whale\n8. Agama\n9. Shopping cart\n10. Pelican\n11. Garden spider\n12. Traffic light\n13. Shoji\n14. English Springer Spaniel\n15. Oxygen mask\n\nWhen you start moving counter-clockwise from the shoji, you will meet no items until you reach the last item, which is the chest, so you will encounter it after moving 13 steps in total, since you move clockwise by 11 steps and then counter-clockwise by 2 steps (i.e., you go from the shoji to the chest)."}]
