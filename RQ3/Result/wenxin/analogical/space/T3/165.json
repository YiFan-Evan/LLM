The first part of your movement takes you from the home theater to the radio telescope. The next three movements in counter-clockwise direction are a total of 18 steps, which should take you to the hartebeest, followed by a movement of 10 steps in counter-clockwise direction to the pole, and then a movement of 6 steps in counter-clockwise direction to the vulture. Finally, you move 19 steps in counter-clockwise direction to the lampshade. Therefore, you end up back at the radio telescope.\n\nSince you started at the top of the path, which was designated as the home theater, there is no way to leave it through the counter-clockwise path you took and return to it.
