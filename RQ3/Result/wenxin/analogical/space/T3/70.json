You now move towards the south to reach the dung beetle. How do you move from the tripod to the dung beetle?\nSolution: Move counter-clockwise along the path 4 more steps, reaching a water buffalo.\n\n3. You then move clockwise along the path 10 steps to reach a candle. How do you move towards the south to find a large circle?\nSolution: Move clockwise along the path another 10 steps and then move south for 4 more steps to reach a large circle surrounded by boulders.\n\nAfter moving around the path according to these instructions, you will find a large circle in the south of the map, with a line of boulders stretching along the ground towards the west and a pine tree standing to the north of it.
