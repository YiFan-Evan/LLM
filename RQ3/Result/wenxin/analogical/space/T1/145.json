Firstly, you moved clockwise by 1 step, which took you to the shipwreck. Then, you moved counter-clockwise by 1 step, which took you to the red king crab. After that, you moved clockwise by 16 steps, which took you to the Alpine ibex. Then, you moved counter-clockwise by 4 steps, which took you to the sea urchin. After that, you moved counter-clockwise by 13 steps, which took you to the brain coral. However, from the position of the brain coral, it was unclear which way to go next as your movements in different directions were of different lengths.
