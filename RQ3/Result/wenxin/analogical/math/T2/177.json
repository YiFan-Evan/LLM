First, we need to multiply the function by a factor that integrates easily (here it's 1 + x^2), and then we need to take the derivative of that product with respect to x. The indefinite integral of e^(3x - 1) / (1 + x^2) is:\n\n\u222be^(3x - 1) / (1 + x^2) dx = e^(3x - 1) * arctan(x) + C\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222be^(3*4 - 1) / (1 + 4^2) dx = e^(11) * arctan(4) + C = approximately 88657909965 + C\n\nTo find the final result, we need to evaluate the constant C.
