After the substitution, the indefinite integral becomes e^u * u. To evaluate this indefinite integral, we need to integrate e^u * du and solve for u. The indefinite integral is e^u * u + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, let's substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral. We have e^u * u + C = e^(ln(4)) * (ln(4)) + C = 4 * e^ln(4) + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4 * e^(2) = 8.\n\nNow let's see another function: f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 5.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of f(x), we can use the substitution u = x^2 + 2x to simplify the expression. After the substitution, the indefinite integral becomes u * x = (x^3 + 2x^2 + x) * x + C.\n\nTo evaluate this indefinite integral, we need to integrate (x^3 + 2x^2 + x) * dx and solve for u.

After the substitution, the indefinite integral becomes u * x = (x^4 - 5x^3 - 10x^2) * x + C*u + C*x, where C is a constant.\n\nTo evaluate this indefinite integral, we need to integrate (x^4 - 5x^3 - 10x^2) * dx and solve for u and C.
