The indefinite integral can be rewritten as (1/2)sin(2x) + C, where C is a constant. To substitute 'x=4', we need to multiply by 2 and add C back again. The result is (1/2)sin(8) + C. To find the integer result, we need to round down the decimal to the nearest integer. Therefore, the final answer is: 2.\n\nNow, let's consider another function expression: 'sin(x)^3'.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of 'sin(x)^3', we can use the power rule and derivative of the sine function to get the indefinite integral as x * sin(x)^2. Again, to substitute 'x=4', we need to multiply by x and add the indefinite integral back again. The result is 4*sin(4)^2. To find the integer result, we need to round down the decimal to the nearest integer. Therefore, the final answer is: 40.\n\nFinally, let's consider the function expression: 'x^4 + 3x^2'.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of 'x^4 + 3x^2', we can use the substitution method and simplify the indefinite integral by substituting x with 4. The indefinite integral becomes 4^4 + 3*4^2 = 448. To find the integer result, we need to round down to the nearest integer.
