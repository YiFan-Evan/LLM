Therefore, the indefinite integral of the function is (1 - sin(x)^2) * (exp(x) - exp(-x)) / 2.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we need to evaluate the integral at this value.

The integral of sin(x) is cos(x), and the integral of tan(x) is x + \u03c0/2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of the function is cos(x) * (x + \u03c0/2).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=\u03c0/4', we need to evaluate the integral at this value.

The integral of x^3 is x^2 * (ln|x| + C), where C is a constant, and the integral of 3x^2 is 6x * x + C. Finally, we integrate the term 2x + 5 to get 2 + 5*ln|x| + C. Therefore, the indefinite integral of x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x + 5 is x^2 * ln|x| + 6 * x^2/2 + 7 * ln|x| + C for some constant C.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we need to evaluate the integral at this value. So, the result will be 16 * ln4 + 6 * (4)^2/2 + 7 * ln4 + C. To find the integer result, we need to round down this expression.
