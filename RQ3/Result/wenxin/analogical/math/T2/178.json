Integral of sin(x) * (1 - cos(2x)) / sinh(x): This is a bit tricky because we need to evaluate the indefinite integral of sin(x) * (1 - cos(2x)) and then integrate with respect to x. To do this, we need to use the trigonometric identities for sin(x), cos(x), and sin(2x).\n\nFirst, we need to know that cos(2x) = (cos(x))^2 - (sin(x))^2, and then use that to rewrite the function as sin(x) * (1 - (sin(x))^2) / sinh(x).\n\nThen, using the derivative of sinh(x), we can simplify this to sin(x)^3 / sinh(x)^2.\n\nFinally, we can integrate this using the fundamental theorem of calculus to get \u222bsin(x)^3 / sinh(x)^2 dx = \u222bsin(x)^3 dx.\n\n2.
