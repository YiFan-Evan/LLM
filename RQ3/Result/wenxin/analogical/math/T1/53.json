Therefore, the value of C is -6.\n\nQ3: What is the indefinite integral of (sin(x))^3 dx?\nA3: To calculate the indefinite integral of (sin(x))^3 dx, we need to integrate the function (sin(x))^3 * cos(x). The result is -\u222bcos(x) * (sin(x))^3 dx = -\u222b(sin(2x))^2 dx. The indefinite integral of sin(2x)^2 is (cos(2x))/2 + C, where C is a constant.
