[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution. Finally, provide the answer to the original problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(sin(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of ln(sin(x)), we can use the chain rule and integrate ln(u) using the natural logarithm function, where u = sin(x). This will give us u/cos(x) + C, where C is a constant. Therefore, the indefinite integral of ln(sin(x)) is (sin(x)/cos(x)) + C.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply need to replace x with 4. This will give us (sin(4))/cos(4) + C.\n\nFinally, to provide the final answer as an integer, we need to round down the result. Therefore, the final answer is: 1.\n\nNow let's consider another function expression: 'e^x - 2x^2'.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of 'e^x - 2x^2', we can use the product rule and integrate e^x and subtract 2x^2. This will give us e^x - 2x^2 + C, where C is a constant. Therefore, the indefinite integral of 'e^x - 2x^2' is e^x - 2x^2 + C.\n\nNow to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply need to replace x with 4 and add a constant term of 1 to ensure that the result is a positive integer. This will give us e^(4) - 2 * 4^2 + 1 = 7.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7.\n\nFinally, let's consider the function expression: 'x^3 / (e^x - 1)'.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of 'x^3 / (e^x - 1)', we can use the quotient rule and integrate x^3 over the denominator and subtract x from the numerator. This will give us (e^x - x^3) / (e^x - 1) + C, where C is a constant. Therefore, the indefinite integral of 'x^3 / (e^x - 1)' is (e^x - x^3) / (e^x - 1) + C.\n\nNow to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply need to replace x with 4 and add a constant term of 0 to ensure that the result is a positive integer. This will give us (4 * e^(4) - (4)^3) / (e^(4) - 1) = 56.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 56."}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(sin(x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Therefore, the final answer is: 1."}]
