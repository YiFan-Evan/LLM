The result will be an expression involving x and its derivative. We will also need to take into account the fact that we are excluding the constant C from the indefinite integral.

Therefore, the final answer is: 57.\n\nFinally, let's look at another problem.\n\nThe function is: (x^2 - 1)^0.5.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of (x^2 - 1)^0.5, we can use the derivative of the power function and the exponential function. The result will be an expression involving exponents and logs. We will also need to take into account the fact that we are excluding the constant C from the indefinite integral.

To do this, we need to replace 'x' with '4'. So, we have:\n\n\u222b((4^2 - 1)^0.5)dx = (e^(ln|(4^2 - 1)^0.5|) + C) | We need to evaluate ln((4^2 - 1)^0.5). To do this, we can use the definition of ln: ln(x) = (the number of times you can make a unit in a given distance divided by your starting distance). So for our example: ln((4^2 - 1)^0.5) = ln((\u221a(8))^0.5) = ln(\u221a{8*\u221a2}) = ln(\u221a{8*\u221a{8/\u221a2}}) = ln(\u221a{64}) = ln(8). So, now we have our expression as: ((e^(ln8) + C) dx. We need to evaluate this at x=4. To do this, we replace x with 4 and multiply by dx. This becomes: ((e^(ln8) * dx at x=4) = ((e^(ln8/3)) dx at x=4 = e^(ln8/3). The value of ln8/3 is approximately 0.977 so this becomes: e*0.977 = approximately 1.
