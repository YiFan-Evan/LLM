In this case, the indefinite integral of e^x/e^x at x=4 is undefined because e^(4) is an infinite value.\n\nIf you want to find the value of the derivative at x=4, you can use the definite integral:\n\n\u222b(e^x)d(e^x) from x=1 to x=4 = e^4 + C\n\nand then solve for C to find the derivative at x=4. However, as mentioned above, this is also undefined because e^(4) is infinite.\n\nIn summary, the indefinite integral of e^x/e^x at x=4 is undefined because e^(4) is infinite.
