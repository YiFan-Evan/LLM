To find the value of 'x' that when substituted into this expression yields '4', we need to solve for the value of 'sin(9)*\u03c0' and 'cos(9)*\u03c0'. To simplify the process, we can use a calculator or a table of trigonometric values. The correct value of 'sin(9)*\u03c0' is approximately -0.993 and 'cos(9)*\u03c0' is approximately -0.365. Substituting these values into the expression and simplifying, we get that 'x' is approximately -6.
