Now, let's consider the indefinite integral of sin(x) again:\n\n\u222bsin(x)dx = -cos(x) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the result, we get:\n\n\u222bsin(4)dx = -cos(4) + C\n\nThe indefinite integral cannot be solved analytically for sin(4) because it involves a complex variable. However, we can approximate the result by considering the graph of sin(x) and its behavior around 4\u03c0.\n\nIf we approximate sin(4) with sin(\u03c0), then the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222bsin(\u03c0)dx = -cos(\u03c0) + C\n\nThe final answer is: -1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -1.
