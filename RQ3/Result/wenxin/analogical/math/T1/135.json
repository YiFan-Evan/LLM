Therefore, the final answer is: 4.\n\nNow, let's consider another function: sin(x)/x.\n\nThe indefinite integral of sin(x)/x is -cos(x) + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=\u03c0/4' into this result, we get -cos(\u03c0/4) + C = (\u221a2)/2 + C.

Substituting 'x=9' into this result, we get (1/2)ln(9) + C = (3/2) + C.
