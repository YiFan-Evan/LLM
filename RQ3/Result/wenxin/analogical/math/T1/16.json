Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: e^2 = 7.39474677763636\n\nNow, let's consider another function: sin(x). The indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nThe indefinite integral of sin(4) is -cos(4) + C. To find the value of C, we can use the definition of the indefinite integral and integrate sin(4) from 0 to 4 to find the value of C.\n\nTherefore, the value of C is:\n\nC = sin(4) - sin(0) = sin(4) - 0 = 0.797884091627368\n\nNow, let's consider another problem: f(x) = x^2 + 2x + 1.
