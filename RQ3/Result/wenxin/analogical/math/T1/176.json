We also need to know how to differentiate expressions to find the correct antiderivatives.\n\nQ2: What are some common integration techniques?\nA2: Some common integration techniques include substitution, integration by parts, partial fractions decomposition, and trigonometric and exponential identities. These techniques can be used to simplify and evaluate indefinite integrals.\n\nQ3: What is the significance of the constant C in the indefinite integral?\nA3: The constant C in the indefinite integral represents an arbitrary constant that is added to make the integral well-defined. It does not affect the value of the indefinite integral itself, but it does affect the value of the final result after integration and substitution."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)/(1/x)*x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8d77\uff0c\u4e4b\u524d\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u7b54\u6709\u8bef\u3002\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u6211\u91cd\u65b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570 (1+x) / (1/x) * x \u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee3\u5165 x=4 \u7684\u503c\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u3002\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u516c\u5f0f\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\u222b f(x) dx = F(x) + C\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u51fd\u6570 (1+x) / (1/x) * x\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u5206\u6bcd\u6c42\u5bfc\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5bfc\u6570\u4ee3\u5165\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u79ef\u5206\u3002\n\n(1) \u5206\u5b50\u6c42\u5bfc\uff1a\n\n(1+x)' = 1\n\n(2) \u5206\u6bcd\u6c42\u5bfc\uff1a\n\n(1/x)' = - x^-2\n\n\u5c06(1)\u548c(2)\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee3\u5165\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n\n\u222b (1+x) * x^2 * (- x^-2) dx\n\n\u7136\u540e\u6211\u4eec\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u4e0a\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u79ef\u5206\u4e86\u3002\u7ecf\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n\n\u222b x^3 dx = x^4/4 + C\n\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee3\u5165 x=4\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n\n\u222b 4^3 dx = 4^4/4 + C = 256 + C\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\uff1a256\u3002"}]
