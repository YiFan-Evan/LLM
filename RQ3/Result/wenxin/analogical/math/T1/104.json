Therefore, the answer is 2/4 + some constant.\n\nProblem 3: If I have a function y = (e^x)/ln(x) and I want to calculate its indefinite integral, what should I do?\nSolution: Substitute 'x=4' into the indefinite integral of y = (e^x)/ln(x). The indefinite integral is e^(4)/ln(4) = e^4/ln(e^4) = e^4/(e^4) = 1. Therefore, the final answer is: 1.\n\nNow we have the answer to the original question.
