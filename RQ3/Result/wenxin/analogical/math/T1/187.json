However, we can use the result of the previous step to find a closed-form expression for the indefinite integral:\n\n\u222b(x^2*sinh(x^2)) dx = x^2*cosh(x^2) - (x*sinh(x^2) + C_1) + C\n\n3.

Now, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral using a method that includes 'C_1'. The most common method is to evaluate the indefinite integral using a numerical method such as a computer program or calculator. We can approximate the result by replacing 'C_1' with a large number, such as 10^9, and evaluating the indefinite integral using a numerical method.
