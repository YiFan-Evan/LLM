The indefinite integral is:\n\n\u222b(e^x*cos(x)) = (e^x*sin(x))' = e^x*cos(x) - \u222b(sin(x)) = e^x*cos(x) - sin(x) + C\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we get:\n\n\u222b(e^4*cos(4)) = e^4*cos(4) - sin(4) + C\n\nNow, we need to solve for C to eliminate the constant term. Let's take the derivative of sin(4) and add it to our indefinite integral:\n\n\u222b(e^4*cos(4)) = e^4*cos(4) - sin(4) + (cos(4))' = e^4*cos(4) - sin(4) + 4*cos(4)\n\nTo find the value of C, we need to evaluate the right-hand side at 'x=4':\n\nC = e^4*cos(4) - sin(4) + 4*cos(4) = 7.855939922559396\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe indefinite integral of the function e^x*cos(x) evaluated at 'x=4' is: 7.

What is the indefinite integral of this function?\n\nSolution 2: To calculate the indefinite integral of (x^2+1)^3, we can use the power rule and integrate each term separately. The indefinite integral is:\n\n\u222b((x^2+1)^3) = \u222b(x^6+3x^4+3x^2+1) = (1/2)*x^7 + 3/2*x^5 + 3/2*x + C\n\nProblem 3: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^2 + 1, evaluate it at 'x=3', and provide the final result.\n\nSolution 3: To calculate the indefinite integral of x^2 + 1, we can use the derivative of the square function. The indefinite integral is:\n\n\u222b(x^2+1) = (1/3)*x^3 + C\n\nEvaluating at 'x=3', we get:\n\nC = (1/3)*(3)^3 = 9\n\nTherefore, the final result is: 9.
