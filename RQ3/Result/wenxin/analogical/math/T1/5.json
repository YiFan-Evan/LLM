Substituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get the value of the function at that point: -int_(4)cos(4)dx = -sin(4) + C. The indefinite integral can be evaluated using a calculator or computer program, but the result will depend on the method used and the specific values used for integration constants. Therefore, the final answer is: The indefinite integral of cos(x) at x=4 is -sin(4) + C.\n\nNow, let's consider another function: sin(x).\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x), we use the integration formula: -int_(x)sin(x)dx = -cos(x) + C. Substituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get the value of the function at that point: -int_(4)sin(4)dx = -cos(4) + C.
