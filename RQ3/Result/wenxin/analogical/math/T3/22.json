The indefinite integral of e^x is simply e^x.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we simply replace x with 4. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 248.\n\nNow, let's consider another function expression: sin(x) + cos(x).\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x) + cos(x), we can use the trigonometric functions' properties and formulas. The indefinite integral of sin(x) + cos(x) is (cos(x) - sin(x)) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=7\u03c0/4', we replace x with 7\u03c0/4. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -\u221a2 + 1.\n\nFinally, let's consider the function expression: x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x, we can use the power and product properties of mathematics. The indefinite integral of x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x is 3x^2 + 6x + 2 + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x= -2', we replace x with -2.
