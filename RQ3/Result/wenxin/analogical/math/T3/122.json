The indefinite integral becomes \u222b(1/u)du = ln(u) + C, where C is a constant. Substituting u = 1/x into this expression, we get ln(1/x) + C. To find the value of C, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral at x=4: ln(1/4) + C.\n\nTo find the final result, we can take the derivative of ln(1/x) with respect to x to find the expression for x=4. Then we can solve for C from that expression, which gives us C = ln(4) - ln(1/x). Substituting x=4 into this expression, we get C = ln(4) - ln(4) = 0.

The indefinite integral becomes \u222b(u+2)/u du = \u222b(u/u) + (2/u)du = lnu + ln|u| + C. Substituting u = x^2 - 4 into this expression, we get lnx^2 - 4 + ln|x^2 - 4| + C.

The indefinite integral becomes \u222bx^(3/2)/u du = \u222bx^(3/2) du = (1/3)x^(3/2) + C. Substituting u = sqrt(x) into this expression, we get (1/3)x^(3/2) + C. To find the value of C, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral at x=4: (1/3)*4^(3/2) + C.\n\nTo find the final result, we can solve for C by setting u=sqrt(4), which gives us C = (8*sqrt(pi)/3)/6 = (8*sqrt(pi)/6). Substituting x=4 into this expression, we get C = (8*sqrt(pi)/6), so the final answer is: (8*sqrt(pi)/6)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/(1/x))+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of (1/(1/x))+x, we can use the substitution u = 1/x.
