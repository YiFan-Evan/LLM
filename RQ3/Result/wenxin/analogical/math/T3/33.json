Therefore, the final answer is: 4.\n\nKunal's new task\nThe function is: x^3 + x^2 + x - 3\n\nSolution:\n\nIndefinite integral: x^3 + x^2 + x - 3 = (x^3 + x^2) + (x - 3) + C, where C is a constant. Substituting x=4 into this result gives us (4^3 + 4^2) + (4 - 3) + C = 67 + C. Therefore, the final answer is: 67.\n\nThe next problem\nThe function is: log(x) + 3x^2 - 2x^3\n\nSolution:\n\nIndefinite integral: log(x) + 3x^2 - 2x^3 = ln(x) + x*sqrt(3*x) - x^2*sqrt(2*x), where ln represents the natural logarithm. Substituting x=4 into this result gives us ln(4) + 4*sqrt(3*4) - 4^2*sqrt(8) = ln(4) + 12 - 32 = ln(4) - 16.
