To evaluate this, we need to know the values of C and D. We can use the rule that when the indefinite integral is e^x + Cx + D, the constant C is equal to 1. Therefore, the constant C = 1 and the indefinite integral becomes e^(e^4) + x. Now, to find the definite integral, we need to integrate again with respect to x. The result is e^(e^4) * (e^x)'. The derivative of e^x is e^(x) * ln(e), so the final result is e^(e^4) * (e^x) * ln(e). Therefore, the final answer rounded down to the nearest integer is 27."}]
