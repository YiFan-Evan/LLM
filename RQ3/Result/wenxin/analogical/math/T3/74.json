The indefinite integral becomes \u222b(x^2)*x dx = \u222bu*x dx with u = x^2. We can now apply the integration rule for quadratic functions: \u222bu*x dx = u*x + C. This results in the indefinite integral: u*x + C.\n\nNow, substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get: 4*4 + C. Therefore, the final answer is: 16.\n\nNow, let's consider another function: y = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 5.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of this function, we can use the substitution u = x^2 + 2x + 3. The indefinite integral becomes \u222b(x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 5) dx with u = x^2 + 2x + 3. We can now apply the integration rule for cubic functions: \u222b(u*x + C) dx = (u/2)*x^2 + C. This results in the indefinite integral: (u/2)*x^2 + Cdx.\n\nNow, substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get: (u/2)*4^2 + Cdx = (4^2/2) + C.

This results in the indefinite integral: u*y + Cdx.\n\nNow, substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get: (u/2)*4^2 + Cdx = (4^2/2)dx = 7.
