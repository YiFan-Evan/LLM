The invariant should be written in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`.\n\nHere's the invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop:\n\n* `arr[i] = insertion_sort(arr[i]->arr[i])`: This states that the `i-th` element of the array is sorted after applying the insertion sort algorithm to it.\n\nNow, let's break down the algorithm and see how this invariant is maintained:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The outer while loop starts at index `h` (which is initially set to 0).\n2. **Inner while loop**: The inner while loop starts at index `z` (which is initially set to 0). It compares the elements with each other and swaps them if necessary. This loop continues until `z` reaches 0 or there are no more elements to compare.\n3. **Invariance check**: After the inner loop finishes, we check if `arr[i]` is still in its correct position. If it is, then the invariant holds true.\n4. **Increment of h**: After each iteration, `h` is incremented by 1, which means we are moving to the next element in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe provided code for `insertion_sort` function maintains the invariant that each element in the array is sorted after applying the insertion sort algorithm to it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a`i`\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u901a\u5e38\u5728Python\u4e2d\u7528\u6765\u8868\u793a\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`i`\u5e94\u8be5\u662f`arr[i]`\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a`arr`\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5728`while z > 0`\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5199\u9519\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f`z`\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`i`\u3002\n\n\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        z = h\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        arr.insert(h, arr[h])  # \u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u76f8\u90bb\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5e94\u8be5\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5c31\u4ea4\u6362\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u6392\u597d\u5e8f\u3002\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u4f7f\u7528\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u662f\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e86\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8fd4\u56de\u8bed\u53e5\uff1a`return arr`\u3002\u8fd9\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
