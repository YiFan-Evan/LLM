Currently, it is set to `-1` and this will cause an error when trying to access `arr[m - 1]` in the inner loop.\n\nThe correct initialization of `m` should be the last element of the array, which is `len(arr) - 1`. This will ensure that the first element is always in its correct position and the inner loop can correctly find the elements to be inserted.\n\nHere is the corrected code:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    m = len(arr) - 1\n    while m > 0:\n        m -= 1\n        z = m\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr\n```\nNow, this function will correctly sort the array using insertion sort. The invariant for the i-th iteration is `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[m]`, which ensures that the elements in the sorted part of the array are in ascending order."}]
