The invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.\n\nGiven the provided program, here's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n'member_value_in_i_th_iteration = get_member_value(arr, e)'\n\nHere's the explanation for each term:\n\n* 'member_value_in_i_th_iteration' refers to the value of 'member_value' in the i-th iteration of the loop.\n* 'get_member_value(arr, e)' is a function that takes the array 'arr' and an index 'e' as inputs and returns the value at that index. This function is used to calculate the value of 'member_value' in each iteration based on the array and the current index 'e'.\n\nNow, here's how the loop invariant helps prove the partial correctness of the program:\n\n* Initially, when the loop starts, 'member_value' is set to -1 and 'e' is set to 0.\n* In each iteration, if 'e' equals 'id', then 'member_value' is updated with the value at index 'e' in the array.\n* After each iteration, 'e' is incremented by 1, ensuring that it remains within the bounds of the array.\n* The loop continues until 'e' reaches the length of the array, indicating that all elements have been checked.\n* Therefore, when the loop finishes, 'member_value_in_i_th_iteration' will hold the value of 'member_value' in the i-th iteration, which proves that the program has partially worked correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided Python program has a loop invariant that proves its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    e = -1\n    while e < len(arr) - 1:\n        e += 1\n        if e == id:\n            member_value = arr[e]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570`give_member`\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u6536\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4`arr`\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u6570`id`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u67e5\u627e\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9aID\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u5176\u503c\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u60f3\u5c06`e < len(arr) - 1`\u66f4\u6539\u4e3a`e < len(arr)`\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u662f\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5c31\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u904d\u5386\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u4e0eID\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        e += 1\n        if e == id:\n            member_value = arr[e]\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u627e\u5230\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9aID\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u5176\u503c\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9aID\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de-1\u3002"}]
