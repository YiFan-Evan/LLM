Therefore, it means that `arr[i]` is less than or equal to its sorted position.\n\nHere's the description of three related but not identical problems, along with their solutions:\n\nProblem 1: Suppose you are given an array of numbers and you want to sort them in ascending order using insertion sort. How would you go about doing it?\nSolution: You can follow the code provided in your program, except that you might want to change the `temp` variable to a more descriptive name, like `new_val`. You also might want to make sure that you start from index 1 instead of index 0 because insertion sort is designed to work on ascending order.\n\nProblem 2: Suppose you have a sorted array and you want to insert a new number into the array such that it maintains the sorted order. How would you go about doing it?\nSolution: You can use insertion sort to insert a new number into a sorted array. The process is similar to what you provided in your program, except that you would compare `new_val` with the previous number instead of comparing it with its neighbors in the sorted array.\n\nProblem 3: Suppose you have a list of numbers and you want to check if they are already sorted in ascending order. How would you go about doing it?\nSolution: You can use insertion sort to check if a list of numbers is already sorted in ascending order. You can follow the same process as provided in your program, except that you would compare `arr[i]` with `arr[i+1]` instead of comparing it with its neighbors in the sorted array. If they are equal, then the list is sorted in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion_sort function ensures that the elements in the array will be sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    f = -1\n    while f < len(arr) - 1:\n        f += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4f3c\u4e4e\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u62fc\u5199\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5982\u201ci\u201d\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u201cz\u201d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u8d4b\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u201c=\u201d\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u201c->\u201d\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u90e8\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7f29\u8fdb\u6765\u683c\u5f0f\u5316\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    f = -1\n    while f < len(arr) - 1:\n        f += 1\n        z = arr[f]\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z = arr[z - 1]  # \u8fd9\u662f\u8d4b\u503c\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e94\u8be5\u548c\u6570\u7ec4\u7d22\u5f15\u653e\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u884c\n        arr.append(z)  # \u4fee\u590d\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u884c\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u6b64\u5904\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528append\u65b9\u6cd5\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\"i\"\n    return arr\n```\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u5728`arr.append(z)`\u4e4b\u540e\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5b83\u5c06\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u7ec4\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u8bf7\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u5b8c\u6574\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6392\u5e8f\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e9b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}]
