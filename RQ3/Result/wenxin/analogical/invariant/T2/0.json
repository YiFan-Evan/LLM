It is initialized to the first element of the array, which may not be the largest element. The while loop then iterates through the rest of the array, checking each element against `max_value`. If an element is found to be greater than `max_value`, then `max_value` is updated to that element. The loop continues until all elements in the array have been checked.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the provided program is: `max_value = find_max(arr[i])`.
