I'm not quite sure what you mean by \"the i-th iteration of the loop\" because your code is already written in a loop.\n\nIf you want to provide a loop invariant for this code, it would be:\n\n\"The minimum value in the array remains unchanged during the process of selection sort.\"\n\nThis invariant follows from the fact that the inner while loop keeps moving up through the array, picking the minimum value at each step, and swapping it with the first element (i.e., kth element). Therefore, as long as the algorithm is running, the minimum value will always be at position k.\n\nThe final answer is: Your code is correct and implements selection sort correctly.
