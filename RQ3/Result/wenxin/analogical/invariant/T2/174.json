At the start of the outer loop, `arr[i]` is the element to be inserted into the sorted part of the array.\n2. The inner loop checks if `arr[i]` is greater than the element before it (`arr[z - 1]`). If it is, it swaps `arr[i]` with `arr[z]` and moves `arr[z - 1]` one position ahead. This ensures that `arr[i]` is always smaller than or equal to the element before it.\n3. After the inner loop finishes, `arr[i]` is now smaller than or equal to all elements before it, so it can be inserted into the sorted part of the array without violating the invariant.\n4. The outer loop then moves `i` one position ahead, and the process repeats for the next element in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant proves that the insertion sort algorithm maintains the sorted order of the elements in the array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = -1\n    while o < len(arr) - 1:\n        o += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2awhile\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`i`\u548c`o`\u90fd\u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u4e49`i`\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = 0\n    i = 1\n    while o < len(arr) - 1:\n        while i <= o:\n            if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:\n                arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]\n            i += 1\n        o += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5728\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8be5\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u8be5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002\u5b83\u91cd\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0cPython\u7684\u5217\u8868\u7d22\u5f15\u662f\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u5728\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u662f`arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`\u3002\u5426\u5219\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u9519\u8fc7\u4e00\u4e9b\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002"}]
