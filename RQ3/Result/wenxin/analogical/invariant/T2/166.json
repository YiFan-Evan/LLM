Now let's talk about the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the insertion sort function defined above.\n\nLoop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n```\narr[i-1] <= arr[i]\n```\nThis invariant states that after the i-th element is inserted into the sorted array, it satisfies the requirement that the elements before i-1 are already sorted and the element at index i-1 is less than or equal to the element at index i. This ensures that the entire array remains sorted after each iteration of the loop.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Start with an unsorted array `arr` of size `n`.\n2. Initialize `g` to 0, which represents the current index in the sorted array.\n3. Iterate through the outer loop while `g` is less than the length of the array `arr`.\n4. Inside the outer loop, initialize `z` to `i` (the current index) and start a nested loop while `z` is greater than 0 and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`.\n5. Inside the nested loop, swap `arr[z]` and `arr[z - 1]` if they are in the wrong order. This ensures that `arr[i-1] <= arr[i]` is maintained after each iteration of the nested loop.\n6. After each iteration of the nested loop, increment `g` by 1 to move to the next element in the sorted array.\n7. After completing all iterations of the outer loop, return the sorted array `arr`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The insertion sort algorithm presented above ensures that the entire array remains sorted after each iteration of the loop, maintaining the invariant `arr[i-1] <= arr[i]`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = -1\n    while g < len(arr) - 1:\n        g += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u7ea0\u6b63\u4e00\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = 0\n    while g < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = g + 1\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        g += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\uff1a\n\n* \u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u8d4b\u503c\u8bed\u53e5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u6765\u66ff\u6362`i`\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684`i`\u88ab\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a`z`\u3002\n* `while z > 0`\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\u662f\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\u53ea\u8981`z`\u5927\u4e8e0\u5c31\u7ee7\u7eed\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u6211\u4eec\u5e0c\u671b\u5728\u627e\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u540e\u9000\u51fa\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u6761\u4ef6\u5e94\u8be5\u662f`arr[z - 1] <= arr[z]`\u3002\n* \u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`i`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u91cc\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528`z`\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0a\u5c31\u662f\u5bf9\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u5efa\u8bae\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u4e86\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bf7\u968f\u65f6\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff01"}]
