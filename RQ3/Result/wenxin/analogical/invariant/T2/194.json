Initially, `arr[i]` is the i-th element of the array, so `arr[i] = arr[i]` holds true.\n2. Inside the inner loop, if `arr[z]` is less than `arr[o]`, then it means that `arr[z]` is a potential replacement for `arr[o]` in the sorted array. Therefore, `arr[z]` is already sorted, so `arr[z] = selection_sort(arr[:z])[z]` holds true.\n3. After swapping `arr[o]` and `arr[z]`, `arr[o]` is now in its correct position in the sorted array, so `arr[o] = selection_sort(arr[:o])[o]` holds true.\n4. Since the inner loop is only checking the i-th element (inclusive) to the end of the array (exclusive), it means that `arr[i]` is still in its correct position in the sorted array after the inner loop. Therefore, `arr[i] = selection_sort(arr[:i])[i]` still holds true after each iteration of the inner loop.\n\nThis loop invariant ensures that at each iteration of the outer loop, `arr[i]` is still in its correct position in the sorted array, which proves that the program is partially correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    o = -1\n    while o < len(arr) - 1:\n        o += 1\n        z = o + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[o]:\n                temp = arr[o]\n                arr[o] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u5199\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4f60\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6761\u4ef6`while z < len(arr)`\uff0c\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6761\u4ef6`z < len(arr) - 1`\u4e4b\u524d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f60\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d1f\u6570\u3002\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i + 1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = temp\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u627e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u6392\u5e8f\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20i\uff08\u4ece0\u5230n-1\uff09\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u68c0\u67e5\u6240\u6709\u5927\u4e8ei\u7684\u5143\u7d20j\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bd4i\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c31\u4ea4\u6362\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u68c0\u67e5\u5b8c\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c31\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u4e5f\u53ef\u4ee5\u7528\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}]
