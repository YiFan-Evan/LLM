Initially, `a` is 0 and `arr[a]` is the first element of the array.\n2. In the first while loop, `z` is incremented until it reaches the end of the array. If `arr[z]` is smaller than `arr[a]`, it means that we have found a smaller element after `arr[a]`.\n3. Then, `arr[a]` is swapped with `arr[z]`, making sure that `arr[a]` is now the smallest element in its current position.\n4. After this swap, `a` is incremented, and the process repeats for the next iteration.\n\nSo, as long as this loop invariant holds true, the selection sort algorithm will always make progress towards finding the smallest element in each position. It also means that `arr[a]` is guaranteed to be the smallest element of its current position, because if it wasn't, we would have found it earlier and swapped it with something smaller."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    a = -1\n    while a < len(arr) - 1:\n        a += 1\n        z = a + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[a]:\n                temp = arr[a]\n                arr[a] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u975e\u5e38\u597d\uff0c\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u56de\u7b54\u4e86\u6211\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684Python\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5de5\u4f5c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u65ad\u7684\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u662f\uff1a\n\n`arr[a] <= arr[a+1] <= ... <= arr[z-1] < arr[z]`\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c`arr[a]` \u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u5e76\u79fb\u9664\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f1a\u4f7f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a**\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f**\u3002"}]
