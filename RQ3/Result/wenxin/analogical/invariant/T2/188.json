The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is: `arr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i+1])`. The invariant for the inner loop is: `arr[i] < arr[j] for all j from i+1 to len(arr)`.\n\nHowever, the provided code has a problem: it does not handle the case where the array is already sorted. It will keep moving elements around in an infinite loop if the array is already sorted.\n\nHere's a corrected version of the code that handles this case:\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    i = 0\n    while i < n - 1:\n        if arr[i] > arr[i+1]:\n            j = i + 1\n            while arr[j] < arr[i]:\n                arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]\n                j += 1\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    return arr\n```\nIn this corrected version, if the array is already sorted, the outer loop will continue to move to the next element in the array, so that it will not get stuck in an infinite loop."}]
