If `arr[p]` is less than `min_value_i`, we update `min_value_i` to be `arr[p]`.\n* The invariant holds because each iteration finds the minimum value within the current subarray `arr[i:i+1]` and updates `min_value_i` accordingly. Therefore, at the end of the loop, `min_value` will contain the minimum value in the entire array `arr`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the provided program is `min_value_i = find_min(arr[i:i+1])`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    p = -1\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        p += 1\n        if arr[p] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[p]\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570`find_min(arr)`\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4`arr`\u4e2d\u67e5\u627e\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u903b\u8f91\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u51fa\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5e2e\u52a9\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u8bf7\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u5c3d\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002"}]
