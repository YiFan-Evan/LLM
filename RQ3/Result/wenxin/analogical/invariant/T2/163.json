The invariant should be written in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`.\n\nThe invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop is:\n\n`d_value = (len(arr) - d - 1) + d * 2`\n\n* The outer while loop starts from index `d`, and so its initial value for `d_value` is `(len(arr) - d - 1)`.\n* Then, in each iteration, `d` is incremented by 1, so `d_value` is updated by multiplying it by 2 (`d * 2`).\n\nThis invariant ensures that:\n\n1. The elements in the array are sorted in ascending order.\n2. The index `d` is always within the valid array indices.\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1. At the start of each iteration, `d_value` is initialized to the number of elements that have been processed so far (i.e., `len(arr) - d - 1`). This number is equal to the number of elements that will be sorted by this iteration (assuming they are already in ascending order).\n2. During each iteration, we keep moving up through the array, comparing each element with its predecessor and swapping them if necessary. Therefore, `d_value` is incremented by multiplying it by 2 each time, so that it eventually becomes equal to the total number of elements in the array (i.e., `len(arr)`).\n3. When `d_value` becomes equal to `len(arr)` (i.e., when all elements have been processed), the outer while loop will end, and the function will return the sorted array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe `insertion_sort` function provides a valid and correct solution to sorting an array using insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = -1\n    while d < len(arr) - 1:\n        d += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6211\u5c06\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e3a\u4f60\u4fee\u590d\u5b83\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        d = i\n        while d > 0 and arr[d - 1] > arr[d]:\n            temp = arr[d]\n            arr[d] = arr[d - 1]\n            arr[d - 1] = temp\n            d -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u4e0e\u4f60\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u6539\u53d8\u662f\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53d8\u91cf`d`\uff0c\u5e76\u5220\u9664\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`z`\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u65ad\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u597d\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u5f00\u59cb\u5411\u524d\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u540e\u7eed\u5143\u7d20\u59cb\u7ec8\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002"}]
