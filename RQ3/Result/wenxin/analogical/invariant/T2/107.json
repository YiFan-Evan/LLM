The loop invariant should be written in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`.\n\nHere's an example loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the `give_member` function:\n\n**Loop invariant for iteration i**: `arr[id]` contains the value of the member at index `id` in the array `arr`.\n\nTo prove this invariant holds throughout the loop, we can consider a couple of cases:\n\n* **Initialization**: Before the first iteration, we know that `member_value` is initially set to -1, so the invariant is initially true.\n* **Termination**: At the end of each iteration, we increment `h` by 1 and check if it equals `id`. If it does, we set `member_value` to the value at index `id` in `arr`, thus maintaining the invariant.\n* **Commutativity**: Since `h += 1` moves forward through the array, and we compare `h` with `id`, we can ensure that we never go backward through the array and violate the invariant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the `give_member` function."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        if h == id:\n            member_value = arr[h]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5b83\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee3\u7801\u65e0\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u4f60\u5728`while`\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u5224\u65ad\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`len(arr) - 1`\uff0c\u800c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u60f3\u8981\u68c0\u67e5\u7d22\u5f15\u662f\u5426\u7b49\u4e8e`id`\u3002\u4fee\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    h = -1\n    while h < id:  # \u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u5224\u65ad\n        h += 1\n        if h == id:\n            member_value = arr[h]\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4`arr`\uff0c\u67e5\u627e\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a`id`\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u503c\u8d4b\u7ed9`member_value`\u3002\u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u8be5\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5219\u8fd4\u56de\u5176\u503c\uff1b\u5426\u5219\u8fd4\u56de-1\u6216\u5176\u4ed6\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u904d\u5386\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u8d8a\u754c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002"}]
