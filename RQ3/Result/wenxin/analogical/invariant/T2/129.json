However, there is no loop invariant specified in the program, which makes it difficult to prove its partial correctness.\n\nThe invariant that should be provided for the i-th iteration of the loop in the program should state that at any point during the loop, the `mid_value` variable is the midpoint value of the array.\n\nFor example, you can provide the following invariant:\n\n`mid_value_value = fun(arr[j:j+len(arr)//2])`\n\nThis invariant ensures that at any point during the loop, `mid_value` is the midpoint value of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe provided program is partially correct and will return the midpoint value of the array if it is provided with a valid array.
