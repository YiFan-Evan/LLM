Let's assume that the invariant for the `i`-th iteration is `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[j]`. This invariant holds before any elements are swapped within the inner loop.\n\nIn each iteration of the outer loop, the current element `arr[i]` is swapped with the first element `arr[j]` greater than it, which maintains the invariant `arr[i] <= arr[j]`. This process continues until no further swaps are needed. Therefore, we can conclude that after each iteration of the outer loop, the array is sorted from `i` to `j`.\n\nHere's an example Python code snippet showing how to use the loop invariant:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort_invariant(arr, i):\n    j = i\n    while j >= 0 and arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:\n        temp = arr[j + 1]\n        arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n        arr[j] = temp\n        j -= 1\n    return j\n\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(arr):\n        invariant = insertion_sort_invariant(arr, j)\n        print(f\"Invariant after iteration {j}: {arr}\")\n        j += 1\n    return arr\n```\nWhen you run this code, you will see that after each iteration of the outer loop, the array remains sorted from `i` to `j`, which proves that the loop invariant is correct."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        j += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5728 `while` \u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf `i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662f `j` \u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u800c\u6392\u5e8f\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4ece\u5de6\u5230\u53f3\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64 `j` \u7684\u521d\u59cb\u503c\u5e94\u4e3a 0\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        temp = arr[j]\n        k = j - 1\n        while k >= 0 and arr[k] > temp:\n            arr[k + 1] = arr[k]\n            k -= 1\n        arr[k + 1] = temp\n        j += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\uff1a\u5b83\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u5176\u5e94\u8be5\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u518d\u79fb\u52a8\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5927\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u91cd\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u5df2\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u3002"}]
