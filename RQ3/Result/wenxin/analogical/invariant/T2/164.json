The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Let's assume that the invariant for the `i`-th iteration is `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[e]` for some value of `e`.\n\nNow, we can prove that this invariant holds for each iteration by considering the steps taken in the function.\n\nIn the first while loop, we are iterating through the array from `i` to `e`. If `arr[i] > arr[j]` for any `j` greater than `i`, then it would violate the invariant for the current iteration. Therefore, we can conclude that `arr[i] <= arr[j]` for all `j` greater than `i`.\n\nIn the second while loop, we are moving elements in the array until we find an element that is greater than or equal to `arr[i]`. This ensures that `arr[i] <= arr[z] <= arr[z+1] <= ... <= arr[e]` for all iterations.\n\nFinally, in the outer loop, we are incrementing `e` by 1, which means that the next iteration will start from `e+1` and not from `i`. Therefore, we can conclude that the invariant holds for each iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the `insertion_sort` function."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = -1\n    while e < len(arr) - 1:\n        e += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`i`\u548c`arr`\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u8d4b\u503c\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf`arr[i]`\u7528\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6392\u5e8f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f8b\u5b50\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        e = i + 1\n        while e > 0 and arr[e - 1] > arr[e]:\n            temp = arr[e - 1]\n            arr[e - 1] = arr[i]\n            arr[i] = temp\n            e -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u4ee3\u8868\u5f53\u524d\u9700\u8981\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c`e`\u5219\u8868\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5927\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c31\u4ea4\u6362\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06`e`\u5411\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u53d8\u5f97\u6709\u5e8f\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
