[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Then, this sum is added to the global `sum_value` variable.

This is done by recursively calling `give_sum` with the remaining elements in the subarray. Since the subarrays are disjoint, the final `sum_value` will be the sum of all elements in the original array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The program is partially correct and correctly calculates the sum of all elements in the given array, but it assumes that all subarrays are disjoint, which may not be true in general."}]
