The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.\n\nThe provided program `give_member(arr, id)` seems to be a function that searches for a specific member in an array `arr` based on its ID `id`. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be:\n\n`member_value_n = fun(arr[n]->arr[n])`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the value of `member_value` is updated correctly during each iteration of the loop. It ensures that `member_value` is initialized to -1 at the start of the loop, and then updated to the value of `arr[n]` for each iteration where `n` is equal to the ID `id`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe provided program `give_member(arr, id)` fulfills the described requirements and has a loop invariant that proves its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        if n == id:\n            member_value = arr[n]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd4\u56de\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8fd4\u56de\u627e\u5230\u7684\u6210\u5458\u7684\u503c\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u73b0\u5728\u53ea\u80fd\u627e\u5230\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6210\u5458\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        if n == id:\n            member_value = arr[n]\n        elif n == len(arr) - 1:  # \u5982\u679c\u5df2\u7ecf\u904d\u5386\u5b8c\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de-1\n            member_value = -1\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u627e\u5230\u7684\u6210\u5458\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6210\u5458\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de-1\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b83\u5141\u8bb8\u51fd\u6570\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u91cd\u590dID\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5230\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u904d\u5386\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}]
