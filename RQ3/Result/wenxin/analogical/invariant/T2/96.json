The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`last_value_i = fun(arr[i]->arr[i+1])`\n\nThis invariant ensures that at each iteration, the value of `last_value` is updated by the next element in the array, which is `arr[i]` for the current index `i`. The loop then iterates until it reaches the end of the array, `q` increasing by one with each iteration.
