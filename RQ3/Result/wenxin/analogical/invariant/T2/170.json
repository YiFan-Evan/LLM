It also indicates that the remaining elements in the array are already sorted, which is necessary for insertion sort to work correctly.\n\nHere's a more detailed explanation of the invariant:\n\n* Initially, the i-th element of the array is at its correct position.\n* In each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop performs a search to find the correct position for the i-th element within the remaining sorted array (arr[i:]).\n* If the i-th element is smaller than the element immediately before it in this sorted subarray, it can be inserted at its correct position using insertion sort.\n* After each iteration of the inner loop, the i-th element is moved to its correct position within the entire array using the outer loop.\n* The invariant ensures that each iteration of the outer loop moves the i-th element to its correct position within the entire array using insertion sort.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = -1\n    while k < len(arr) - 1:\n        k += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728`while`\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f60\u5199\u9519\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u3002\u4f60\u5728\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`k`\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f60\u53c8\u5199\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a`i`\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u5019\u90fd\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u3002\u6211\u5c06\u4fee\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\n\n\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = -1\n    while k < len(arr) - 1:\n        temp = arr[k]\n        k += 1\n        j = k - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > temp:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = temp\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u5e94\u8be5\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u8be5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u53ca\u5176\u524d\u9762\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u5df2\u6b63\u786e\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e9b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b83\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u4f60\u671f\u671b\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}]
