In the first iteration, `arr[i] <= arr[i+1]` holds true by definition.\n2. In the inner while loop, we move `arr[z]` to its correct position if it is greater than the element before it (`arr[z - 1]`). This ensures that `arr[z - 1] <= arr[z]` holds true.\n3. After each iteration, `n` is incremented by 1, which means that we have processed one more element in the array. Therefore, the invariant `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[n-1]` holds true for the next iteration as well.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        n -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf `i` \u7684\u65f6\u5019\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u53d8\u91cf `n`\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4ece `z - 1` \u5f00\u59cb\u6bd4\u8f83\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u79fb\u52a8\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e0e\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u662f\u4e00\u6837\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u3002"}]
