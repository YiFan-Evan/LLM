In the inner while loop, we move elements to the right position if they are greater than their neighbors. This ensures that arr[i] is never greater than its neighbors after each iteration.\n2. The outer while loop ensures that the algorithm iterates over all elements in the array. Therefore, arr[i+1] will be compared with arr[i] after each iteration of the inner loop, and arr[i+2], arr[i+3], etc., will be compared with arr[i+1] after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm is `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[g]`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = len(arr)\n    while g > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        g -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u521d\u59cb\u5316`i`\u4e3a1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u6765\u8868\u793a\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u5982\u4f55\u4fee\u6b63\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    i = 1\n    while i < n:\n        j = i\n        while j > 0 and arr[j - 1] > arr[j]:\n            arr[j], arr[j - 1] = arr[j - 1], arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`j`\u53ef\u80fd\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e60\u60ef\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06`i`\u548c`j`\u5206\u522b\u547d\u540d\u4e3a`current_index`\u548c`previous_index`\u3002"}]
