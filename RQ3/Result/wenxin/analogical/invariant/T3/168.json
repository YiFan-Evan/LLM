Now, I will prove the partial correctness of the provided Python program by providing a loop invariant for each iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i-1] <= arr[i-2] <= ... <= arr[0]`\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. Initially, the invariant holds because the program starts with arr[i] = i.\n2. In the inner while loop, we move the elements in the array so that they are in ascending order. This means that for any i > j, arr[i] <= arr[j].\n3. Therefore, the loop invariant holds for the next iteration as well.\n\nWe can conclude that this loop invariant proves that the provided Python program does perform insertion sort correctly, which sorts an array in ascending order using the insertion technique."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        i -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u5c06`i`\u51cf1\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u51cf1\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u5f53\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\uff0c`i`\u4f1a\u56de\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = len(arr) - 1\n    while i > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z >= 0 and arr[z] > arr[z - 1]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u63d2\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u5f00\u59cb\u67e5\u627e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u66f4\u6539\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e3a`z >= 0`\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u65b0\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u603b\u662f\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6837\u4fee\u6539\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5c31\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e86\u3002"}]
