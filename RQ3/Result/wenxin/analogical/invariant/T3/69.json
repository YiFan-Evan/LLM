The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.\n\nGiven the provided code, here's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n'arr[j-1] == arr[j]'\n\nThis invariant states that the element at index j-1 in the array is equal to the element at index j in the array. This is because in each iteration of the loop, the element at index j is checked against the target value. If it matches, then the value of id_value is updated to j, which means that j-1 and j represent the same element in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe provided Python program code fulfills the stated purpose of finding the index of a target element in a given array and updating the id_value accordingly.
