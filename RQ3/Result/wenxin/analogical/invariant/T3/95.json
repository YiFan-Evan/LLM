[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

Note that in this program, the method of getting the first element by considering only the last element and ignoring all intermediate elements may seem a bit unusual. It might be more conventional to iterate from the first element to get the first value in the array. However, this program does achieve its intended purpose."}]
