Initially, `arr[i]` is the element we are currently considering for insertion.\n2. The inner while loop iterates until `z` reaches `c-1`, where `c` is the current index of `arr`.\n3. Inside the inner loop, we compare `arr[z]` with `arr[z - 1]`. If `arr[z]` is greater than `arr[z - 1]`, we swap them and decrease `z`. This ensures that `arr[i]` is always smaller than or equal to the elements to its right.\n4. After each iteration of the inner loop, `arr[i]` becomes equal to the smallest element larger than itself, up to and including the last element of the array (`arr[c-1]`). Therefore, it can only be inserted at its correct position after the loop.\n5. Finally, once we have exited both loops, the elements in the array will be sorted in ascending order.\n\nSo, for each iteration of the outer loop, the invariant ensures that the array remains sorted until we move to the next element."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    c = len(arr)\n    while c > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        c -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u60a8\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u540d\u79f0\u5e94\u8be5\u7528\u5927\u5199\u5b57\u6bcd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u5e94\u8be5\u7528\u5c0f\u5199\u5b57\u6bcd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u60a8\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`i`\u548c`j`\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728Python\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4f5c\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u5047\u8bbe\u60a8\u60f3\u8981\u4f7f\u7528`i`\u548c`j`\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u5728\u793a\u4f8b\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u66f4\u6539\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u8ba9\u6211\u7ed9\u60a8\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    c = len(arr)\n    while c > 1:\n        j = 1\n        while j < c and arr[j - 1] > arr[j]:\n            temp = arr[j]\n            arr[j] = arr[j - 1]\n            arr[j - 1] = temp\n            j += 1\n        c -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`j`\u6765\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u79fb\u52a8`j`\u6765\u627e\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u6211\u4eec\u6bcf\u6b21\u79fb\u52a8\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\u90fd\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c0f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6`c`\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u88ab\u5b8c\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u6211\u8fd8\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7684\u6ce8\u91ca\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u3002\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e86\u3002"}]
