[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

It proves that the program partially corrects by ensuring that it correctly finds the value of the member at each iteration of the loop.\n\nHere's a description of three related but not identical problems, along with their solutions:\n\nProblem 1: Suppose you want to calculate the sum of all elements in the array. How would you modify the program to do that?\nSolution: You can modify the program by adding a line at the end of the loop that adds up all the values found in the array.\n\nProblem 2: Suppose you want to find the minimum value in the array. How would you modify the program to do that?\nSolution: You can modify the program by changing the condition of the while loop to check for the minimum value instead of checking for a specific index.\n\nProblem 3: Suppose you want to find the maximum value in the array. How would you modify the program to do that?\nSolution: You can modify the program by changing the condition of the while loop to check for the maximum value instead of checking for a specific index.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for this program ensures that it correctly finds and assigns the value of the member at each iteration of the loop.
