Here's the invariant for the `i`th iteration:\n\n\n```less\ninvariant: last_value_i = fun(arr[0]->arr[n_i])\n```\nThis invariant states that the value of `last_value` after the `i`th iteration of the loop is equal to the result of applying the function `fun` to the value at index `0` followed by the value at index `n_i` in the array `arr`.\n\nNow, let's consider the code and try to verify this invariant for each iteration:\n\n1. **Iteration 1**:\n\n\n\t* Start with an empty array `arr = []`.\n\t* Set `n = 0`, indicating the start of the loop.\n\t* Inside the loop, first set `last_value` to the first element of the array `arr[0]`.\n\t* Since there is only one element in the array, `n_i = 0`.\n\t* Therefore, for this iteration, `last_value_i = fun(arr[0]->arr[n_i]) = fun(arr[0]->arr[0])`.\n2. **Iteration 2 and subsequent iterations**:\n\n\n\t* Iterate over the remaining elements in the array, increasing `n` by 1 each iteration.\n\t* Inside the loop, update `last_value` with the current element in the array.\n\t* Since there are still elements remaining in the array, `n_i < len(arr)` is still true.\n\t* Therefore, for each subsequent iteration, `last_value_i = fun(arr[0]->arr[n_i]) = fun(arr[last_value_i]->arr[n_i+1]) = fun(last_value_i+1->arr[n_i+1])`.\n\nThe invariant holds for all iterations because it tracks the value of `last_value` as it moves through the loop, applying the function to each pair of consecutive elements in the array.
