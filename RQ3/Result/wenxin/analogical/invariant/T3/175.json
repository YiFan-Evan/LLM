Here is a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n\n```python\narr_sorted_until_p = arr[:p]\n```\nThe invariant ensures that before the start of the i-th iteration, the elements of the array up to position p are already sorted. This is because the algorithm only operates on elements at or after position p, so the earlier elements are unchanged.\n\nHere's a more formal proof:\n\n* Initially, `arr` is an unsorted array.\n* At the start of the first iteration, `p` is set to 0, so `arr[:p]` is the first unsorted subarray.\n* During the first iteration, the algorithm processes elements in order until it reaches `arr[p]`, which is the smallest element remaining in the unsorted subarray.\n* Therefore, after the first iteration, `arr[p:]` is a sorted subarray, which is exactly `arr_sorted_until_p`.\n* Repeat this process for each subsequent iteration, and you can prove that after each iteration, `arr_sorted_until_p` is a sorted subarray of `arr`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The invariant ensures that each iteration of the loop maintains the sorted property of the array up to position p."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = len(arr)\n    while p > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        p -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u5c06\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4ece\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u53d6\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\uff1a\n\n1. `i` \u548c `j` \u53d8\u91cf\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\n2. `arr[z - 1] = temp` \u8fd9\u4e00\u884c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u5728 `arr[z] = arr[z - 1]` \u4e4b\u540e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f60\u5728\u8fd9\u4e00\u884c\u6539\u53d8\u4e86 `arr[z]` \u7684\u503c\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff08\u5373\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a 1\uff09\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u5408\u9002\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662f O(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d n \u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}]
