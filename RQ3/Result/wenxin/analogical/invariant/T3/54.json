[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

If it matches, the count value is incremented by one. If it doesn't match, the index is incremented and the invariant is checked again.\n3. **Loop Exit Condition**: The loop exits when the end of the array is reached.\n4. **Invariant Verification**: At the end of each iteration, the count value is updated based on the invariant.
