It starts with an element `arr[i]` and then compares it with the elements to its right. If it is greater than any of these elements, it is moved to the correct position by swapping with the greater element. This process continues until `arr[i]` is less than or equal to all elements to its right, proving that it has been inserted correctly into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.\n\nThe invariant `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[b]` also proves that the sorted part of the array contains at least i elements.
