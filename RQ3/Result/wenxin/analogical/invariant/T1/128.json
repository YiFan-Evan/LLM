It iterates through the list until it finds the middle element. The invariant you should prove for each iteration is `mid_value = fun(arr[i])`, where `fun(x)` represents some operation you've chosen to perform on the number `x`.\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration is:\n\n\n```less\nmid_value_value = fun(arr[mid_value]->arr[i])\n```\nTo prove this invariant, you need to show that this condition holds true for each iteration, starting from the first, until the algorithm finds the median. You'll need to provide evidence for each step showing that `mid_value` has been updated according to your `fun` function.\n\nHere's an example of how you might do that:\n\n\n```less\nProof:\n1. Initially, i = 0 and mid_value = arr[0] = arr[mid_value]\n2. At the first iteration, i = 1 and mid_value = arr[1] = arr[mid_value]\n3. At the second iteration, i = 2 and mid_value = arr[2] = arr[mid_value]\n...\nn-2. At the (n-2)th iteration, i = (n-2) and mid_value = arr[(n-2)] = arr[mid_value]\nn-1. At the last iteration, i = (n-1)/2 and mid_value = arr[(n-1)/2] is the median value\n```\nThis shows that `mid_value` has always been updated correctly, so the invariant holds true for each iteration.
