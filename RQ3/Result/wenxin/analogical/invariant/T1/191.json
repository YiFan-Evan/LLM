If `arr[z]` is found to be less than `arr[l]`, then `arr[l]` is moved to its correct position, and `arr[z]` is moved to the end of the sorted part.\n* The invariant is maintained by ensuring that `arr[l]` is always less than or equal to `arr[l+1]`, which is further checked against `arr[i]` to ensure that the sorted part is increasing.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided code for selection sort maintains the loop invariant stated above, which proves its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = l + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[l]:\n                temp = arr[l]\n                arr[l] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u5168\u6b63\u786e\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u4ece\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5b58\u653e\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5168\u90e8\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5143\u7d20\u6392\u5b8c\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u662f\uff1a`arr[l] <= arr[l+1] <= ... <= arr[i]`\uff0c\u8fd9\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c`arr[l]` \u662f\u5f53\u524d\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u6267\u884c\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}]
