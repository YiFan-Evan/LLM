Here's an invariant for the `i-th` iteration:\n\n\n```python\narr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i])\n```\nLet's rewrite the loop to use this invariant:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr):\n        invariant = arr[h]\n        z = h\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > invariant:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        arr[h] = fun(arr[h]->arr[invariant])\n        h += 1\n    return arr\n```\nIn the `i-th` iteration, we insert the value `arr[i]` into the sorted part of the array using `fun(arr[i]->arr[invariant])`. The invariant ensures that `invariant` is a value that is smaller than all values to its left in the array. Therefore, `fun(arr[i]->arr[invariant])` is safe to insert as the value will always be smaller than its predecessor in the sorted part of the array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u6765\u63cf\u8ff0\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u7528\u9014\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u6765\u5f15\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u3002\n\n\u6211\u5c06\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = h\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u6267\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u90fd\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u76f8\u90bb\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u4ea4\u6362\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002"}]
