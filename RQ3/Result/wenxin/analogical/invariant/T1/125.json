The loop invariant ensures that we are always selecting the middle element of the list, which is the median.\n\nProblem 2:\nGiven a list of strings, find the middle character of each string.\n\nSolution:\nTo find the middle character of each string, we can use the provided program. The loop invariant ensures that we are always selecting the middle character of each string.\n\nProblem 3:\nGiven a list of numbers, find the mean of the list.\n\nSolution:\nTo find the mean of a list, we can use the provided program by excluding the loop.
