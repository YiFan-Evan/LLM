The outer while loop iterates over the array from `h` to the end.\n2. The inner while loop iterates from `z` to the end of the array and compares each element with the first element (`h`). If it finds a smaller element, it swaps them. This moves the smaller element to its correct position, and if necessary, adjusts the first element `h` position accordingly.\n3. At the end of each outer loop iteration, the array has been sorted to its correct order at index `i`. Therefore, the sorted array will have `i` elements correctly ordered at any given point of time.\n\nSo, if we start with an unsorted array, at each iteration `i`, the array will be in sorted order at `i`. Hence, we have proved that this loop invariant holds for the selection sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = h + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[h]:\n                temp = arr[h]\n                arr[h] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u5c06`h`\u589e\u52a01\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u5426\u5219\uff0c\u5f53\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u904d\u5386\u5b8c\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u540e\uff0c`h`\u4f1a\u8d85\u51fa\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr):\n        z = h + 1\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z] < arr[h]:\n            temp = arr[h]\n            arr[h] = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5f53\u8f93\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u6309\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ea\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u672c\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0d\u662f\u6700\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u5f52\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\u6216\u5feb\u901f\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
