It maintains a sorted subarray while inserting elements from the end of the array into this sorted subarray.\n\nThe invariant you provided is correct, but it assumes that the array is already sorted in the opposite direction (descending order). If you want to prove the partial correctness of the insertion sort function for ascending order, you need to provide a different invariant.\n\nHere's an invariant for the `i`th iteration of the insertion sort function for ascending order:\n\n`arr[i] <= fun(arr[i+1]->arr[i])`\n\nThis invariant states that after the `i`th iteration, the `i`th element of the array is still smaller than or equal to the element that will be inserted into the sorted subarray.\n\nHere's an example of how this invariant could be used to prove the partial correctness of the insertion sort function for ascending order:\n\n1. **Problem 1**: Assume that we have an array `arr = [2, 5, 6, 1, 3]`. After the first iteration of the loop, we would have `arr = [1, 2, 5, 6, 3]`. The first element `arr[0]` is still smaller than or equal to the element `arr[i+1]` that will be inserted into the sorted subarray.\n2. **Problem 2**: Now assume that we have an array `arr = [6, 5, 4, 3, 2]`.

Therefore, the insertion sort function is partially correct for ascending order.\n\nNow that we have established that the insertion sort function is partially correct for ascending order, let's consider what happens when you apply it to an array that violates this invariant. If you try to apply insertion sort to an array that violates this invariant (e.g., if you try to sort a descending array), it will not work correctly. In this case, you would need to use a different sorting algorithm (e.g., merge sort or quick sort) that is designed for sorting arrays in descending order."}]
