Now that you have provided the loop invariant in the correct format, I can provide a more detailed explanation of the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\nFor the i-th iteration of the loop, we can say that \"arr[i] is the smallest element in the sorted subarray arr[i+1:]\". That is, after the i-th iteration of the loop, the element arr[i] will be moved to its correct position in the sorted subarray arr[i+1:], which ensures that arr[i] is now the smallest element in its sorted subarray.\n\nHere's the loop invariant in the form you requested:\n\n`arr[i]_is_the_smallest_element_in_the_sorted_subarray_arr[i+1:]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the algorithm maintains a sorted subarray at each position i during the loop, so it is partially correct and sufficient to prove the correctness of this program."}]
