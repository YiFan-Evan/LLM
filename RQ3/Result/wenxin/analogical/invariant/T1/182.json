Therefore, `arr[i]` is the smallest element remaining in the unsorted part of the array.\n\nIn other words, this invariant ensures that each element in the current iteration is either the smallest remaining element or greater than all elements in the unsorted part of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the selection sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = c + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[c]:\n                temp = arr[c]\n                arr[c] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        c += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5957\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee5\u4e0b\u8bed\u53e5\uff1a\n\n\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\uff1a\n\n* `arr[c]` \u662f\u5f53\u524d\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\uff1a\n\n* `arr[c]` \u4fdd\u6301\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u6761\u4ef6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002"}]
