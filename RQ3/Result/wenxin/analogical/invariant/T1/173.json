The invariant should be written in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`.\n\nHere's an invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop:\n\n* `arr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i])`: This invariant states that the value of `arr[i]` after the loop is equal to the result of applying the insertion sort function to `arr[i]`.\n\nNow, let's break down the loop and explain how this invariant is maintained:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The outer while loop starts with `n = 0`. This is the index of the first element to be sorted.\n2. **Inner Loop**: The inner while loop iterates over the elements `arr[i]` to `arr[n]` and compares them with `arr[z - 1]`. If `arr[z]` is greater than `arr[z - 1]`, it swaps them and decrements `z`. This process continues until `z` reaches 0 or an element that is not greater than its predecessor.\n3. **Exit Condition**: When `z` reaches 0, the inner loop exits and `n` is incremented by 1. This indicates that the next element has been processed.\n4. **Invariant Maintenance**: The invariant states that after each iteration of the inner loop, `arr[i]` has been sorted. Therefore, after completing all iterations of the outer loop, `arr` will be sorted from `i` to the end.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the `insertion_sort` function."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = 0\n    while n <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        n += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6211\u5c06\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f60\u4fee\u590d\u5b83\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u505a\u4e86\u4ee5\u4e0b\u66f4\u6539\uff1a\n\n* \u5c06\u53d8\u91cf\u540d `i` \u548c `z` \u6539\u4e3a\u66f4\u6613\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d `key` \u548c `j`\u3002\n* \u786e\u4fdd\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u53ea\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u8d1f\u7d22\u5f15\uff08\u5373 `range(1, len(arr))`\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u539f\u59cb\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528 `i`\uff08\u6216\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e3a `z` \u7684\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d22\u5f15\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n* \u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7f29\u8fdb\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8bed\u53e5\u6309\u9884\u671f\u6267\u884c\u3002\n\n\u5e0c\u671b\u8fd9\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff01\u5982\u679c\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u5173\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bf7\u968f\u65f6\u63d0\u95ee\u3002"}]
