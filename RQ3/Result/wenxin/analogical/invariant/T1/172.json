It holds at the start of each iteration and is maintained by the insertion sort algorithm.\n\nHere's a detailed explanation of how the invariant is maintained:\n\n* At the start of each iteration, `arr[i]` is the element to be inserted into its correct position in the sorted array.\n* The inner while loop moves `arr[i]` to the correct position by swapping it with any element in front of it that is greater than it. This ensures that `arr[i]` is always in its correct position.\n* After the inner loop, `m` is incremented by 1, indicating that one more element has been processed.\n* The invariant holds at the start of each iteration because `arr[i]` is smaller than any element in front of it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The insertion sort algorithm has a correct loop invariant that ensures its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    m = 0\n    while m <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        m += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u90e8\u88ab\u91cd\u5199\u4e3a`z`\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e00\u4e9b\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u8fd8\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5c06\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u6539\u4e3a`z`\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f60\u5374\u7528`arr[i]`\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728Python\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u3002\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u50cf\u8fd9\u6837\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u5373\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u597d\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79fb\u52a8\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
