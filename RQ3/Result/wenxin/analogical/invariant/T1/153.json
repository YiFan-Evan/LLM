The loop continues until `n` reaches the length of the array minus one, ensuring that the last element is not included in the sum.\n\nThe invariant also ensures that the loop terminates because it checks `n <= len(arr) - 1` instead of `n < len(arr)` as in the original code. This ensures that the loop terminates when `n` reaches the length of the array, which is one less than the maximum index of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the modified version of the program `give_sum`."}]
