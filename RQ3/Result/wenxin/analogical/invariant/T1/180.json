The outer while loop iterates from a to z-1, inclusive.\n2. The inner while loop iterates from z to the end of the array.\n3. The inner loop compares each element in the a to z range with the first element of the range (arr[a]). If an element is found that is smaller than arr[a], it swaps the first element of the range with this smaller element.\n4. After the inner loop finishes, a is incremented by 1, and the process repeats for the next iteration of the outer loop.\n\nThe invariant ensures that each iteration of the outer loop will sort a contiguous range of elements in ascending order, until all elements are sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The selection sort algorithm ensures that the array is partially correct after each iteration of the outer loop, because the elements in the a to z range are sorted in ascending order after each iteration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    a = 0\n    while a <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = a + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[a]:\n                temp = arr[a]\n                arr[a] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        a += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u51fa\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bf7\u8be6\u7ec6\u8bf4\u660e\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u5c3d\u529b\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f60\u89e3\u7b54\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5bf9\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u7591\u95ee\u6216\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u6211\u4f1a\u63d0\u4f9b\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u3002"}]
