The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

In the first iteration, `f` is zero, so `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[0]` holds by definition.\n2. In each subsequent iteration, we start by moving `arr[z]` to its correct position in the sorted part of the array. This ensures that `arr[z] <= arr[z+1] <= ... <= arr[f]` holds.\n3. Then, we increment `f` by one, which means that `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[f-1] <= arr[f]` holds.\n\nOverall, the invariant for each iteration of the loop is that `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[f-1] <= arr[f]`, which proves that this loop is partially correct for implementing insertion sort."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    f = 0\n    while f <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        f += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u540d\u548c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0a\u6709\u4e9b\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\u6211\u5c06\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u4e00\u4e9b\u8c03\u6574\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6211\u5bf9\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u5efa\u8bae\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    f = 0\n    while f < len(arr):\n        z = f\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            arr[z], arr[z - 1] = arr[z - 1], arr[z]\n            z -= 1\n        f = z + 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u5730\u8868\u793a\u5b83\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\uff08`f`\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a`z`\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u503c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6bd4\u8f83`arr[z - 1]`\u548c`arr[z]`\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u524d\u8005\u5927\u4e8e\u540e\u8005\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c31\u4ea4\u6362\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6211\u4eec\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8be5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5c0f\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u4e8e\u5176\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u589e\u52a0`f`\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6307\u7684\u662f\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u5faa\u73af\u4e4b\u540e`f`\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5b83\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u5faa\u73af\u540e\u90fd\u4f1a\u6307\u5411\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff08\u5373\u5728\u539f\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6bd4\u4e0a\u4e00\u8f6e\u5927\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f60\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002"}]
