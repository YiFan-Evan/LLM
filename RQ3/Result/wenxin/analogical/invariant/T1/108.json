[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

It is initialized to -1, and then increased by 1 for each iteration until it reaches the length of the array. If the current index `i` matches the target `id`, then `arr[i]` is assigned to `member_value_candidate` and the loop continues.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for this program is correct because it ensures that each iteration of the loop has a valid candidate member to be found.
