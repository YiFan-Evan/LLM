[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n```less\narr[i] == target -> id_value = i\n```\n\nThis invariant ensures that the value of `id_value` will be incremented each time we find a target element in the array.\n\nIn each iteration, we compare the current element `arr[i]` with the target `target`. If they are equal, we update `id_value` with the current index `i`. After this, we increment `o` by 1 to move to the next element in the array.\n\nIf the target element is found in the array, `id_value` will contain the index of the target. If the loop ends without finding the target, `id_value` will still be -1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the program.
