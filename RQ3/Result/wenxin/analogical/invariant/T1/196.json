It is maintained by the inner while loop, which moves the minimum element to its correct position at each iteration.\n\nHere's the explanation for each part of the invariant:\n\n* `arr[i] <= arr[i+1]`: This ensures that the element at index `i+1` is greater than or equal to the element at index `i`. This is maintained by the outer while loop, which moves the leftmost unsorted element to its correct position at each iteration.\n* `<= ... <= arr[q]`: This ensures that all elements between `i` and `q` are sorted in ascending order. This is maintained by the inner while loop, which moves the minimum element to its correct position at each iteration.\n* `q` is the index of the last element that has not been swapped yet: This ensures that `q` is always increasing, and it corresponds to the current \"sorted\" part of the array. At each iteration, the minimum element is swapped with the element at `q`, so it moves closer to the right end of the sorted part of the array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    while q <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = q + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[q]:\n                temp = arr[q]\n                arr[q] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`len(arr) - 1`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`q <= len(arr) - 1`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u90fd\u4f1a\u904d\u5386\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    for q in range(len(arr)):\n        for z in range(q + 1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[z] < arr[q]:\n                temp = arr[q]\n                arr[q] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n        q += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u5269\u4f59\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u7f6e\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u5c06\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
