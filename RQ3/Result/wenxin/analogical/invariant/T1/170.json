The code also includes a while loop, which will continue to loop until all elements have been sorted.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be written as:\n\n\n```python\narr[i] = fun(arr[i], arr[i-1])\n```\nHere, `fun` is a function that takes two arguments and returns a value. It is assumed that `fun` is implemented in the code somewhere and its purpose is to compare two adjacent elements in the array and return a value indicating their relative order.\n\nThe loop invariant ensures that the i-th element of the array is correctly sorted relative to its neighbors.
