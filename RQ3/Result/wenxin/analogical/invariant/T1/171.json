This ensures that `arr[l]` remains less than or equal to `arr[l + 1]`, and so on, until `arr[i - 1]` is reached.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5199\u7684\u662f `i` \u800c\u4e0d\u662f `z`\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d `i` \u548c `z` \u662f\u533a\u5206\u5927\u5c0f\u5199\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528 `z` \u800c\u4e0d\u662f `i`\u3002\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = l\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4 `arr` \u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ecf\u5178\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u65ad\u5730\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u4ea4\u6362\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5927\u4e8e\u540e\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c31\u4ea4\u6362\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6211\u4eec\u904d\u5386\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u91cd\u590d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u5b8c\u5168\u6709\u5e8f\u3002"}]
