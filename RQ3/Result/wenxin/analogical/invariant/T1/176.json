If so, it swaps them using the `fun` operation.\n5. `temp = arr[z]`: This stores the element that needs to be swapped.\n6. `arr[z] = arr[z - 1]`: This swaps the element with its previous value, which is now in its correct position.\n7. `arr[z - 1] = temp`: This swaps the new element with its previous value, which is now in its correct position.\n8. `z -= 1`: The inner loop continues until no more swaps are needed.\n9. `q += 1`: The outer loop advances `q` by one, indicating that the current subarray has been sorted.\n10. `return arr`: The function returns the sorted array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm is that `in_array_value[i]` is in its correct position within the sorted subarray, and there are no elements in the subarray that need to be swapped to their correct positions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    while q <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6211\u5c06\u4e3a\u4f60\u4fee\u590d\u5b83\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:  # \u6ce8\u610f\u8fd9\u91cc\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528len(arr) - 1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6570\u7ec4\u5728Python\u4e2d\u662f\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\n        z = q + 1\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:  # \u8fd9\u91cc\u4e5f\u5e94\u8be5\u662farr[z - 1] > arr[z]\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0ci\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6307\u9488\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u503c\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u73b0\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u6309\u7167\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u4e86\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u627e\u5230\u9700\u8981\u63d2\u5165\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u3002\u5e0c\u671b\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f60\u3002"}]
