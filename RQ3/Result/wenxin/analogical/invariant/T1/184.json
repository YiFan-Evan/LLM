The outer while loop iterates over the array from index e to the end.\n2. The inner while loop within the outer loop iterates from index z to the end and compares each element with the element at index e.\n3. If an element at index z is found to be less than the element at index e, then it swaps them. This ensures that the element at index e becomes the minimum element in its current subarray.\n4. After each iteration of the inner loop, index e is incremented by 1, which moves to the next unsorted subarray.\n5. The invariant ensures that the elements in each subarray are sorted in ascending order. Therefore, after the outer loop completes, the entire array will be sorted in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant proves that the selection sort algorithm for this problem partially corrects the provided Python program code."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = e + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[e]:\n                temp = arr[e]\n                arr[e] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u4ece\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5b58\u653e\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5168\u90e8\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5143\u7d20\u6392\u5b8c\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5df2\u7ecf\u6b63\u786e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5373\u6bcf\u6b21\u4ece\u5269\u4f59\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08\u5373e\uff09\u5411\u540e\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4f4d\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u91cd\u590d\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u6392\u5e8f\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5199\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\uff0c\u5982\uff1a\n\n\n```python\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nprint(selection_sort(arr))\n```\n\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a`[11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]`\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u4f60\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u51fd\u6570\u5df2\u7ecf\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u4e86\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u505a\u4efb\u4f55\u4fee\u6539\u3002"}]
