If arr[j] is greater than max_value, update max_value.\n* Return max_value after loop completes.\n\nProblem 2: Find the maximum element in a sorted array.\n\nSolution:\n\n* Loop invariant: max_value = arr[0]\n* The loop invariant ensures that at each iteration, the maximum value in the current subarray is always the first element of the subarray. Since the array is sorted, this invariant holds true.\n* Return max_value after loop completes.\n\nProblem 3: Find the maximum element in an array that may contain duplicates.\n\nSolution:\n\n* Loop invariant: max_value = arr[0] and j is the index of the current maximum element in the array.\n* The loop invariant ensures that at each iteration, j points to the index of the current maximum element in the array. It also ensures that if we move to the next element, it cannot be greater than the current maximum element.
