The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the above insertion sort algorithm is:\n\n\n```makefile\narr[t - 1] <= arr[t]\n```\nThe reason is as follows:\n\n* In the while loop, the index t represents the current position of the element in the array. Initially, arr[t] is set to the first element in the array.\n* Inside the while loop, we perform a swap operation to move an element arr[z] to its correct position in the sorted array. The swap operation ensures that arr[z - 1] is always smaller than arr[z]. Therefore, arr[t - 1] <= arr[t] holds true after each swap operation.\n* The outer while loop continues until t reaches the end of the array. Therefore, the invariant holds true for each iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm in the provided code is arr[t - 1] <= arr[t]."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    t = 0\n    while t <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        t += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u660e\u767d\u4e86\uff0c\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u903b\u8f91\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`j`\u662f\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5b57\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u3002\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u4ed6\u540d\u79f0\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982`temp_index`\u6216`current_index`\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    t = 0\n    while t < len(arr) - 1:\n        temp_index = 0\n        while temp_index > -1 and arr[temp_index] > arr[temp_index + 1]:\n            temp = arr[temp_index]\n            arr[temp_index] = arr[temp_index + 1]\n            arr[temp_index + 1] = temp\n            temp_index -= 1\n        t += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u7528`temp_index`\u4ee3\u66ff\u4e86\u539f\u6765\u7684`z`\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u6211\u4e5f\u66f4\u6b63\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5b57\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u539f\u6765\u7684\u8bed\u53e5\"arr[z - 1] > arr[z]\"\u6539\u4e3a\"arr[temp_index] > arr[temp_index + 1]\"\u3002\u73b0\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\u4e86\u3002"}]
