The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The function 'fun' subtracts the current value of 'arr[member_value_incremented]' from 'member_value_incremented' and returns the result.\n\nHere's the detailed explanation for each part:\n\n1. 'member_value = -1': This initializes 'member_value' to -1, which is a valid value for the program.\n2. 'g = 0': This initializes 'g', which represents the index of the current element in the array.\n3. 'while g < len(arr):': This ensures that the loop will continue until 'g' reaches the length of the array.\n4. 'if g == id:': This checks if 'g' is equal to the desired id ('id'). If it is, it sets 'member_value' to the value of 'arr[g]' and continues with the next iteration.\n5. 'g += 1': This increments 'g' by 1, moving to the next element in the array.\n6. 'member_value_incremented = fun(arr[member_value_incremented] - arr[member_value_incremented])': At each iteration, this function calculates the difference between the current value of 'arr[member_value_incremented]' and subtracts it from 'member_value_incremented'. This ensures that 'member_value' gets incremented after each iteration and will reach its final value after all iterations are completed.\n7. 'return member_value': This returns the final value of 'member_value', which is the desired member id.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided program is partially correct because it correctly sets 'member_value' to the desired member id after each iteration of the loop.
