While there may be instances of a newborn baby being stillborn, that is a different situation altogether. However, with some time, most newborn living beings are already ready to start reproducing and this is where the option E fits.

Start reproduction. The description of the options in the question shows that they do not apply to the given scenario of a living being being born. Death and sometimes bad are inappropriate because living beings are not typically 'dead' when they are born and 'sometimes bad' does not explain what happens at birth. Growing older is also not relevant because it refers to a process that occurs over time, not at birth. Therefore, the only option that fits the description of what happens at birth is start reproduction."}]
