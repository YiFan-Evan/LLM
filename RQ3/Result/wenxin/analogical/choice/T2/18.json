You said 'own house', which is also a possible option. But based on the question, I'm answering 'office building'. This is because it's a basement that can be accessed with an elevator and it is most commonly found in office buildings. On the other hand, other options such as own house, closet and eat cake are not related to a basement that can be accessed with an elevator."}]
