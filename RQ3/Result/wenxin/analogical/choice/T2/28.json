Born Again.\n\nCorrect answer is \"D. Born Again\" because Christians believe that to be saved and go to heaven, a person must undergo a spiritual rebirth or conversion, which usually involves repenting of past sins and trusting in Jesus Christ as their personal Savior. This is why the question specifically mentions \"born again\" as an option. The other options are not consistent with Christian beliefs about heaven and salvation."}]
