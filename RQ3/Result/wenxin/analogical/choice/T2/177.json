A woman may kill a stranger she met in a dark alley if she was being raped and wanted revenge. She may also kill a stranger if she was being threatened or attacked. However, getting rid of or being raped is not a valid reason for killing a stranger. Evil is a subjective term and cannot be used to explain why someone would kill a stranger.

So, given that this question specifically mentions a woman killing a stranger in a dark alley, the correct answer is \"get revenge\". This is because the question does not provide any other reason for such a violent act, and the only one that makes sense is that she was seeking revenge."}]
