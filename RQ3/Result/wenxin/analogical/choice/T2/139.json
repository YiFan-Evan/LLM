Interruption. Interruption could lead to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, which are common factors that contribute to suicide attempts. In this case, the individual may feel like they have no control over the interruption and that it is beyond their ability to cope with, leading to thoughts of giving up and attempting suicide. \n\nIn general, hatred and dying are not the direct reasons for an unsuccessful suicide attempt. If someone wants to commit suicide, they are looking for an end to life or some sense of control, both of which can't be achieved if there is a delay in execution or if the individual doesn't commit suicide at the first attempt. A is an irrelevant option. If you're facing some problem in your life or if you feel like you're in a desperate situation, please seek help immediately.
