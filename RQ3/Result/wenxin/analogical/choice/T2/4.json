This is the correct answer because it is the only option that accurately describes the mental state of the person, who was having a hard time expressing himself in a healthy way. The other options are not relevant or accurate. For example, \"fun\" is not a mental state, \"embarrassment\" may be related to expressing oneself poorly, but it does not describe the overall situation, and \"understood\" is not related to the question at all. \"Slow\" is not a mental state that would cause difficulty expressing oneself."}]
