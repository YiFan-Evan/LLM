While she was gone, he used it to install. As Sarah was away, he needed to install something in her home. Installing something is done in front of the door, and not at the front door. Turning lock is done by the person who lives there and not someone visiting. Solution to problem is related to specific issues but not when someone is away. Opening doors doesn't need someone to install something, and usually it's already done when a door is brought inside. So, the answer is D. Install. Therefore, the final answer is: D.

While she was gone, he used it to install. Sarah gave her brother a guy to her home and while she was away, he used it to install something in her home. Installing something is done to keep the home functional and protected and while Sarah was away, this would have been necessary. So, using a person in the house for installing items makes sense, whereas using the person for other options would be strange. Therefore, the answer is B. Install. \n\nIf you have any further questions, please let me know."}]
