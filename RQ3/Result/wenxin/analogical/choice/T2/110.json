Play music. A band would be performing music when there are no people nearby because they are holding a concert. Playing music is the act of performing music for an audience, and a band would need to perform for an audience to make money or gain recognition. Playing music for no one nearby would not make sense.

Concerts are events where bands or artists perform for an audience, and they often use venues that have a capacity for people. If there are no people nearby, the band may still perform for a small audience or in a venue that is not full. However, if they were just playing music for no one, it would not make sense. Therefore, the answer is C. Hold concert."}]
