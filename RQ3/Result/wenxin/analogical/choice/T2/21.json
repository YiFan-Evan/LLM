Therefore, the final answer is C. depression. All the other options given do not directly answer the question and do not refer to the opposite of an area of elevation. For example, 'demotion' refers to a situation where one is demoted in rank or status, and 'reduction' refers to a decrease in quantity or amount. Both these options are related to the idea of decreasing something, but not the opposite of an area of elevation. Similarly, 'diminishment' and 'disgust' are not related to the idea of an area of elevation and its opposite."}]
