Yellow pages is a directory of businesses and not a place where you can go to find restaurants. Towns are small urban areas with a limited range of businesses, and are not necessarily a good option for finding a wide range of restaurants. Hence, these options are incorrect. The correct answer is C. \"Small town\", which has a wide range of restaurants between 1000 and 10,000."}]
