Tiredness is the most likely result of long-term house cleaning activities, as it requires physical effort and energy to perform tasks such as sweeping, dusting, and scrubbing. If you engage in such activities for a long time, you may experience fatigue and need to rest and recuperate. On the other hand, sneezing, exhaustion, and order are not necessarily related to house cleaning and may be more related to allergies, illness, or mental aspects of house cleaning."}]
