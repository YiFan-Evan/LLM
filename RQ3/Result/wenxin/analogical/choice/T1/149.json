Zane may suffer from confusion when answering questions because he may not understand the question or may have difficulty expressing himself. This could lead to him not being good at answering questions.\n\nExplanation of each option:\n\n* Panic: While panic may affect an individual's ability to answer questions, it is not usually the reason for not being good at answering questions.\n* Discussion: Discussion is not related to answering questions poorly, but it may help in understanding the question better.\n* Attention: Attention may not be the cause of answering questions poorly, but it can help focus better when answering questions.\n* Satisfaction: Satisfaction is not related to answering questions, and it is not the reason for not being good at answering questions.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Zane may suffer from confusion when answering questions because he may not understand the question or may have difficulty expressing himself."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Zane doesn't like answering questions.
