An area of elevation is an area where there is an increase in height or level, while the opposite of this is an area where there is a decrease in height or level, which is reduction. Diminishment, demotion and depression are not the opposite of an area of elevation as they do not describe a decrease in height or level. If an area is elevated, it is increased in height or level, so the opposite of this would be to decrease its height or level. Therefore, the opposite of an area of elevation is reduction."}]
