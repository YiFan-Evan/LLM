Ink is a liquid that flows within the pen and provides a consistent flow of ink onto the paper when writing. This prevents the pen from drying out because it keeps the ink reservoir filled and allows for continuous writing. The other options are incorrect because they do not address the issue of preventing a pen from drying out. Write sentences on paper is not related to preventing a pen from drying out, ink cartridges and caps are unrelated to putting something on a pen, and cling film is a method of sealing something rather than preventing it from drying out.
