Lift weights is a form of anaerobic exercising. In anaerobic exercise, energy is produced without oxygen by the body\u2019s cells. This energy is needed for short, intense exercises such as lifting weights. Shortness of breath, error, and fall down are not related to anaerobic exercise and are not options for this question.

Lift weights is a form of anaerobic exercising. As explained above, anaerobic exercise is an exercise in which energy is produced without oxygen by the body\u2019s cells. Therefore, shortness of breath, error, and fall down are not related to anaerobic exercise and are not options for this question. The other options, E. run and D. fall down, are related to anaerobic exercise in that they involve intense exercise without oxygen. However, they are not the only form of anaerobic exercise. Therefore, the final answer is B. Lift weights."}]
