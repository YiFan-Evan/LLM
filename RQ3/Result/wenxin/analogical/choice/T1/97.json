Inner Ear. The student explained that he had a clue about neuroepithelium and got really nervous, which led him to lose his balance. This is likely due to an imbalance in the inner ear, which can cause vertigo or a sensation of spinning, and thus is a plausible cause for the student\u2019s nervousness and balance loss.
