However, if there is only one person speaking, it could be in a university campus, where a professor or guest speaker might be giving a lecture in a classroom or lecture hall. The auditorium itself does not need a crowd or lights to be functioning, but rather it needs a speaker. A park is typically not a venue for lectures or presentations, and a theater is usually designed for multiple actors to perform together. Therefore, the answer of C. university campus is the most appropriate option for the question."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where would there be an auditorium with only a single person speaking?\nOptions: E. park D. theater C. university campus B. crowd A. lights"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The answer is E.
