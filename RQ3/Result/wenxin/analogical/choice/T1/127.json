Machines can perform work that humans cannot do. As stated in the question, machines have a range of physical and cognitive abilities that are not available to humans, allowing them to perform a wide variety of tasks and workloads that humans would find challenging or impossible. This includes tasks such as manufacturing, assembly, and transportation, which require precise movements and repetitive tasks that are difficult for humans to perform.
