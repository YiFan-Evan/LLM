You said that I can enter \"own house\" using a key, which is incorrect. The correct answer is \"kitchen\", because it is the most likely place where you would use a key to open a hinged door to enter. \"Pantry\" and \"building\" are not likely places to enter using a key, while \"safe\" and \"building\" are not mentioned in the question. Therefore, the answer is A. kitchen."}]
