Monkeys often enjoy being in the mulberry bush as it provides them with food and shelter. \n\nIn the other options, like a laboratory, a theatre, a sailor suit and a banana tree, there are humans and artificial environments involved that do not provide monkeys with a natural environment or food that they typically enjoy. So, it is not likely that they would enjoy being in these places. On the other hand, mulberry bushes are typically found in nature and provide monkeys with food and shelter, which is why they enjoy being there."}]
