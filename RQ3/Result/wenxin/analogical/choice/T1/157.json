A hard to read note is likely to be found in sheet music. Sheet music is a written medium that contains music notation and lyrics, making it easy to be illegible and difficult to read for people with poor eyesight or difficulty reading music. Other options, such as a fridge, desk, bed, and medical chart, are unlikely to contain notes that are hard to read because they are typically not used for writing."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where is hard to read note likely to be?\nOptions: E. medical chart D. bed C. desk B. sheet music A. fridge"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The correct answer is E. Medical chart. Medical charts often contain text and symbols that are difficult to read for many people due to their small size, font type, and lack of contrast. This makes them a common place for hard to read notes. The other options, such as a fridge, desk, bed, and sheet music, are not typically used for writing or displaying notes that are difficult to read."}]
