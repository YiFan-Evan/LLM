A living being experiences death at birth due to the lack of oxygen and nutrients in the womb. Although it may seem like a new life has begun, it is actually the beginning of the process of decay and eventual death. Growth and reproduction occur after the body has adapted to its new environment and has sufficient oxygen and nutrients."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What happens at soon as a living being is born? (Since the model's top reason words include \"cub\" and \"reproduction\", it is likely that the model has associated the concept of reproduction with the word \"born\".
