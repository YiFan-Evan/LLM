(Since the model has identified the words \"commuting\" and \"working\" in the top 5 reason-words, it has likely determined that the decision to take a bus to \"get somewhere\" is related to the need to commute to work. Additionally, the model may have considered the possibility that the individual is looking for a cheaper, more environmentally-friendly option than driving a truck or car.
