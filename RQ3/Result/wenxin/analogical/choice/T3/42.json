Ink is a liquid that is used to write with and it can prevent the pen from drying out by keeping it moist. Write sentences on paper, ink cartridges, and caps are not related to preventing a pen from drying out.

Ink cartridges contain ink that can be used in a pen, providing a solution to prevent it from drying out. Cling film and caps do not provide an ink solution and may not be the most effective way to prevent a pen from drying out. Write sentences on paper is a more general term and does not provide a specific ink solution. Therefore, the final answer is: C. ink cartridges."}]
