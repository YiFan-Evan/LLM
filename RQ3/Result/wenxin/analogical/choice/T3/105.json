(Since the reason-words \"adhere\" and \"widely_held_stock\" imply a public image or persona that needs to be maintained and strengthened, and \"being_ridiculed\" suggests potential negative consequences of going public with a problem, the model predicts that the desired outcome for a celebrity when going public about a common problem would be to gain \"press coverage\".
