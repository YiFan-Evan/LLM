In the past, women were expected to wear a dress, but now they are free to wear what they want, including pants. Pants are a more practical and comfortable option for women, especially in casual or business settings. They are also becoming more popular and acceptable for women to wear. Therefore, the choice of clothing should be based on personal preference and comfort, rather than societal expectations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Women used to be expected to wear a dress but it's now acceptable for them to wear what? (Since the model has identified the reason-words \"expect_unexpected\" and \"surprise\", it suggests that the change from women being expected to wear dresses to now having the option to wear something else is a significant shift in societal expectations. The reason-word \"cat\" could potentially refer to the idea of women being independent and free to make their own choices, while \"nude\" might suggest that the model is considering the possibility of more revealing clothing as a potential option.
