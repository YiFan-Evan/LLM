The sentence indicates that they had a theory of what they could do in the big game, and over and over again, they would practise to achieve success. Therefore, the final answer is: \"Therefore, the final answer is: practise\". Note that \"park\" and \"fact\" are unrelated options, and \"cooperation\" may be mentioned as a reason for practising, but it is not directly related to the question itself. \"Practical\" could refer to practical approach or application, but not specifically \"practise\". Therefore, \"practise\" is the most appropriate option."}]
