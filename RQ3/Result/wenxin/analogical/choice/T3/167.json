This is because the Apache helicopter uses electric motors to power its rotors and other components. Jet engines are used for propelling airplanes and other aircraft, while rotators are used for rotating objects, not for powering aircraft. Electrical circuits are used for controlling and powering electronic devices, not for powering aircraft. Therefore, the correct answer is C. electric motor."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: George checked the rotor of the Apache, which wasn't powered by internal combustion, but by what?
