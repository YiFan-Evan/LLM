Cats are often known for their sharp claws, which they use to hunt and scratch. This is one of the most distinctive features of cats. They also have whiskers, which help them navigate and judge distances, but this is not as well-known as their sharp claws. Cats do not have sharp teeth or four legs like dogs, and purring is a natural behavior that does not define them as much as their sharp claws do."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What are cats often known for?
