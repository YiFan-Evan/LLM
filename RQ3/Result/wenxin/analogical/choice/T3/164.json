The other options do not quite fit this definition. \"More\" is already a synonym for \"little\" in some contexts, so it is not an option. \"Big\" and \"lot of\" do not have the same meaning as \"little\" or \"few\", and are therefore also not suitable options. \"Much\" is indeed the opposite of \"little\", but it does not quite fit the context of this question, as it implies a large amount, which is not necessarily the opposite of scarcity or insufficiency. Therefore, the best fit for the context of this question is \"plenty\"."}]
