The question specifically mentions a basement that can be accessed with an elevator, and since the word \"own\" is present in the option \"own house\", it is the correct answer. The other options, such as eat cake, closet, and church, do not have the word \"own\" in them, and therefore are not applicable. Office buildings typically do not have basements that are accessible with an elevator, but are accessible through stairs or other means."}]
