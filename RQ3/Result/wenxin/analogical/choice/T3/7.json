The family wanted to adopt for environmental and ethical reasons. Therefore, they didn't want to foster children because that involves fostering and training of a child to give it a safe and stable home. Abandoning children would mean they were unable to provide that necessary care. If the family could have a child biological, they would rather have that, but in their decision they were adopting. So the family did not abhor foster children, which is why they adopted them."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The family wanted to adopt for enviro-ethical reasons, what did they abhor? (Since the model identified the word \"unethical\" in the top reason-words, it predicted that the family wanted to adopt for ethical reasons, likely because they abhorred the idea of giving away or abandoning a child.
