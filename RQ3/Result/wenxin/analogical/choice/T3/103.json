The model identified words such as \"relocation\" and \"airline_terminal\" as important factors that would suggest that traveling from one place to another would be a relocation. Additionally, the presence of words such as \"increased_pressure_from_water\" and \"farm_animal\" did not weigh heavily towards any of the other potential choices, which reinforces the decision to select D. relocation.
