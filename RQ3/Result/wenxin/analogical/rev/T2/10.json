Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Set the start node as the current node and initialize a queue with the start node.\n2. Set the current distance as 0.\n3. Iterate through the queue until it's empty.\n\t* For each node in the queue, check if it's the destination node (node 0). If it is, return the path from the start node to the destination node.\n\t* If it's not, expand the current node's neighbors by moving to the next adjacent node in the graph and update the distance to that node.\n\t\t+ Add the expanded node to the queue.\n\t\t+ Update the distance of the expanded node with the current distance plus 1.\n4. If the queue is empty after iterating through all nodes, return an error message or an explanation that no path exists from node 1 to node 0.\n\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 1 to node 0 is 1->3->4->0.
