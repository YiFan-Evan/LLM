It creates a dictionary `shortest_path` to store the shortest path and a queue `queue` to store nodes to be visited. It then iterates over the queue and adds neighbors of the current node that are not visited and are not the end node to the queue and their distance to the current node. Finally, it returns the shortest path from the start node to the end node."}]
