Create a new list of nodes that represents the shortest path. Start by adding node 5 to the list.\n2. Then, find the node that is adjacent to node 5 and is connected to node 4 in the graph. If there are multiple nodes with the same distance to node 4, choose any of them. Add this node to the path.\n3. Repeat steps 2 and 1 for all nodes starting with node 6 (because there is no path directly from node 5 to node 4 in the graph).\n\nNow that you have a list of nodes representing the shortest path from node 5 to node 4, you can use this list to create the shortest path. You can do this by creating a new graph where each node represents a vertex in the shortest path and each edge represents the distance between two adjacent nodes in the shortest path.\n\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 is:\n\n5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4\n\nThe length of this path is 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 5 to node 4 is: 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4, with a length of 4."}]
