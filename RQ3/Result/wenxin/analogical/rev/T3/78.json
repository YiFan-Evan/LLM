Repeat step 3 until there are no more nodes to update or there are no more unvisited nodes.\n\nThe shortest path from node 5 to node 2 in this graph is the one that minimizes the sum of the distances between adjacent nodes in the path. We know that node 2 is directly connected to node 6 by an edge, so if we go through node 6, then the total distance would be the length of edge [0, 6], which is 6. However, if we go through node 5 and then node 4, we will have to travel an additional distance of 4 to get to node 4, and then from node 4 to node 2. Therefore, the total distance would be 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. Since the shorter path is 6, we can conclude that the shortest path from node 5 to node 2 is:\n\n5 -> 6 -> 2\n\nIn this path, node 6 is the next node in the shortest path after node 5, and node 2 is the final node in the shortest path after node 6.
