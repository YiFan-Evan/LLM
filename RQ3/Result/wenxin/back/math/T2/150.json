To calculate the indefinite integral of this function, we need to use the fundamental principles of integration.\n\nIntegration is the process of finding the area under a curve. To integrate a function, we need to divide the interval of integration into smaller intervals and approximate the area under the curve using the endpoints of each interval.\n\nFor this particular function, we can use the integration techniques for exponential and trigonometric functions. The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x, and the indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x).
