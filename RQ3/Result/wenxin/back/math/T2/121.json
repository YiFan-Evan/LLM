Integration is the process of taking the derivative of the opposite of a function (in this case, 1/x), which is -x. So, the indefinite integral of 1/x is -x dx.\n\nNow, we need to substitute 'x=4' into this result. When we substitute 4 for x in the indefinite integral -x dx, we get:\n\n-4 dx\n\nSince we are taking the indefinite integral of a function (which includes both the function and its derivative), this is equivalent to finding the area under the curve of the function from some point (in this case, -infinity) to 4. The area under the curve is equal to the area above the curve, so we can also calculate it by subtracting 4 from infinity (i.e., infinity - 4) and multiplying by the width of the interval (dx).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -4 * 1 = -4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1/x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5 * (1/x) is: 5 / x - 5 * x dx.
