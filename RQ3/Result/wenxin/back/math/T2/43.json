Therefore, we can separate the function into two parts: e^x and cos(x).\n\nThe indefinite integral of e^x is e^x, and the indefinite integral of cos(x) is -sin(x). Adding these two together, we get the indefinite integral of e^x*cos(x): e^x - sin(x).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace x with 4.
