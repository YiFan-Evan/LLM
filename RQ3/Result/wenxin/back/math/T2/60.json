Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function and then subtracting a constant, which is usually 0. For this problem, we need to find the derivative of the function and then take the derivative of the denominator.\n\nThe derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), and the derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x). Therefore, the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222b sin(x) / sinh(x) dx = \u222b cos(x) / cosh(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to take the derivative of the denominator cosh(x). The derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x). So, the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222b cos(x) / (cosh(x)) dx = \u222b (sinh(x)) / (cosh(x)) dx\n\nFinally, we need to substitute 'x=4' into the indefinite integral. The indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222b (sinh(4)) / (cosh(4)) dx\n\nNow, we can evaluate this integral by substituting 'x=4' into the integrand and simplifying. We have:\n\n\u222b (sinh(4)) / (cosh(4)) dx = \u222b (sinh(4)) dx\n\nThe indefinite integral of sinh(4) is: -cosh(4), so the final result is: -cosh(4) + C, where C is an integration constant. To find the value of C, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral with a different value of x, and that's typically done by integrating it over a small interval and finding a suitable limit for the integral. But for now, we can approximate it by considering C=0, so that our final expression is: -cosh(4). To find this in integers, we need to take the absolute value of the result and round down.
