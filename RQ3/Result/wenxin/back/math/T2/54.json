Since we don't know the value of C, we can't give a precise integer result. We can only estimate that if C were equal to some positive integer value, the final result would be that integer value. Based on this estimation, we can conclude that the integer result is at least 20.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 20 (rounded down)."}]
