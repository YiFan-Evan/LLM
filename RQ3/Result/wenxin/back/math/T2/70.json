Integration is a mathematical operation that takes a function and finds its derivative, which is a form of expressing how the function changes over time or distance. Trigonometric functions are used to represent the angles of a triangle, and they are commonly used in physics and engineering.\n\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of the function, we need to use integration formulas and trigonometric identities. Here's the formula for indefinite integration of a product:\n\n\u222b(f(x) * g(x)) dx = (f(x) d[g(x)] + g(x) df(x)) / 2.\n\nSo, if we take your function: cos(x) * sinh(x), we can use the formula above to integrate each term separately:\n\n\u222bcos(x) d[sinh(x)] = sinh(x)cos(x) + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of your function is: (sinh(x)cos(x)).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we need to multiply the indefinite integral by 4. Therefore, the expression after substituting 'x=4' is: 4 * (sinh(4)cos(4)).\n\nFinally, to find the integer result of this expression, we need to round down to the nearest integer.
