The indefinite integral of ln(cos(x)) is -sin(x) + C, which can be ignored here.\n\nTherefore, we only need to consider the indefinite integral of e^x. This can be done using the basic integration principles. e^x is a power function with exponent x, and its indefinite integral is e^x. Substituting 'x=4' into e^x, we get the indefinite integral at x=4 as e^4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: e^4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(ln(cos(x))*e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The function 5*(ln(cos(x)) * e^x) can be simplified to 5 * (ln(1) + e^x * (cos(x))'')\n\nThe indefinite integral of ln(cos(x)) is -sin(x) + C, which can be ignored here.\n\nThe indefinite integral of e^x * cos(x) is e^x * sin(x) + C.\n\nTherefore, we have to evaluate 5 times this indefinite integral which results in: 5*e^x*sin(x) + 5*C.
