In order to calculate its indefinite integral, we need to solve each function separately.\n\nThe first function, 1/x, is an inverse function of x. Therefore, the indefinite integral of this function is simply -ln(x) + constant.\n\nThe second function, e^x, is an exponential function. Therefore, the indefinite integral of this function is e^x + constant.\n\nWhen we combine these two indefinite integrals, we get -ln(x) * e^x + constant_1 + constant_2.
