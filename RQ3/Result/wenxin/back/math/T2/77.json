Integration is the process of taking the derivative of the opposite of a function, which is equal to the sum of the constant term and the indefinite integral of the function. Therefore, we can use the following formula:\n\n\u222b(1+x)/ln(x)dx = \u222bx/ln(x)dx + \u222b1dx\n\nThe indefinite integral of x/ln(x) is (1/ln(x)) * (ln(x))' = (1/ln(x)) * 1 = 1/ln(x). For the second integral, we have:\n\n\u222b1dx = x + C, where C is a constant.\n\nSo, putting everything together, we get:\n\n\u222b(1+x)/ln(x)dx = \u222bx/ln(x)dx + \u222b1dx = \u222bx/ln(x)dx + x + C\n\nNow, substituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222b(1+4)/ln(4)dx = \u222b4/ln(4)dx + 4 + C\n\nTo solve this last integral, we can use the following property of the natural logarithm: ln(xy) = ln(x) + ln(y). Using this property, we can simplify the expression to:\n\n\u222b4/ln(4)dx = \u222b4/(2ln(2))dx = 2\u222bln(2)dx = 2*ln(2)*ln(2) = 4\n\nTherefore, substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get:\n\n\u222b(1+4)/ln(4)dx = 4 + 4 + C = 8 + C\n\nSince C is an arbitrary constant, we can ignore it and just round down to get the final integer result:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1+x)/ln(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5 times the function (1+x)/ln(x) is:\n\n\u222b(5 \u00d7 (1+x)/ln(x))dx = \u222b(5 \u00d7 (1+x))dx/ln(x)\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n\u222b(5 \u00d7 (1+x))dx is the indefinite integral of 5 times the function 1+x. The indefinite integral of 5 is 5, so we get 5\u222b(1+x)dx.\n\nThe indefinite integral of 1+x is ln(x) + C, where C is a constant. So, we get 5(ln(x) + C).\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222b(5 \u00d7 (1+4)/ln(4))dx = \u222b(21/ln(4))dx\n\nTo solve this last integral, we can use the property of the natural logarithm mentioned above, ln(xy) = ln(x) + ln(y), which allows us to simplify it to:\n\n\u222b21/ln(4)dx = \u222b20.718/(ln2 + 0.388)dx\n\nAfter performing the integration, we get the following result:\n\nThe final answer is: 9.767\n\nTherefore, substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get: 9.767.
