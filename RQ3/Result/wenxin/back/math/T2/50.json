It's important to note that indefinite integral calculates the general form of the function without a specific constant C. So, the indefinite integral of e^(e^x) would be (e^x)' * e^(e^x). Now, the derivative of e^x is e^x, so the indefinite integral becomes e^(e^x) * e^(e^x) = e^(2*e^x).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 462664585.\n\nTo answer your question, when you substitute 'x=4', the expression becomes e^(4^x), which in this case evaluates to approximately 3885365328358653668846945392231126.
