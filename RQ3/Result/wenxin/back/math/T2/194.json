In particular, this function represents a combination of the natural logarithm, which is denoted as ln, the product operation, and a term that depends on x, denoted as 1+x. To evaluate the indefinite integral of this function, we need to determine the form of the integral and how to evaluate it. However, since we are excluding the constant C, we can safely assume that the indefinite integral will involve the same mathematical functions, but without the constant term.\n\nTo evaluate the indefinite integral, we need to use the fundamental principles of integration. Integration is a mathematical operation that transforms a function into its anti-derivative, which is a function that remains constant for all values of x except for the specific value(s) for which the original function was evaluated. To evaluate the indefinite integral, we need to find the area under the curve represented by the function.\n\nTherefore, let's apply these principles to the specific function expression (1+x) * ln(x) * ln(x). First, we can break this function down into individual terms and try to isolate each one separately. This allows us to evaluate each term independently and combine them later to obtain the final result.\n\nAfter isolating each term, we find that:\n\n\u222b(1+x) * ln(x) * ln(x) dx = \u222bln(x) * ln(x) dx + \u222bx * ln(x) dx\n\nThe first integral represents the product of two natural logarithms, which can be evaluated using the fundamental properties of the natural logarithm. The result is ln\u00b2(x), which is a constant for all values of x except for x=4. Therefore, when x=4, we have ln\u00b2(4) = 2ln4.\n\nThe second integral represents the product of x and a natural logarithm, which can also be evaluated using the fundamental properties of the natural logarithm. The result is ln(x) * x, which also remains constant for all values of x except for x=4. Therefore, when x=4, we have ln(4) * 4 = 4ln4.\n\nTo combine these results, we multiply by dx (the derivative of x), integrate them, and take the limit as x approaches infinity. This gives us the indefinite integral:\n\n\u222bln\u00b2(x) + ln(x) * x dx = (ln4 + xln4)/2 + C\n\nSubstituting x=4 into this expression results in (ln4 + 4ln4)/2 = (ln4 + 4ln4)/2 = (3+8)/2 = 5.5\n\nHowever, this is not an integer result because it includes a fractional component. To get an integer result, we need to round down to the nearest integer.
