To integrate a function, we need to find the derivative of the function (which tells us the rate at which the function is changing), and then subtract the constant term (which represents a constant level).\n\nTherefore, to calculate the indefinite integral of e^sin(x), we need to find the derivative of e^sin(x) (which is e^sin(x) * cos(x)), and then subtract the constant term (e^0). The indefinite integral is therefore:\n\n\u222be^sin(x) dx = e^sin(x) * cos(x) - e^0.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace 'x' with '4'.
