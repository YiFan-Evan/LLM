The integrand (1+x) is a linear function, and e^x is a exponential function. Exponential functions are generally integrated using the formula: y = x + C, where C is a constant. For linear functions, the integration is more complicated and involves substitution of variable to make it into an elementary function. To find the indefinite integral of (1+x)/e^x, we can rewrite the function as 1/e^x + x. The indefinite integral of 1/e^x is -e^(-x), and the indefinite integral of x is x. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1+x)/e^x is -e^(-x) + x + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this result, we get -e^(-4) + 4 + C. To find the final result, we need to evaluate the constant C. To do this, we need to know the method of integration used. If we used the indefinite integral, then C will be a free variable that needs to be determined by the method of integration. If we used the definite integral, then C will be a constant value that was determined by the limits of integration. However, we don't know which method was used, so we can't provide a final answer without more information.
