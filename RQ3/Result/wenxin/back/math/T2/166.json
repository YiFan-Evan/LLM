For a given function, the derivative of a function f(x) is equal to the rate of change of f(x) over a given time interval, and the indefinite integral of a function f(x) is the area under the curve of f(x) over a given range.\n\nIn this case, we need to calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x) * sin(sin(x)). Let's break it down:\n\n1. The indefinite integral of sin(x) is cos(x) because sin(x) is a periodic function that oscillates between -1 and 1, and its derivative is cos(x).\n2. The indefinite integral of sin(sin(x)) is equal to sin(x) * cos(sin(x)) because sin(sin(x)) is a composition of functions, and we need to apply the chain rule to find its derivative.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\u222bsin(x) * sin(sin(x))dx = \u222bcos(x) * sin(x) * cos(sin(x))dx = sin(x) * cos(sin(x)) - \u222bsin(x) * cos(x) * cos(sin(x))dx.\n\nNow, let's substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral. Using the formula sin(4) = 2 sin(4)/2, we get sin(4) = 1. The integrand will now be equal to (1 - cos^2(3)), where cos^2(3) is cosine squared of x, or the sum of -1 and itself (which is equal to 0).

If you replace 'x=4' in the expression 5 * (cos(4) * sin(4) * cos(sin(4))), you get 5*cos(4)*sin(4)*cos(sin(4)).
