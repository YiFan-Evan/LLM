To calculate the indefinite integral of this function, we need to use the fundamental principles of integration. The indefinite integral of a product is equal to the product of the indefinite integrals of each factor. Therefore, we need to integrate ln(x) first.\n\nThe indefinite integral of ln(x) is d(x^e), where e is the base of natural logarithms. So, the indefinite integral of 5*(ln(x)) is 5*d(x^e).\n\nNow, let's substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral. When x=4, the indefinite integral becomes 5*d(4^e), which can be simplified to 5*e^(4) - 5*e^(0) = 5*e^4.\n\nTherefore, the final result is: 20.\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of 5*(ln(x)) with x=4 is equal to 20. Note that because it's an indefinite integral, we can't take an arbitrary value for x, but for this problem, x=4 is a reasonable choice because it represents a specific value for which we're trying to find an indefinite integral."}]
