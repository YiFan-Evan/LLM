However, we can calculate it after some initial guesses or based on a given formula. For example, we can calculate it as the limit of a certain sequence of partial sums, or we can use a numerical integration method like the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule to approximate it to a specific value. In this case, the value we've calculated above is approximately equal to 0.625788733939635.\n\nIn general, if you need to find the indefinite integral of a function, you can use calculus methods like integration by parts, substitution, or integration by substitution.
