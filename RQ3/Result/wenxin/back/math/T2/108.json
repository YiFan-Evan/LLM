The indefinite integral is the sum or difference of a constant and the original function. Therefore, we can write the indefinite integral of x^2/x^2 as (1/x) * x + C, where C is a constant. To find the value of C, we can use the rule that the derivative of x^2 is 2x, which would be (2*4)/4 = 2. Therefore, the final answer is: (1/4)*4 + C = 1 + 2 = 3. Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get (1/4)*4 + C * 4 = 3 * 4 = 12.\n\nTherefore, the final result is: 12."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(x^2/x^2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of a function, we use the rules of arithmetic and the fundamental principles of calculus.
