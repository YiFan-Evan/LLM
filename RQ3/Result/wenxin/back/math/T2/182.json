Let's start by factoring the expression into the numerator and denominator. The indefinite integral would be equal to (numerator/denominator) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nThe numerator is (1 + cos(x))^2, which can be rewritten as (cos(x) + 1)^2. Now, we can use the derivative of cosine function (cos(x))' = -sin(x) to simplify the numerator further.\n\nSimplifying the numerator, we get (cos(x) + 1)^2 = (cos(x) + 1)(cos(x) + 1) = cos(x) + cos(x)^2 + 1 + cos(x) * 2.\n\nThe denominator is 2, which is constant.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of (1 + cos(x))^2 is: (cos(x) + 1 + cos(x)^2 + 2)/2.\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this expression, we get: ((cos(4) + 1) + cos(4)^2 + 2)/2 = ((cos(4) + 1) + (cos(4))^2)/2 = ((cos(4) + 1) + 1 - 1)/2 = (cos(4))/2.\n\nTo find the integer result of this expression, we need to round down to the nearest integer.
