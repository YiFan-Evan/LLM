Therefore, we can break the function into two parts: the denominator and the sine function. The denominator can be rewritten as x, so the integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(1/x) * sin(x) dx = \u222b(1/x) * sin(x) * x dx\n\nThe indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x), so we can substitute that into the integral:\n\n\u222b(-cos(x)) dx = -sin(x) + C\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n-sin(4) + C, where C is an arbitrary constant. To find the specific value of C, we need to integrate again with x=4. Using a calculator or computer program, we find that the indefinite integral of sin(4) is approximately 3.862899523796, which can be added to our result to get the final answer.
