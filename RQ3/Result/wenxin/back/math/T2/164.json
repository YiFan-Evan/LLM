The indefinite integral of ln(x) is 1/x, and the indefinite integral of x multiplied by a function is simply the product of the indefinite integral of x and the function. Therefore, the indefinite integral of x*ln(x) is x/x + ln(x).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace x with 4. So, the indefinite integral of x*ln(x) evaluated at x=4 is 4/4 + ln(4).\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down. The result of this operation is 2.
