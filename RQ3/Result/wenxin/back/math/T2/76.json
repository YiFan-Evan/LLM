The indefinite integral of a function f(x) is defined as the sum of the antiderivative of f(x) and a constant C, which is denoted as \u222bf(x)dx. Therefore, we need to find the antiderivative of x/e^x and then subtract the constant C.\n\nThe antiderivative of x/e^x can be found using the chain rule or the product rule. The chain rule states that if f(g(x)) and g(x) are functions, then the derivative of f(g(x)) with respect to x is f'(g(x))g'(x). Therefore, applying the chain rule to x/e^x, we get 1/(e^x) * -e^(-x), where the minus sign comes from the derivative of e^(-x).\n\nThe indefinite integral becomes \u222bx/e^x dx = \u222b1/(e^x) * -e^(-x) dx = -\u222be^(-x) dx = -e^(-x) + C, where C is a constant. To find the value of C, we need to integrate the expression -e^(-x) again and get 1 - e^(-x) + C, which means that C = 1.
