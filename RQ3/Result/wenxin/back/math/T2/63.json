So, the indefinite integral of x^2/e^x is equal to (x^2)'*(e^-x) - (2*x)*x^(1-x). To simplify this further, we note that e^-x is just 1/e^x and (2*x)^(1-x) = 2, which allows us to rewrite our integral as x^(2-2*x)/e^x. Now that we have this result, we need to substitute 'x=4' into it. Substituting x=4 for our variable, we get (2^4/e^(4)-8*4)/(e^(4)) = 136/e^(4)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 136/e^4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(x^2/e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of 5*(x^2/e^x), we can use the fundamental rules of integration. Since this is a product of two functions, we can integrate each function separately and multiply the results together.

This will give us the indefinite integral as 5*(x^2)*ln(e^x) - 5*(x^2) - 20*(x) - 15 = (5*x^3*ln(e^x) - 5*x^3 - 30*x - 15) * (since e^x > 0 and ln(e^x) = x for x > 0). To find the value at x=4, we need to substitute 4 for x and get (5*4^3*ln(e^4) - 5*4^3 - 30*4 - 15) / 5. Substituting e^4 = 64, we get the final result as 26. Therefore, the final answer is: 26."}]
