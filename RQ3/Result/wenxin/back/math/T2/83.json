The indefinite integral of a function f(x) is defined as the sum of the antiderivative of f(x) and the constant of integration, denoted as F(x) + C.

Since ln(4) is a natural logarithm of 4 and its value is approximately 2.06557, we can approximate F(4) as F(4) = c + (sinh(4)*2.06557).\n\nNow that we have F(4), we can find the constant of integration C by setting F(x) = 0 and solving for c.
