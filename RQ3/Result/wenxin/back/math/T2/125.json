The function sin(x) is a periodic function that oscillates between -1 and 1 as x varies. The function cos(x) is a trigonometric function that takes values between -1 and 1 as x varies. Therefore, the indefinite integral of sin(cos(x)) can be written as the indefinite integral of sin(x) with respect to x, plus the indefinite integral of x times cos(x).\n\nNow, to calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x) with respect to x, we can use the fundamental rules of integration. Integrating sin(x) with respect to x is equivalent to integrating 1/cos(x)^2, which can be simplified to ln(cos(x)) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nSimilarly, integrating x times cos(x) with respect to x is equivalent to -sin(x) + C', where C' is another constant.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of sin(cos(x)) is ln(cos(x)) - sin(x) + C, where C and C' are constants that we don't need to calculate.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace x with 4 in the expression. The result will be ln(cos(4)) - sin(4) + C, which needs to be evaluated for a specific value of C.\n\nTo find the value of C, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral of sin(x) + x^2 (where we assumed C = 0 for simplicity's sake). The result of this integration will be ln(1 - x^2) + C'', where C'' is another constant. By equating this result to the previous one, we can find the value of C: C = C'' - ln(cos(4)) + sin(4).
