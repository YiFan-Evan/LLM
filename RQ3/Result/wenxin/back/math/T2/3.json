If we want to know the exact result, we need to know the value of C.\n\nNow, let's see if we can get an approximate result. The term -5*sin(4) will result in a very large negative number. So if we approximate sin(4) by -2 (a commonly used approximation for sin(x) for x near 4\u03c0/2\u03c0), then the final result will be approximately -10.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -10.
