For an expression of the form y = x + c, the indefinite integral is y = dx. In other words, it's a direct application of the chain rule, where we can \"integrate\" or \"sum\" terms that contain a variable and constants or functions of variables. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1+x) is: (x + c)dx. Now, we can use this formula with the specific value of x = 4, so we have: ((4) + c) * dx = ((4) + c) * (dx/1).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of 5 times (1+x), we can use the fundamental rules of integration.
