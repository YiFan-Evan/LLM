Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function with respect to a variable and subtracting the constant term to obtain a new function. Therefore, we can apply the fundamental principles of integration by substituting the indefinite integral into the original function.\n\nFirst, we need to isolate the indefinite integral to find its value:\n\n\u222b(1+e^x) * ln(x)dx = \u222b(e^x + 1) * lnx * dx = (e^x * ln(x)^2/2 + e^x) + C, where C is an arbitrary constant.\n\nTo evaluate this expression, we need to substitute 'x=4'. In this case, the indefinite integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(e^4 + 1) * ln4 * 4dx = (e^4 * ln4^2/2 + e^4) + C.\n\nNow, we can substitute 'x=4' into this expression:\n\n\u222b(e^4 + 1) * ln4 * 4dx = (e^4 * ln4^2/2 + e^4) + C = (e^4 * ln4^2/2 + e^4) = e^4 * ln4 = e^4 * 4ln(4) = 64.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 64."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1+e^x)*ln(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5 times the function (1+e^x) * ln(x) is: 5 * ((e^x * ln(x)^2/2 + e^x)).\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222b5 * ((e^4 * ln4^2/2 + e^4)) = 5 * ((e^4 * ln4^2/2 + e^4)) = 5 * (e^4 * 4ln(4)) = 5 * 64 = 320.\n\nTherefore, the final result is: 320."}]
