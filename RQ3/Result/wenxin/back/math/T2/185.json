Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function and moving it in the opposite direction, thus finding the area underneath the curve.\n\nWe can rewrite the function as `(1 - sin(cos(x)))/(-cos(x))`, which makes it easier to integrate. The indefinite integral is `\u222b(1 - sin(cos(x)))/(-cos(x)) dx`.\n\nTo solve this, we need to find the derivative of the integrand function (the function inside the integral sign) with respect to x. The derivative of `sin(cos(x))` is `-cos(sin(x))` and the derivative of `-cos(x)` is `-sin(x)`. Therefore, the derivative of the integrand function is `-cos(sin(x)) * sin(x) / x^2`.\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get `\u222b(-cos(sin(4)) * sin(4) / 4^2) dx`. Now we can evaluate this integral by setting up the limits of integration and integrating from there.\n\nThe limits of integration are from 0 to 4, so we get `\u222b(-cos(sin(4)) * sin(4) / 4^2) dx = (sin(4) * cos(4) - \u222bsin(4) / 4^2 dx) / 4^2`. The second integral is a much simpler one and can be solved directly, giving us `\u222bsin(4) / 4^2 dx = 1/32 * ln(4)`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `(-sin(3) * cos(3) + 1/32 * ln(4)) / 16 = -0.078125`.\n\nNow that we have the final answer, we need to round it down to an integer.

Then, we need to find the derivative of the integrand function with respect to x, which will give us the derivative of the expression inside the integral sign.\n\nThe derivative of (-sin(cos(x)) + cos(sin(x))) with respect to x is -cos(sin(x)) + sin(cos(x)). The derivative of (-cos(x)) is -sin(x), so the derivative of the integrand function is -cos(sin(x)) * sin(x) - sin(cos(x)) * sin(x) / x^2.\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get 5*[(-sin(cos(4)) + cos(sin(4)))/(-4^2)] * x. The derivative of 4 is 4, so the final result will be 5 * [(-sin(-1) + cos(-sqrt(1-1^2/2))) / (16)] * 4.\n\nNow we can evaluate this expression by setting up the limits of integration and integrating from there.\n\nThe limits of integration are from 0 to 4, so we get 5 * [(-sqrt(1-1^2/2) + cos(-sqrt(1-1^2/2))) / (16)] * 4 = 5 * (0.7853981633974483 + cos(-2)) * 4 = 5 * (0.7853981633974483 + 0.7853981633974483) * 4 = 30.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 30.
