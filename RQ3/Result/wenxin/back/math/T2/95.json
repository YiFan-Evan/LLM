In this case, f(x) = e^x and g(x) = sin(x). The derivative of e^x is e^x, and the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x). Therefore, the indefinite integral is e^x / cos(x).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace x with 4. So, the indefinite integral of e^4/sin(4) becomes e^4 / cos(4).\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to evaluate the definite integral of this expression from 0 to 4. The indefinite integral gives us a function that needs to be integrated over a range of values to get a final result. To do this, we need to integrate e^(4-0) / cos(4-0), which is e^4 / cos(4). We can approximate this by using a trapezoidal rule or other numerical integration method. For simplicity, we can approximate it by (e^4 + e^0) / 2 * (cos(4) + cos(0)), which gives us approximately 7.779753559652693.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7.
