Integration of a fraction is equivalent to multiplication of the integral of the numerator by the integral of the denominator.\n\nTherefore, we need to integrate the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator is simply 1 divided by x, which is constant with respect to x (independent of x). Therefore, its integral is simply 1.\n\nFor the denominator, we need to integrate 1/(1+x). This can be done using the substitution u = 1 + x, which transforms the denominator into 1/u. Then, we can integrate u/u, which is just 1. After the substitution, our original function becomes 1/u^2, and its integral is -1/u^3.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the indefinite integral as -x/(x^2+1).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we simply replace x with 4 in the indefinite integral. The result is -4/25.\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down this value.
