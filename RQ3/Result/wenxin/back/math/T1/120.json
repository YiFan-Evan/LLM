The indefinite integral of a function f(x) is defined as the sum of a constant C and the derivative of f(x) with respect to x. Therefore, we need to find the derivative of cos(ln(x)) and then integrate it.\n\nThe derivative of cos(ln(x)) is -sin(ln(x)) * (1/x) * (1/lna) (assuming x > 0).\n\nNow, we need to integrate this expression. Integrating the derivative of cos(ln(x)) gives us ln(x) * sin(ln(x)) - (cos(ln(x)))^2 / (2*ln(x)) + C. However, since we are only looking for the indefinite integral, we can exclude the constant C by adding it back in at a later stage when we substitute 'x=4'.\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get ln(4) * sin(ln(4)) - (cos(ln(4)))^2 / (2*ln(4)) + some constant.\n\nTo simplify this expression further, we can use the fact that sin(ln(x)) = (x - 1)^2 / (2*x) for x > 0. Substituting this into our expression gives us ln(4) * ((4 - 1)^2 / (2*4)) - ((cos((ln(4)))^2) / (2*ln(4))) + some constant. After simplification, the final result is: 5.
