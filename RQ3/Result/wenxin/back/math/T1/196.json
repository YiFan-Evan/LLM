Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function and finding its value at a certain point.\n\nThe indefinite integral of a function is the sum of the constant term and the integral of the derivative of the function. For this particular function, we can see that the denominator is always 1, so the constant term will be 0. Therefore, we can focus on finding the integral of the derivative of the function.\n\nThe derivative of the function is (cos(x) - x*sin(x))/(cos(x)). The indefinite integral of this derivative is (x*sin(x) + cos(x))/cos(x)^2 + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we need to substitute 'x=4' into this result. We know that x=4 corresponds to the value of sin(4) and cos(4) for which we can use the standard values from math tables or calculate them using other functions. Therefore, substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral, we get:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x)/cos(x)/(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570 cos(x) / cos(x) / (1 + x)\uff0c\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b83\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u539f\u7406\u3002\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u662f\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5b83\u662f\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u5bfc\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u4ee5\u5199\u6210 cos(x) / cos(x) - x * sin(x) / cos(x)\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u5230 cos(x) / cos(x) \u662f\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b83\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a 0\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u628a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n\n\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u90e8\u5206\u662f - x * sin(x) / cos(x)\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u5e94\u8be5\u662f - x * (1 - cos(x)) / (cos(x))^2 + C\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d C \u662f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u5f53 x = 4 \u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8ff0\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4ee3\u5165\u3002\n\n\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5f97\u5230 -4 * (1 - cos(4)) / (cos(4))^2 = 2\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u5176\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6574\u6570\u5e76\u5411\u4e0b\u53d6\u6574\u5373\u53ef\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a 2\u3002"}]
