Integration is the opposite of differentiation, which means we are trying to find the area under a curve. Therefore, we need to select the correct antiderivative for x^2, which is the function 2x*x.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2*4 = 8.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we simply multiply the result by 'x' at the point we are substituting (4).
