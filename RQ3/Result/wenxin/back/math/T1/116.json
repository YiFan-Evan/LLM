The indefinite integral of a function f(x) is defined as the sum of the function and its derivative. Therefore, we can write the indefinite integral as:\n\n\u222b(1+cos(x))dx = \u222b(cos(x))dx + \u222b1dx\n\nNow, we can apply the fundamental principles of integration to solve this indefinite integral. Let's break it down:\n\n\u222bcos(x)dx = -sin(x) + C, where C is a constant. This is because cos(x) is the derivative of sin(x), and the integration of sin(x) is equal to -cos(x) + C.\n\n\u222b1dx = x + C. This is because 1 is an integrating factor, which when integrated yields x + C.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of (1+cos(x)) is: -sin(x) + x + C. Now, if we substitute 'x=4', we get the definite integral: -sin(4) + 4 + C. The value of C is unknown from this equation, so we can't calculate a final result without more information about the function. However, based on symmetry, -sin(4) is approximately -2.2537 (rounded down). Therefore, the final answer is: -2.\n\nThe correct answer is -2.
