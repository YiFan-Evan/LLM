The indefinite integral of e^x is (a + b*x) * e^x, where a and b are constants determined by the integration process. To calculate the indefinite integral of e^x, we need to integrate e^x with respect to x. The fundamental principle of integration is to add up the area under the curve of the function from a given point to infinity. Therefore, the indefinite integral of e^x is:\u222be^xdx = (e^x + C) dx.
