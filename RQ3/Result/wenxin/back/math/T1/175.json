To calculate its indefinite integral, we need to use the fundamental principles of calculus. The indefinite integral of an exponential function (e^x) is (e^x) + C, where C is a constant, and the indefinite integral of a logarithmic function ln(x) is 1/x + C. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1+e^x) * ln(x) is (1/x) + (e^x) + C.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this indefinite integral, we need to replace x with 4. So the indefinite integral becomes: 1/4 + e^4 + C.\n\nFinally, to get the integer result of the expression, we need to round down. Based on the properties of the functions involved and some elementary math operations, we can say that e^4 is very close to 25 and 1/4 is very close to 0. Therefore, the final answer is: 25.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 25."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+e^x)*ln(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(1+e^x) * ln(x) \u662f\u6307\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f (1\u52a0\u4e0a e \u7684 x \u6b21\u5e42) \u4e58\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6570\u51fd\u6570 ln(x)\u3002\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u3002\u6839\u636e\u57fa\u672c\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e e^x \u548c ln(x) \u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5206\u522b\u5f97\u5230 e^x + C \u548c 1/x + C\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u5e94\u8be5\u662f (e^x + C) * (1/x + C)\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u91cc\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5305\u542b\u5e38\u6570 C\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u9879\u5728\u79ef\u5206\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd x=4 \u65f6\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f (e^x) * (1/x)\uff0c\u5c06 x=4 \u4ee3\u5165\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a 25\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u4e3a 25\u3002"}]
