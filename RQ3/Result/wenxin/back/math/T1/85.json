Integration is the opposite of differentiation, which is used to find the derivative of a function. Therefore, to find the indefinite integral of a function, we need to multiply the function by the variable (in this case, x) and integrate it.\n\nSo, for the function x^2/x^2, we can rewrite it as 1/x. Now, we need to integrate 1/x. The indefinite integral of 1/x is ln(x) + C, where C is a constant of integration. In this case, C = 0, because we are not including it in our final expression.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ln(4).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we need to replace ln(4) with its value on the real number line. ln(4) = 1.9163275473986853. To round this number down to an integer, we take the integer part, which in this case is 2.
