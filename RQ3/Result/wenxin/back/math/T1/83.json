The indefinite integral of a function f(x) is defined as the sum of the antiderivative of f(x) and the constant of integration, denoted by F(x) + C.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the antiderivative of sinh(x) and ln(x) separately, and then multiply the results together.\n\nThe antiderivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x), and the antiderivative of ln(x) is x + 1. So, the indefinite integral of sinh(x) * ln(x) is cosh(x) * (x + 1).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace x with 4. So, the indefinite integral of sinh(4) * ln(4) is cosh(4) * (4 + 1), which equals 3 + 4cosh(4).\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down the value of cosh(4). cosh(4) is approximately 3.46563633599862, so the final result is: Therefore, the final answer is: 7.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of the function sinh(x) * ln(x) evaluated at x=4 is 7."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sinh(x)*ln(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of sinh(x) * ln(x) is cosh(x) * (x + 1).
