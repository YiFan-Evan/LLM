To calculate the indefinite integral of this function, we need to apply the fundamental principles of integration.\n\nIntegration is the process of finding the area under a curve. For this specific function, we can use the trapezoidal rule or the derivative of the sine function (cosine) to approximate the area underneath the curve.\n\nIn this case, we can approximate the area by taking the top of the curve (the positive term x^2/sin(x)) and subtracting the bottom (the negative term -x^2/sin(x)).\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral is:\n\u222b(x^2/sin(x)) = \u222b(x^2/cos(x)) - \u222b(-x^2/cos(x)) = (x^2/cos(x)) - (-x^2/cos(x)) + C\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we simply replace 'x' with 4 in the indefinite integral and replace 'C' with its constant value (if any).\n\nIn this case, since C is absent, we get:\n\u222b(4^2/cos(4)) = (4^2/(1+j))/sin(4) = 16/(1+j)\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down the final result. In this case, it would be:\nTherefore, the final answer is: 16\n\nSo, if you substitute 'x=4' into x^2/sin(x) and ignore constant C, the indefinite integral would be 16/(1+j), and rounding down gives you the integer result of 16."}, {"role": "user", "content": "x^2/sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570 x^2/sin(x)\uff0c\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u3002\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u662f\u6c42\u51fd\u6570\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u51fd\u6570\u62c6\u5206\u6210\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1ax^2 \u548c sin(x)\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e x^2\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u662f 2x*cos(x) + C\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d C \u662f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e sin(x)\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u662f cos(x)\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e x^2/sin(x)\uff0c\u5176\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u662f (2x*cos(x) + C')/cos(x)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d C' \u662f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5c06 x \u66ff\u6362\u4e3a 4\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a (2*4*cos(4) + C')/cos(4)\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5f53 x=4 \u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u503c\u4e3a (2*4*cos(4) + C')/cos(4)\uff0c\u800c\u7531\u4e8e C' \u662f\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ea\u9700\u8981\u53d6\u6574\u6570\u90e8\u5206\u5373\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5373 16\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u7b54\u6848\u662f 16\u3002"}]
