To substitute 'x=4', we need to add 4 to the result of the indefinite integral. Therefore, the final answer is: 3.\n\nExplanation: The indefinite integral of a function is the sum of the primitive function (which includes the initial condition) and the constant C. The primitive function is obtained by replacing x with an independent variable in the function expression. Substituting 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral simply means adding 4 to the result."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of cos(x) is -sin(x) + C, where C is a constant. To substitute 'x=4', we need to subtract 4 from the result of the indefinite integral. Therefore, the final answer is: -5.\n\nExplanation: The indefinite integral of a function is the derivative of its indefinite integral with respect to the independent variable. For example, the indefinite integral of cos(x) is -sin(x). Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral results in subtracting 4 from the result of the indefinite integral.\n\nPlease note that indefinite integration does not include evaluating for specific values of x. The answer given above represents a general mathematical result, and may change for different values of x."}]
