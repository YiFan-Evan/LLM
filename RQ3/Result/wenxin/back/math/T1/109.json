Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function and finding the area under its graph.\n\nThe indefinite integral of x^2/(1/x) is x^2 + C, where C is a constant. Substituting 'x=4' into this result gives 4^2 + C. Now we can use this to solve for C: 4^2 + C = x=4 value you want. Let's try this with x=4: 4^2 + C = 16 + C. Since the answer is a constant, it will only depend on the value of C, so we can simplify further: C = 16 - 4^2 = -4. Therefore, the final answer is: -4.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of x^2/(1/x) with 'x=4' is -4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "x^2/(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6211\u4eec\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0cx^2/(1/x) \u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5c31\u662f x^2 \u4e58\u4ee5 x\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f x^(2+x)\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u5b66\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u79ef\u5206\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5bf9\u5176\u5206\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5f97\u5230 x^(2+x) = x^3 + x^2 C\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d C \u662f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5c06 x \u7684\u503c\u4ee3\u5165\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u4e2d\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4ee4 x = 4\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u7ed3\u679c\u5c31\u662f 4^3 + 4^2 C = 64 + 16 C\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5b83\u53ea\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5e38\u6570 C \u7684\u503c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u4eec\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7b80\u5316\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848 -4\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u51fa\u7ed3\u8bba\uff1a\u5f53 x = 4 \u65f6\uff0cx^2/(1/x) \u7684\u79ef\u5206\u7ed3\u679c\u662f -4\u3002"}]
