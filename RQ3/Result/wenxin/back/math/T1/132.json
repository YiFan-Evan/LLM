Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function and subtracting a constant to find the area under the curve.\n\nIn this case, we need to find the area under the curve of cos(sinh(x)) from some initial point to infinity.\n\nFirst, we need to rewrite the function in terms of its derivative. Using the chain rule, we can find the derivative of cos(sinh(x)) with respect to x:\n\nd(cos(sinh(x))) = -sin(sinh(x)) * d(sinh(x))\n\nNext, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral of -sin(sinh(x)) * d(sinh(x)). This will give us the area under the curve from some initial point to infinity.\n\nTo do this, we need to use the fundamental principles of integration again. We can use the substitution u = sinh(x) to simplify the integration. This will turn our integral into an integral that we can evaluate using standard integration techniques.\n\nLet's do this substitution and evaluate the integral:\n\n\u222b(-sin(sinh(x)) * d(sinh(x))) = \u222b(-sin(u) * du)\n\nNow, we can use standard integration techniques to evaluate this integral. We know that sin(u) is an odd function, so its integral from 0 to +\u221e is 0. We also know that cos(u) is an even function, so its integral from 0 to +\u221e is \u03c0/2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \u222b(-sin(u) * du) = \u03c0/2\n\nNow that we have the indefinite integral of our function, we need to substitute 'x=4' into it. This will give us an expression that represents the area under the curve from 4 to infinity. To do this, we simply replace 'x' with '4':\n\n\u222b(-sin(sinh(4)) * d(sinh(4))) = \u03c0/2 + C\n\nFinally, we need to find the integer result of this expression by rounding down. To do this, we simply take the integer part of \u03c0/2 + C:\n\n\u03c0/2 + C = 1 + C\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1\n\nTherefore, when substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral of cos(sinh(x)), the expression is \u03c0/2 + C and its integer result is 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(sinh(x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u60a8\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u662f\uff1acos(sinh(x))\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u590d\u5408\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7531\u5185\u5c42\u51fd\u6570sinh\u548c\u5916\u5c42\u51fd\u6570cos\u6784\u6210\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u590d\u5408\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u94fe\u5f0f\u6cd5\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u5bfc\u3002\n\n\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u5047\u8bbex\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9sinh(x)\u6c42\u5bfc\u5f97\u5230\u5176\u5bfc\u6570d(sinh(x)) = cosh(x) * (1 + sinh(x)^2)^(-1/2)\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u518d\u5bf9cos(d(sinh(x)))\u6c42\u5bfc\uff0c\u5f97\u5230cos(sinh(x))\u7684\u5bfc\u6570d(cos(sinh(x))) = -sinh(sinh(x)) * d(sinh(x))\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u6c42\u5bfc\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u662f\u7528\u6765\u6c42\u89e3\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u53ca\u5176\u539f\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u6216\u53cd\u51fd\u6570\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9996\u5148\u8981\u627e\u5230\u539f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u624d\u80fd\u5c06\u5176\u4ee3\u5165\u5230\u6c42\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u662f\u6c42\u89e3\u53cd\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u9006\u8fd0\u7b97\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u5b9a\u7684\u6280\u5de7\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e9b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u6362\u5143\u6cd5\u6216\u8005\u5229\u7528\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002\u4f46\u662f\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u6280\u5de7\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4e8e\u521d\u5b66\u8005\u6765\u8bf4\u53ef\u80fd\u6bd4\u8f83\u56f0\u96be\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u53ea\u662f\u60f3\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u503cx=4\u65f6\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0a\u9762\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u516c\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u4f46\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u5e76\u5728x=4\u65f6\u53d6\u503c\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e86\u3002"}]
