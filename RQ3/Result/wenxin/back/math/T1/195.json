The indefinite integral of a function f(x) is defined as the derivative of its indefinite integral, which is equal to the sum of the constant term C and the function itself. Therefore, we can rewrite the function as:\n\n\u222b(sinh(x)/sinh(x)*(1/x))dx = \u222b(1/x)dx - \u222b(sinh(x)/x)dx\n\nNow, we can calculate each integral separately. The indefinite integral of 1/x is equal to ln(x) + C, where C is a constant. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (sinh(x)/sinh(x)*(1/x)) is equal to ln(sinh(x)) + C.\n\nTo find the constant term C, we need to integrate the term sin(x)/x again. This time, we can use the fundamental principles of calculus to find that the indefinite integral of sin(x)/x is equal to cos(x) + C. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (sinh(x)/sinh(x)*(1/x)) is equal to ln(sinh(x)) + cos(x) + C.\n\nFinally, to find the final result of the indefinite integral of x=4, we need to substitute x=4 into the expression and simplify. The final result is: ln(sinh(4)) + cos(4). To find the integer result, we need to round down the result.
