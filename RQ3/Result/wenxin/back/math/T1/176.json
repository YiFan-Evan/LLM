It is a product of two terms. The indefinite integral of this function is the sum of the integral of each term. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (x + 1) * x is (x^2 + x) + C, where C is a constant. To substitute 'x=4', we need to evaluate the indefinite integral with 'x=4' and add it to C. The result will be a new constant. To find the integer result, we need to round down this constant. The indefinite integral with 'x=4' will give a result of 35.
