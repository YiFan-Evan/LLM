To find the value of C, you need to substitute 'x=4' into the expression. Substituting 'x=4' into the expression gives:\n\n\u222bsin(4)dx = -cos(4) + C.\n\nNow, you can simply solve for C by setting the right-hand side of the equation to zero and moving the constant of integration to the left-hand side:\n\nC = \u222bsin(4)dx + C.\n\nBy simplifying and rearranging, you can solve for C and find that it is equal to -sin(4). Since you need an integer result, you can round down by simply taking the absolute value of -sin(4), which gives -5.
