Integration is the process of taking the area under a curve from a given point to infinity. Therefore, we need to find the area under the curve of the function x^2*(1+x) from a given point (x=0) to infinity.\n\nTo do this, we can use the formula for indefinite integral: F(x) = x + C, where F(x) is the indefinite integral of the function, and C is a constant. We need to find F(x^2*(1+x)) = x^3 + x^2*(1+x) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTo solve the problem for a specific value of x (4), we substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral. We get F(4^2*(1+4)) = 4^3 + 4^2*(1+4) + C = 64 + 64 + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 128 + C. Since we don't know the value of C, we can't provide a specific integer result.
