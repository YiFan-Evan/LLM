To calculate the indefinite integral of ln(x), we need to use the fundamental principles of integration. The indefinite integral of ln(x) is equal to d(x^e), where e is the base of natural logarithms. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4^e\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we need to replace e with its value for x=4. We know that e^4 \u2248 8.5, so the final expression is approximately equal to 4^8.
