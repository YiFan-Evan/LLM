For this specific function, we can use integration by parts, which is a common technique for finding indefinite integrals.\n\nWe start by finding the derivative of the function:\n\nf(x) = cos(x) * x^2 / e^x\n\nLet's differentiate this function first:\n\ndf(x) = (x^2 * sin(x) - 2x * cos(x) * e^x) / e^x\n\nNow we can integrate the derivative to find the indefinite integral:\n\n\u222b f(x) dx = \u222b (x^2 * sin(x) - 2x * cos(x) * e^x) / e^x dx\n= ( - x^2 * cos(x) + 2x * sin(x) + C) + C'\n\nNow, we need to substitute 'x=4' into this result. Substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we get:\n\n\u222b ( - 4^2 * cos(4) + 2 * 4 * sin(4) + C) + C' dx\n= ( - 64 * cos(4) + 8 * sin(4)) + C'\n\nTo find the final result, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral with 'C' and 'C''. To do this, we need to know what values 'C' and 'C'' were originally set to. Since these are constants, they don't change based on the evaluation. Typically, you would have to integrate some initial value problem or find it from the original problem statement. Since you didn't provide this information, I'm going to use the default value 'C = 0', which gives us:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -64 * cos(4) + 8 * sin(4).\n\nThe result is a single integer number representing the final result. To simplify the result, we need to round down to the nearest integer.
