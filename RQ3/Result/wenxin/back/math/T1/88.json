Integration is the process of finding the area under a curve. To calculate the indefinite integral, we need to find the derivative of the function (which is the rate of change of the curve) and then multiply it by a constant (which is usually denoted by C).\n\nSo, let's do it! The indefinite integral of sinh(x)*x is:\n\n\u222b sinh(x)*x dx = \u222b sinh(x) dx * x.\n\nTo calculate this, we need to take the derivative of sinh(x) (which is its derivative, which is cosh(x)) and multiply it by x. We also need to remember that sin(x) and cosh(x) are related to each other through hyperbolic functions, so we can use this relationship to simplify our calculations.\n\n\u222b sinh(x) dx = cosh(x) - 1, which we will use in our next step.\n\nSo, putting all this together, we get:\n\n\u222b (cosh(x) - 1) * x dx = cosh(x) * x^2/2 - x + C.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we simply need to replace x with 4 in our expression:\n\n\u222b (cosh(4) - 1) * 4 dx = cosh(4) * 4^2/2 - 4 + C.\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down. The final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 19.\n\nRemember that the constant C is usually arbitrary, so you can replace it with any value you like (e.g., 0).
