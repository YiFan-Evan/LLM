Integration is the process of taking the derivative of the opposite of the function. Therefore, we need to take the derivative of the denominator and then multiply it by the integrand.\n\nThe derivative of (1/x) is -1/x^2, and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x). So, the indefinite integral becomes: (1/x^2) * sin(x) + C, where C is an integration constant that we can ignore for our problem.\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into this result, we get: (-1/4^2) * sin(4) = -sin(4)/16. However, to simplify this further, we need to know the value of sin(4). We can use the definition of sin(x) = cos(x-\u03c0/2) to approximate it using cosine values. Since 4 is close to 0, we can approximate sin(4) with cos(4-\u03c0/2) = cos(-\u03c0/2) = 0. Therefore, the final answer is: -sin(4)/16 = 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0."}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1/x)/cos(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of (1/x)/cos(x) is (1/x^2) * sin(x) + C, where C is an integration constant that can be ignored for our problem.
