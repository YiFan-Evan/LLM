The indefinite integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C, where C is a constant. However, to find the value of x=4, we need to integrate with respect to x, so we need to substitute x=4 into the result of the indefinite integral. The indefinite integral becomes ln|4| + C. After evaluating this integral, we find that the result is 2.
