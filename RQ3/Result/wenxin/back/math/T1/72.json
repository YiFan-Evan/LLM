Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function and finding the area under its graph. Therefore, we need to separate the function into its two parts: e^x and 1/x.\n\nThe indefinite integral of e^x is e^x, so the first term becomes e^4.\n\nFor the second term, 1/x, we need to consider the behavior of 1/x when x approaches zero. When x is close to zero, 1/x will become infinity, so we need to take this into account in our integration. For now, we will treat x=4 as a constant and ignore its derivative.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: e^4 * ln(x) + C, where C is a constant that needs to be determined by integrating again with respect to x. To find C, we need to integrate e^4 * ln(x) again with respect to x and get C = -2. Therefore, the final result is: e^4 * ln(4) - 2.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we simply replace 'x' with 4 in the expression e^4 * ln(4) - 2. The result is: 28.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 28."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x*(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570 e^x*(1/x)\uff0c\u5176\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u9700\u8981\u5c06 e^x \u548c 1/x \u5206\u522b\u6c42\u79ef\u5206\u3002e^x \u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u662f e^x\uff0c\u800c 1/x \u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u5728 x=4 \u65f6\u8d8b\u5411\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u67d0\u79cd\u6280\u5de7\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6765\u5904\u7406\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u6765\u8bf4\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06 x=4 \u770b\u4f5c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u5176\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570 e^x*(1/x)\uff0c\u5176\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a e^x * ln(x) + C\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d C \u4e3a\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u5b9a C\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u518d\u6b21\u6c42\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u8fd9\u6b21\u662f\u6c42 e^x * ln(x) \u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230 C = -2\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u5f53 x=4 \u65f6\uff0c\u51fd\u6570 e^x*(1/x) \u7684\u503c\u4e3a e^4 * ln(4) - 2\u3002\u5c06 ln(4) \u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e3a 1.3862943611\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a 28\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u51fd\u6570 e^x*(1/x) \u5f53 x=4 \u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u503c\u4e3a 28\u3002"}]
