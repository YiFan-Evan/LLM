To calculate the indefinite integral of this function, we need to use the fundamental principles of integration. Integration is the process of finding the area under a curve, and to do this we need to use the fundamental rules of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nFirstly, we need to separate the functions into their individual parts. The function you provided can be written as:\n\n\n```scss\nsinh(1 + x) * sinh(x)\n```\nNow, we can apply the fundamental rules of integration to each part of the function. For the first part, we can use the integration formula for hyperbolic functions:\n\n\u222bsinh(x) dx = -cosh(x) + C\n\nFor the second part, we can use the product rule for integration:\n\n\u222bsinh(1 + x) * sinh(x) dx = \u222bsinh(1 + x) d(sinh(x)) + \u222bsinh(x) d(sinh(1 + x))\n\nSimplifying the first integral and applying the above formula gives:\n\n\u222bsinh(1 + x) d(sinh(x)) = \u222b(cosh(1 + x) - 1) dsinh(x) = (cosh(1 + x) * sinh(x) - sinh(x)) - C\n\nNow, to simplify the second integral, we can use the chain rule for integration:\n\n\u222bsinh(x) d(sinh(1 + x)) = \u222bsinh(x) * (d(cosh(1 + x)) / dx) dx = (cosh(1 + x) - x) / 2 - C\n\nFinally, we can add the two constants together to get the indefinite integral of the entire function:\n\n\u222bsinh(1 + x) * sinh(x) dx = (cosh(1 + x) * sinh(x) - sinh(x)) - (cosh(1 + x) - x) / 2\n\nNow that we have the indefinite integral, we need to substitute 'x=4' into it. Plugging in 'x=4' into the formula gives:\n\n\u222bsinh(5) * sinh(4) dx = (cosh(5 + 4) * sinh(4) - sinh(4)) - (cosh(5 + 4) - 4) / 2\n\nSimplifying this expression gives:\n\n\u222bsinh(5) * sinh(4) dx = (cosh(9) * sinh(4)) / 2 - 7\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -7."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sinh((1+x))*sinh(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570sinh((1+x))*sinh(x)\uff0c\u5176\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u79ef\u5206\u516c\u5f0f\u548c\u94fe\u5f0f\u6cd5\u5219\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u51fd\u6570\u62c6\u5206\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\uff1asinh(1+x)\u548csinh(x)\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8esinh(1+x)\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u672c\u79ef\u5206\u516c\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5f97\u5230-cosh(1+x)\u52a0\u4e0a\u5e38\u6570C\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8esinh(x)\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u94fe\u5f0f\u6cd5\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u79ef\u5206\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u52a0\u5373\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u3002\n\n\u5c06x=4\u4ee3\u5165\u4e0a\u8ff0\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f97\u5230\uff1a\n\n\u222bsinh(5)*sinh(4) dx = (cosh(9)*sinh(4)) / 2 - 7\n\n\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\uff1a-7\u3002"}]
