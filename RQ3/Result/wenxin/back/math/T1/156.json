The indefinite integral of a function f(x) is defined as the derivative of its integral with respect to x, i.e., F(x) = integral(f(x)) = f(x) + constant, where constant is the integration constant.\n\nIn this case, we can apply this definition by substituting the function expression into the formula for indefinite integration.
