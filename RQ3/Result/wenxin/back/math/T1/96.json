Integration is the process of taking the sum of the reciprocal of an infinite number of equal but opposite portions of a certain variable. For example, for a certain function like f(x) = cos(x^2), if we integrate with respect to x, we will be calculating the sum of the area underneath the curve of the function f(x) as a function of x.\n\nTherefore, for the function cos(x^2), the indefinite integral is:\n\n\u222bcos(x^2)dx = -sin(x^2) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we need to multiply the result by -1 and then multiply by the value of x=4. So, (-sin(4^2)) * 4 = -sin(16) * 4 = -sin(5.14) * 4 = -sin(5) * 4 = -2sin(5/2) = -2*0.8775 = -1.75.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -1.75."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x^2)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u51fd\u6570cos(x^2)\uff0c\u5b83\u7684\u4e0d\u5b9a\u79ef\u5206\u662f-sin(x^2)+C\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dC\u662f\u5e38\u6570\u3002\u5c06x=4\u4ee3\u5165\u8fd9\u4e2a\u79ef\u5206\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u662f-sin(4^2)+C\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u7b80\u5316\u5e76\u53d6\u6574\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97-sin(4^2)\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5373-sin(16)\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e2a\u503c\u4e58\u4ee54\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a-sin(16) * 4 = -sin(5.14) * 4 = -sin(5) * 4 = -2sin(5/2) = -2*0.8775 = -1.75\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u662f-1.75\u3002"}]
