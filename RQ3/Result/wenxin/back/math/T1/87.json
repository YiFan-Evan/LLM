The indefinite integral calculates the value of the function over an infinite range of variables, without specifying the specific values. Therefore, we need to use the derivative of the function cos(ln(x)) to find its indefinite integral.\n\nThe derivative of the function cos(ln(x)) is sin(ln(x)). Therefore, the indefinite integral of the function is -sin(ln(x)).\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we need to multiply the result by 4. The indefinite integral of cos(ln(x)) evaluated at x=4 is -sin(ln(4)).
