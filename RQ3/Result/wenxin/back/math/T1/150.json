The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x, and the indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x). Therefore, the indefinite integral of e^x*sin(x) is e^x * (-cos(x)) + C, where C is a constant. To substitute 'x=4', we simply replace x with 4 in the indefinite integral, which gives us e^4 * (-cos(4)) + C. To find the integer result, we need to evaluate the expression e^4 * (-cos(4)) by rounding down. Using the properties of trigonometric functions and the properties of exponents, we can simplify the expression to get e^(-8) * (-1)^4.
