Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function and solving for a new function that is a sum of constants and a constant of integration.\n\nIn this case, we need to integrate the function x/(1+x). This function is in the form of a quotient, so we can use the fundamental theorem of calculus to solve for its indefinite integral.\n\nThe indefinite integral of x/(1+x) is equal to -1/(1+x)^2 + C, where C is a constant of integration. To find the value of C, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral at a particular value of x.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n(The indefinite integral of x/(1+x) at x=4 is -((4/5)*4^(2)) + C, where C is a constant that cannot be evaluated from the given information. The value of C will depend on the method used to approximate it.)\n\nThe result after substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral is not an integer, so it cannot be represented as an integer result.
