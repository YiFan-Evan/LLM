Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function and then subtracting a constant, which in this case is zero because we are only considering the indefinite integral.\n\nThe indefinite integral of sin(x) * sinh(x) is:\n\n\u222bsin(x) * sinh(x) dx = \u222bsin(x) * (e^x + c) dx\n\nNow, we can use the fundamental properties of the sine and hyperbolic sine functions to simplify the expression. We know that sin(x) = -cos(\u03c0 - x), and sinh(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / 2. Therefore, we can rewrite the integral as:\n\n\u222b(-cos(\u03c0 - x) * (e^x + c)) dx + c'\n\nWe can simplify this further by realizing that e^x + c is a constant of integration that can be dropped, leaving us with:\n\n\u222b(-cos(\u03c0 - x)) dx = \u222bsin(\u03c0 - x) dx\n\nFinally, we can integrate the remaining part again to find the indefinite integral:\n\n\u222bsin(\u03c0 - x) dx = -cos(\u03c0 - x) + C'\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0.\n\nNow that we have the indefinite integral, we need to substitute 'x=4' into it. This gives us: -cos(\u03c0 - 4) = -cos(4\u03c0 - 4). Using basic trigonometry, we know that cos(4\u03c0-4) = cos(-4) = cos4. Therefore, the final result is: -1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "sin(x)*sinh(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u6570\u5b66\u6cd5\u5219\uff0csin(x) * sinh(x)\u7b49\u4e8e\u6b63\u5f26\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u53cc\u66f2\u6b63\u5f26\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e58\u79ef\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u4f3c\u4e4e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u7ed9\u51fax\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4e3a\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u3002\u5982\u679c\u60a8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u6211\u5c06\u5f88\u4e50\u610f\u5e2e\u52a9\u60a8\u3002"}]
