Integration is the process of taking the derivative of the opposite of the integrand (the function) with respect to the variable of integration. Therefore, we need to take the derivative of the denominator with respect to x, and then integrate it.\n\nThe derivative of x^2/ln(x) with respect to x is 2x/ln(x) - 1/ln(x).\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of x^2/ln(x) is 2x + C, where C is a constant.\n\nNow, we need to substitute 'x=4' into this result. So, we have 2*4 + C = 8 + C.\n\nFinally, we need to round down the result to get an integer.
