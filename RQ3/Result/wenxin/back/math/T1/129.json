To calculate the indefinite integral of this function, we need to use the integration rules for trigonometric functions. Integration of a square root function can be expressed as the sum of an exponential function and a constant term. Therefore, the indefinite integral of cos(x)^2 is (1/2)cos(x) + C, where C is a constant term. Now, if we substitute 'x=4' into this result, we get the definite integral of cos(4). To calculate this, we need to evaluate the integrand at 'x=4' and add the constant term C.
