Integration is the process of finding the area under a curve, and to do this we need to multiply the derivative (the slope of the curve at a given point) by a constant (the integration constant).\n\nTherefore, we need to find the derivative of the function and then multiply it by the integration constant. The derivative of x^2*(1+x) is 2*x*(1+x) + x^2.\n\nNow, to find the integration constant, we need to integrate this derivative. The indefinite integral is 2*x*(1+x) + x^2 + C, where C is an integration constant.\n\nTo substitute 'x=4', we need to add 4^2 + 4*C. Therefore, the final answer is: 2*4*(1+4) + 4^2 + C = 36 + 16 + C = 52 + C.\n\nNow, to find the integer result of the expression, we need to round down the floating-point number C to the nearest integer.
