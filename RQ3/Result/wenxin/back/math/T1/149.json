Integration is the process of taking the derivative of the reciprocal of a function, which in this case is cos(x). Therefore, the indefinite integral is sin(x)/x^2.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we need to multiply by 4^2, giving us the definite integral sin(4)/4^2. Now we can take the derivative of this result to find the actual function value at x=4. Taking the derivative of the integral (which is just the limit of the derivative of the function as x approaches 4) gives us -cos(4). Therefore, the final answer is: -cos(4).\n\nSince cos(4) is approximately -0.7395734651593738, the final result is -7395734651593738."}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x)/x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of the function cos(x)/x is equal to sin(x)/x^2.
