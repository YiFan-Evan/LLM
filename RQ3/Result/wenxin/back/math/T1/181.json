However, the expression e^x^2 does not contain a constant C, so there is no constant to be substituted. Therefore, we can't find a definite integral for this function because we need the value of x to be integrated. If we substitute 'x=4' into this indefinite integral, we can calculate the indefinite integral of e^(4^2) = e^16. This will result in a value of approximately 23.7875.
