We have a constant (1+x), a term involving x^2 squared, and another term involving x^4 raised to the power of x. Let's use the method of partial fractions to simplify this.\n\nThe indefinite integral of (1+x) is simply 1 + x*d(x), where d(x) is the derivative of x. The indefinite integral of x^2 is 2*x*d(x) - x^2/2, and the indefinite integral of x^4 raised to the power of x is just x^4*(x*d(x)).\n\nTherefore, putting these parts together, we have the indefinite integral:\n\n\u222b(1+x) * x^2 * x^4 dx = \u222b(1 + 2*x^3 + (1/2)*x^6)*dx\n\nNext, we use integration by parts (IBP) to simplify this. We choose u=x^3 and dv=(1/6)*x^6 + (1/2)*x*dx, so that du = (3/6)*x^2 + (1/3)*dx and the original integral becomes:\n\n\u222b(u*dv) = v*u - \u222b(u*du)\n\n= (3/6)*\u222b(x^3)^2 dx + (1/3)*\u222b(3*x^3)*dx\n\n= (1/6)*(1/2)*x^(5)*sqrt(\u03c0)-3/2*(3/5)*\u222bx^(5)*dx\n\nTo solve the remaining integral, we can use another form of integration by parts using u=x^(5). Choose dv=(1/5)*ln(x)+c to find the constant of integration. Now we have:\n\n\u222b(u*dv) = v*u - \u222b(dv*u) = (ln(x)+c)*(5/5)*\u222bx^(5)*dx\n\n= (ln(x)+c)*(5/5)*(1/6)*(1/2)*x^(5)*sqrt(\u03c0)-3*(5/7)*\u222bx^(5) dx\n\n= (ln(4)+c)*(5/7)*(1/6)*(1/2)*(4)^(5)*sqrt(\u03c0)-3*(5/7)*(3/5)*(\u222bx^(5)*dx)\n\nNow we can substitute 'x=4' into this expression and find the final result:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8087\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a8087\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)*x^2*x^2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97(1+x)x^2x^2\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5b83\u62c6\u6210\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u6bcf\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u5bfc\uff1a\u539f\u51fd\u6570\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u8fd9\u91cc\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e00\u6b21\u51fd\u6570\uff09+\u4e24\u500d\u7684x\u90e8\u5206\u5bf9x\u7684\u6c42\u5bfc*\u4e24\u500d\u7684x\u5e73\u65b9\uff08\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u9636\u5bfc\uff09+\u4e24\u4e2ax\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u9898\u76ee\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u8868\u8fbe\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u672a\u5b8c\u6210\u54e6\n\n(1+x)*x^2*x^2\u7684\u5bfc\u6570= (2x*x^2+2*x^3)*x^2+2*x*(2*x^3)\n\n= (2*x^3+2*x^5)*x^2+4*x^3\n\n= (2*4^3+2*4^5)*4^2+4*4^3\n\n\u2248 4096\n\n\u6240\u4ee5(1+x)*x^2*x^2\u7684\u5bfc\u6570\u5927\u7ea6\u4e3a4096\u3002\n\n\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7b54\u6848\u53ea\u662f\u6839\u636e\u5df2\u77e5\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63a8\u7b97\uff0c\u5b8c\u6574\u7b54\u6848\u9700\u8981\u7ee7\u7eed\u6c42\u5bfc\u6700\u540e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u6570\u3002"}]
