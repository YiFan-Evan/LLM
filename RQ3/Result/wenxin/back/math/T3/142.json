First, we need to understand what sinh(x) and sin(x) mean. sinh(x) is the hyperbolic sine function, which is a trigonometric function that produces a value between -1 and 1 when x is between -\u221e and \u221e. sin(x) is the standard sine function, which produces a value between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2 for any real number x.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of sin(sinh(x)) can be expressed as:\u222bsin(sinh(x))dx.\n\nNow, we can use the fundamental principles of integration to solve this problem. Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function with respect to a variable, and it's done by using the definite integral of a function with a given limit of integration.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the indefinite integral of sin(sinh(x)) with respect to x, and then find the value of x that corresponds to the definite integral. To find the indefinite integral, we need to substitute sinh(x) = u and solve for du (dsinh(x))/dx = sin(u), dx/dx = 1/cos(u). This results in the expression:\u222b(sin(u))/cos(u)udu = -\u222bsec^2(u)du.\n\nThe final answer is: ln(|sec(u)| + 1) + C, where C is a constant. To find the value of x that corresponds to this indefinite integral, we need to evaluate it with a given x value. To find the value of x=4, we can substitute 4 for u in the expression, resulting in ln(|sec(4)| + 1).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3.\n\nPlease note that this answer assumes that the hyperbolic sine function is defined for all real numbers x, which is not always true.
