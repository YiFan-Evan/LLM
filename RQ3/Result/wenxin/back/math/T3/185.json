Therefore, we need to break down the function into its individual terms and apply the rules of integration to each term.\n\nFirst, we need to rewrite the function as cos(x)/sin(x) = tan(x) - 1. Then, we can apply the indefinite integration rules to each term individually. For the term tan(x), we can use the indefinite integral formula: \u222btan(x)dx = (1/sec(x)) + C, where C is a constant. For the term -1, we can simply ignore it because it is a constant.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of the function is (tan(x) - 1)/sin(x). Now, we need to substitute 'x=4' into this result. Substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral gives us (tan(4) - 1)/sin(4). Finally, we need to evaluate this expression to find the integer result. To do this, we need to multiply by -cos(4) because sin(4) = cos(4 - \u03c0/2) = -cos(4).
