Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function and evaluating it from a certain point to infinity. For this problem, we can break down the function into two parts: x and 1/x.\n\nThe indefinite integral of x is simply x, so we can write the function as:\n\n\u222b(x/(1/x))dx = \u222bxd(1/x) = x * (1/x) + C, where C is a constant that cancels out when we take the derivative again.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: x * (1/x)\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we simply need to replace x with 4 in the indefinite integral.
