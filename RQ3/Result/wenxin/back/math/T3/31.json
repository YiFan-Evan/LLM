To find the integer result of the expression after substituting 'x=4', we need to evaluate the constant C. The indefinite integral gives us the graph of the function above the x-axis, so the constant C is determined by the constants in the initial function (cos(4)). To find C, we can plug in x=4 for x in the cos function, get the corresponding y value, and then add this y value to -sin(4). This will give us the constant C. In this case, the y value of cos(4) is 0.9973822233635, so we have C=-sin(4)+y value of cos(4)=-0.802617776637.
