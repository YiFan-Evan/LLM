To find the result at x = 4, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result: \u222bsinh(4)/4dx = -cosh(4) + C. The indefinite integral cannot be evaluated directly because cosh(4) is undefined at x = 4.

The indefinite integral cannot be evaluated directly because cosh(4) is undefined at x = 4. However, we can use the definition of cosh(x) to approximate the result by replacing x with a nearby value such as 3. Then we can calculate the definite integral from some initial value to x = 4 and approximate the value of C using a numerical method such as Newton's method.\n\nTherefore, the final answer after rounding down is: The indefinite integral of (sinh(x)/x+x) evaluated at x = 4 is approximately equal to (cosh(3) + 16)/2 + C, where C is approximately equal to 15.
