To calculate the indefinite integral of this function, we need to use the fundamental principles of integration.\n\nIntegration is the process of finding the area under a curve. To integrate a function, we need to use the integration formulas that depend on the type of function. For example, for functions like e^x or cos(x), we can use the substitution method.\n\nIn this case, we can use the substitution u = cos(x) because it transforms the original function into a simpler one. After this substitution, we can use the integration formula for u and then take the exponential back.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of e^cos(x) is:\n\n\u222be^u du = e^u + C\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into this result, we need to replace u with cos(4). After this substitution, we get:\n\n\u222be^(cos(x)) dx = e^(cos(4)) + C\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down the expression in parentheses (e^(cos(4))).
