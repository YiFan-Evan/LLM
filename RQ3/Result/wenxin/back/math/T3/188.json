First, we need to isolate the denominator term, which can be done by subtracting `e^x` from both sides: `cos(x) * x^2 = Rational(1, 2) * x * (x - 2*I*sin(x)) / e^x`. Then, we can use the substitution `u = x - 2*I*sin(x)` to simplify the integral: `u = x - 2*I*sin(x) -> du = -2*I*cos(x) * dx`. Integrating both sides, we get `Rational(1, 2) * x * (x - 2*I*sin(x)) = (1/2) * I * e^u` or `Rational(1, 2) * x^2 - Rational(1, 2) * I * x * cos(x) = (1/2) * e^u * sin(u)` where `u` is a new variable. The indefinite integral is now in terms of `u`, so we can integrate it again to get `ln|e^(u)| + C = (1/2) * ln|sin(u)| + C` where `C` is an integration constant. To find the value of `C`, we need to evaluate the integral at `x = 4`. This gives us `ln|e^(4 - 2*I*sin(4))| + C = (1/2) * ln|sin(4 - 4*sin(4))| + C`. Evaluating at `sin(4) = cos(4) = Rational(1, 3)` gives us `C = 3`. Therefore, the final answer is: `The indefinite integral of the function cos(x) * x^2 / e^x is Rational(1, 6) * ln|sin(x)| + Rational(5, 6)` and when `x = 4`, the result is `Rational(5, 6)` rounded down."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: cos(x)*x^2/e^x+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of the function `cos(x) * x^2 / e^x + x`, we can use the fundamental principles of integration.
