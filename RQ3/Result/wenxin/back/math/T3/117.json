The indefinite integral of a product of two functions is the sum of the indefinite integrals of each function times the other. So, we can separate the function into two parts: cos(x) and x, and integrate each part separately.\n\nCosine function is an odd function, so its indefinite integral is zero. Therefore, the indefinite integral of cos(x) is 0.\n\nFor the other part, x, it's an elementary function, so its indefinite integral is x itself.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of cos(x) * x is: 0 * x + x * C, where C is an integration constant that we don't need to calculate.\n\nTo substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, we simply replace x with 4: 0 * 4 + 4 * C.\n\nThe final answer is: 8.
