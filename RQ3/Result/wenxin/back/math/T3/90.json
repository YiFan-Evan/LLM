The indefinite integral would be:\n\n\u222bsin(ln(x)) + x dx = \u222bsin(ln(x)) dx + \u222bxdx\n\nNow, we need to evaluate these two integrations. For the first integral, we need to use the fundamental principles of integration again. The derivative of sin(ln(x)) is -cos(ln(x)). So, we would get -cos(ln(x)) + c1 for the indefinite integral.\n\nFor the second integral, it's a simple integration: x dx = d(x^2)/2. So, the indefinite integral would be d(x^2)/2 + c2.\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4' into these results, we simply replace x with 4 in each case. The result would be:\n\n-cos(ln(4)) + c1 + (4^2)/2 + c2\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down the result. This will depend on what values c1 and c2 take. If they are integers, then you will get an integer result after rounding down.
