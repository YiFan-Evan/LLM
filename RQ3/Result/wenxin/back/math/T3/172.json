The fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that the indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C, where C is a constant. Therefore, the indefinite integral of e^x is e^x.\n\nNow, we can apply this to the other term in the expression. The indefinite integral of x*e^x is x*e^x + C. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1+x)*e^x dx is e^x + x*e^x + C.\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into this result, we get:\n\n\u222b(1+4)*e^(4) dx = e^(4) + 4*e^(4) + C\n\nThe constant C can be set to zero for now. We're only interested in the indefinite integral. So, we get:\n\ne^(4) + 4*e^(4) = 5*e^(4)\n\nFinally, to get an integer result, we need to round down the decimal to an integer. In this case, 5.0973 rounded down to 5. Therefore, the final answer is: 5.\n\nThe expression has been simplified as much as possible using only mathematical principles and is now in its simplest form possible.

The reason for this is that we can apply the fundamental theorem of calculus to rewrite the integral as a function of x plus an arbitrary constant. Since we know the derivative of e^x (e^x dx) = e^x + C, where C is a constant, we can replace the integral with e^x + C + x. Substituting x=4 into this expression gives us 1 + 4 + x, which when rounded down to an integer is 5. Therefore, the final answer is 5."}]
