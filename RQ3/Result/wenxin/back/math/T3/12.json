The indefinite integral of x^2 + x is the area under the curve of (x^2 + x) from any given point to infinity. To find this area, we need to integrate the function over the x-axis.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: x(x+1) + C, where C is a constant. To exclude the constant C, we need to take out the constant term and simplify further. We get: x^2 + x + C_0, where C_0 is a new constant.\n\nNow, if we substitute 'x=4' into the indefinite integral result, we get 4^2 + 4 + C_0 = 17 + C_0. This result is still an expression, so we need to find a way to simplify it further. However, for this particular problem, we don't have enough information to determine C_0, so we can't provide a final answer. If we had more information about the function or the integration limits, we could provide a more accurate answer."}]
