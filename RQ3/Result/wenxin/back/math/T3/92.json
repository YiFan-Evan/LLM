Integration is the process of finding the area under a curve. To integrate a function, we need to multiply the function by the derivative of the function (i.e., the inverse of the original function) and then integrate that product.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the derivative of (1+ln(x)) first. The derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, so the derivative of (1+ln(x)) is 1 + 1/x. Now, we can use this derivative to multiply (1+ln(x)) and integrate the product to find the indefinite integral.\n\nThe indefinite integral of (1+ln(x)) is 1/x + C, where C is a constant. To find the value of x=4, we need to substitute 4 for x in the indefinite integral. The result is 4 + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+ln(x))+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of (1+ln(x))+x, we can follow the same principles as before. The indefinite integral of a sum of functions is equal to the sum of the indefinite integrals of the individual functions.\n\nTherefore, we need to find the indefinite integral of 1+ln(x) and x separately, and then add them together.\n\nThe indefinite integral of 1+ln(x) is 1/x + C, where C is a constant.\n\nThe indefinite integral of x is simply x, because x is a constant function.\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of (1+ln(x))+x is (1/x + C) + x = (1+x)/x + C.\n\nTo find the value of x=4, we need to substitute 4 for x in the indefinite integral. The result is 5 + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5. Please note that this answer assumes that the constant C is zero, which is a common convention in calculus. If you are given a different value for C, you would need to adjust the answer accordingly."}]
