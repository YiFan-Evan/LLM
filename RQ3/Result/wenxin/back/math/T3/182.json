To calculate its indefinite integral, we need to integrate the term (1+cos(x)) with respect to x. Using the fundamental principles of integration, we can break it down into two parts: the constant 1 and the cosine function. The constant 1 is a constant value that does not change with respect to x, so it can be integrated directly.

To calculate its indefinite integral, we need to integrate the term (1+cos(x))^2 with respect to x and then add the constant term x. Using the fundamental principles of integration, we can break it down into two parts: the polynomial term (1+cos(x))^2 and the linear term x.
