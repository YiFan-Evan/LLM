Then we add x to the integral, which was multiplied by the indefinite integral of sin(sincosx\u207b\u00b9). So, our final indefinite integral is:\n\n\u222b(sin(sincosx\u207b\u00b9) + x) = (cossin\u207b\u00b9(x) + x)|x=4\n\nNow we can calculate the value of cossin\u207b\u00b9(x) at x=4:\n\ncossin\u207b\u00b9(4) = cos\u207b\u00b9(sin(4)) = arcsin(sin(4))\n\nThe arcsin function returns the angle in radians between -\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, so we need to convert our input to radians. We know that sin(4) is approximately 0.7071067811865476, so our angle is approximately 45 degrees. Therefore, cossin\u207b\u00b9(4) is approximately 45 degrees.\n\nNow that we have cossin\u207b\u00b9(x), we can use it to find the indefinite integral again, adding C back in.
