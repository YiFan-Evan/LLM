To calculate the indefinite integral of this function, we need to use the integration rules for trig functions. Integration of a squared function can be expressed as the product of the indefinite integral and the original function itself raised to the power of minus 2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of cos(x)^2 is:\n\n\u222b cos(x)^2 dx = -sin(x) * cos(x) dx\n\nNow, to substitute 'x=4', we need to multiply the indefinite integral by 4. The result becomes:\n\n\u222b (cos(4))^2 * 4 dx = -sin(4) * cos(4) * 4 dx\n\nFinally, to simplify the expression further, we can use the addition formula for sin and cos functions to find their sum:\n\n\u222b (cos(4))^2 * 4 dx = -sin(4) * (cos(4) + 1) * 4 dx = -sin(4) * 5 * 4 dx\n\nNow, to calculate the indefinite integral, we need to integrate this expression from 0 to 4.
