To calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x), we need to use the fundamental principles of integration. Integration is the process of finding the area under a curve, and for functions like sinh(x), we need to use integration by parts or other integration techniques.\n\nIn this case, we can use integration by parts to find the indefinite integral of sinh(x).

So, for our specific problem, we can approximate y by sinh(x).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\u222bsinh(x) dx = (sinh(x) - sinh(x)/ln(e^x)) |(0, 4) = (sinh(4) - sinh(4)/ln(e^4)) - (sinh(0) - sinh(0)/ln(e^0)) = 2.37\n\nNow that we have calculated the indefinite integral, we need to substitute 'x=4' into the result. Substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral gives us:\n\u222bsinh(4) dx = (sinh(4) - sinh(4)/ln(e^4)) = 2.37\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2.37.\n\nNote: The value of ln(e^4) is approximately 2.16 and sinh(0) is approximately 0.
