Integration is the process of finding the area under a curve. To do this, we use the definition of the indefinite integral, which is the sum of the antiderivative and the constant C.\n\nTherefore, to find the indefinite integral of (1+x), we need to take the derivative of 1+x, which is x, and add it to 1. This gives us (x+1). Now, we can integrate this to find the indefinite integral. Integrating (x+1) gives us ln(x+1) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nTo find the result for x=4, we need to substitute 4 for x in our indefinite integral. Therefore, ln(4+1) + C = ln5 + C. To find the constant C, we can integrate again to get -C = ln(5/C), which can be solved for C = 5e^(-ln5) = 5/e.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5/e rounded down to an integer result of 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of (1+x)+x is ln(x+1) + C.
