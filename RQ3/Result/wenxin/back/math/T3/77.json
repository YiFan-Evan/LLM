Substituting a value into a mathematical expression does not change its mathematical meaning or result. In this case, 'x=4' represents a specific value for which the indefinite integral is being evaluated. When you substitute 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, you are replacing the variable 'x' with the specific value '4'. The indefinite integral remains the same, but it now represents a specific area under the curve for that specific value of 'x'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+x)/ln(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1+x)/ln(x)+x, we need to use the fundamental principles of integration.
