Therefore, we can write the indefinite integral as:\n\n\u222b(sin(x)^2 * ln(x) dx) = \u222b(sin(x)^2 * d(ln(x)) + \u222b(ln(x) dx)\n\nThe indefinite integral of ln(x) is just x * ln(x) + C, where C is a constant. Therefore, the indefinite integral of sin(x)^2 * ln(x) becomes:\n\n\u222b(sin(x)^2 * ln(x) dx) = (sin(x)^2 * x * ln(x) + C1) - \u222b(sin(x) dx)\n\nNow, we need to find the indefinite integral of sin(x). The derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), so we can write:\n\n\u222bsin(x) dx = -cos(x) + C2\n\nCombining all these pieces, we get:\n\n\u222bsin(x)^2 * ln(x) dx = (sin(x)^2 * x * ln(x) + C1 - (cos(x) + C2))\n\nSubstituting 'x=4' into this expression, we get:\n\n\u222bsin(4)^2 * ln(4) dx = (sin(4)^2 * 4 * ln(4) - cos(4) + C1)\n\nNow, to find the constant C1 and round down to an integer, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral again with a known value for x. For example, we can use x=5:\n\n\u222bsin(5)^2 * ln(5) dx = (sin(5)^2 * 5 * ln(5) - cos(5)) + C1\n\nNow, we can compare the two expressions and find the constant C1 by subtracting the second expression from the first. The result will be a constant C1 that depends on x=4. To round down to an integer, we can simply take the integer part of this expression.

To do this, we can substitute 'x=4' into the indefinite integral and simplify.
