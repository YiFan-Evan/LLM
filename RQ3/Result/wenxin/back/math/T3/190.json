Therefore, the indefinite integral of sinh(1/x) is just the derivative of sinh(1/x), which is cosh(1/x). For the indefinite integral of 1/(1/x), we can use the fundamental property of the natural logarithm, which has an indefinite integral that is equal to the function itself.

First, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral of sinh(1/x) * (1/(1/x)). This can be done by substituting 1/x with u, and using the fundamental property of the hyperbolic sine function, which has an indefinite integral that is equal to its derivative. This results in the indefinite integral of sinh(u) * (1/u). Next, we need to evaluate the indefinite integral of x. This can be done by using the fundamental property of the natural logarithm, which has an indefinite integral that is equal to the function itself. Therefore, the indefinite integral of the function expression is cosh(u) + u + x.\n\nNow that we have the indefinite integral, we can substitute 'x=4' into it.
