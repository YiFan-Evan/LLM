Integration is the process of taking the derivative of a function and subtracting a constant, which results in a new function that represents the area under the curve of the original function from a certain point to infinity.\n\nFor this problem, we need to find the area under the curve of the function e^x*ln(x) from 0 to infinity. To do this, we need to separate the integral into two parts: e^x and ln(x).\n\nFirst, we need to integrate e^x using the fundamental principles of integration: ln(u) = u - 1, where u is e^x. This gives us e^x*ln(x) = e^x*(x - 1) + C, where C is a constant.\n\nSecond, we need to integrate ln(x) using the natural logarithm function, ln(x) = (x-1)/2 + D, where D is a constant. This gives us ln(x)*e^x = (x-1)^2/2 + D*e^x + E, where E is another constant.\n\nCombining these two results, we get e^(x)*(x - 1) + C - ((x-1)^2/2 + D*e^x + E), where C and D are constants. To simplify this expression further, we can eliminate C and E by substituting x = 4 into the expression and evaluating it at x = 4.\n\nTherefore, substituting x = 4 into the expression results in (4 - 1)^2/2 + (4 - 1)/2 * e^4. Evaluating this expression at x = 4, we get 5.5 + 4 * e^4. After rounding down, we get the final answer: 5.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x*ln(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x*ln(x)+x, we need to use the fundamental principles of integration.
