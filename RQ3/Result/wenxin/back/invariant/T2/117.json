The loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop is:\n\n`member_value_i = arr[id_i]`\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `member_value` is initially set to `-1` indicating that there is no member value associated with the index `id`.\n* The `while` loop iterates over the array until it reaches the end (`r < len(arr)`).\n* Inside the loop, if the current index (`r`) is equal to the desired `id`, the value at that index (`arr[r]`) is assigned to `member_value`.\n* The loop then advances by incrementing `r` by 1.\n* Once the loop exits, the final value of `member_value` will be the value at the desired index.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the `give_member` function's loop is `member_value_i = arr[id_i]`. This invariant ensures that the correct member value is retrieved from the array based on the provided index `id`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        if r == id:\n            member_value = arr[r]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u9884\u671f\u7684\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5373\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u6307\u5b9a\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u503c\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u5316 `r`\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u52a0\u4e0a `r = 0` \u5c31\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e86\u3002\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    r = 0\n    while r < len(arr):\n        r += 1\n        if r == id:\n            member_value = arr[r]\n        else:\n            member_value = arr[r] + 1  # \u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u4e86id\uff0c\u5219\u8fd4\u56de\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u7d22\u5f15 `id`\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u8be5\u7d22\u5f15\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u503c\u8d4b\u503c\u7ed9 `member_value`\u3002\u5982\u679c `id` \u4e0d\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5b83\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u503c\uff08\u4ece\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff09\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5047\u8bbe\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u662f\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u4e0d\u662f\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539\u3002"}]
