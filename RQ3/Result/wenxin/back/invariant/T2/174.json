Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly inserts a new element into the correct position in a sorted list.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to provide a loop invariant for each iteration of the loop. A loop invariant is a statement that remains true at each iteration of a loop, and it helps us prove the correctness of the loop.\n\nFor the i-th iteration of the loop, the invariant would be:\n\n* `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[o]`: This invariant ensures that we are inserting the element `arr[i]` correctly into the sorted list.\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1. At the start of the i-th iteration, `arr[i]` is the next element to be inserted.\n2. We compare `arr[i]` with `arr[z]` for each element `arr[z]` with `arr[i]`. If `arr[z]` is greater than `arr[i]`, we swap them and decrease `z` by 1. This ensures that `arr[i]` is always inserted correctly into the sorted list.\n3. After completing the inner while loop, we increment `o`, which represents the current position of the end of the sorted list.\n4. The invariant holds for the next iteration because `arr[i]` has been correctly inserted into the sorted list at `o` positions earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the provided code fulfills the loop invariant for each iteration and proves its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = -1\n    while o < len(arr) - 1:\n        o += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u4f3c\u4e4e\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u8fd9\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528`i`\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`z`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7d22\u5f15\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\n\n\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        current = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > current:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = current\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u9996\u5148\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5176\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u90fd\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u5176\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u76f8\u5e94\u5730\u79fb\u52a8\u5b83\u4eec\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`j`\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u592a\u76f4\u89c2\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u4e60\u60ef\u6765\u547d\u540d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u91cf\u3002"}]
