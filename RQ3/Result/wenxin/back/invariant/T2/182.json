The program uses a nested loop to compare each element in the array with the element immediately following it, and swaps them if necessary to achieve sorting.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program for the i-th iteration of the loop, we need to establish an invariant that ensures the program maintains the correct order of the array elements.\n\nHere's an invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\n\n`arr_sorted[i] = selection_sort(arr_sorted[i+1:])`\n\nThis invariant assumes that the sorted array (arr_sorted) is initially empty, and the program iteratively builds it by performing selection sort on the unsorted array (arr). It also assumes that arr_sorted[i+1:] is a subset of arr that has been partially sorted.\n\nHere's how this invariant proves the partial correctness of the program:\n\n1. Initially, the sorted array is empty, so arr_sorted[i] is undefined for all i.\n2. In the first iteration of the outer loop, we perform selection sort on arr[c+1:], which is a subarray of arr starting at index c+1 and continuing to the end of the array. This is equivalent to arr_sorted[i+1:] in our invariant.\n3. Since we've just sorted a subarray, it follows that arr_sorted[i] is now in sorted order, and we can initialize it with the result of selection sort on arr_sorted[i+1:].\n4. The rest of the outer loop then proceeds by moving c forward by one position, performing selection sort on the remaining unsorted elements, and updating arr_sorted[i] with the result.\n5. Since we've established an invariant that arr_sorted[i] is always in sorted order, it follows that the entire array arr has been sorted by the end of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided Python program correctly sorts an array using selection sort by establishing an invariant that ensures the correct order of the array elements during each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    c = -1\n    while c < len(arr) - 1:\n        c += 1\n        z = c + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[c]:\n                temp = arr[c]\n                arr[c] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662fPython\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5f00\u5934\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e9b\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\uff1a\n\n* `c = -1`\u662f\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u662f\u5b9e\u9645\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u53ef\u80fd\u4f60\u7684\u610f\u601d\u662f\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e3a0\u3002\n* \u5728while\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u662f`len(arr) - 1`\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4f60\u53ea\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u524dlen(arr) - 1\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528`len(arr)`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\n\n\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u4e3a\u4f60\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c < len(arr):\n        c += 1\n        z = c + 1\n        while z < len(arr) - 1:  # \u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\n            if arr[z] < arr[c]:\n                temp = arr[c]\n                arr[c] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        c += 1  # \u5bf9\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f6e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u5e38\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u8bb8\u591a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5217\u8868\u5207\u7247\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u5730\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c06\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}]
