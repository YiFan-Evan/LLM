The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop invariant I would suggest for the i-th iteration of the loop is: `sorted_q_plus_one = 0`. Here's an explanation of what it means:\n\nIn each iteration of the outer while loop, we will process the elements `arr[q]` through `arr[q-1]` until we find the first element `arr[i]` that is greater than or equal to its left neighbor `arr[i-1]`. We call this value `z`.\n\nAfter we find `z`, we will swap `arr[i]` with `arr[z-1]` and increment `q` by 1. This ensures that the elements in the range `arr[q]` through `arr[q-1]` are sorted.\n\nAfter finishing this iteration, we also need to adjust `sorted_q_plus_one`, which will become equal to the index of the last sorted element, as a result of swapping elements and incrementing `q`. This will make sure that `sorted_q_plus_one` contains the number of sorted elements at the end of each iteration.\n\nThis invariant helps us keep track of how many elements we have already sorted and is used to prove partial correctness of the algorithm.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    sorted_q_plus_one = 0\n    while q < len(arr):\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        sorted_q_plus_one += 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = -1\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:\n        q += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u8bd5\u56fe\u4f7f\u7528`arr[i - 1]`\u548c`arr[z]`\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u90fd\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u79fb\u52a8\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u5176\u524d\u9762\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u4f1a\u5411\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7684\u5730\u65b9\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
