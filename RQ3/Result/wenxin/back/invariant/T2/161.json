Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly inserts a new element into the correct position in a sorted subarray.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be written as:\n\n\"b_value = arr[b] <= arr[i-1] <= arr[i]\": This invariant ensures that the elements in the sorted subarray are in ascending order. It holds at the start of each iteration and is used to determine the next element to be inserted into the sorted subarray.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The outer while loop iterates over the array from index b to the end.\n* The inner while loop moves the element at index z to the correct position in the sorted subarray. It starts from index z-1 because we need to keep track of the previous element that has been sorted.\n* If the element at index z is greater than or equal to the element at index z-1, then it can be inserted at the correct position. Otherwise, it needs to be moved to the correct position by swapping with the element at index z-1.\n* After each swap, the sorted subarray is updated by moving the element at index z-1 one position down.\n* The invariant ensures that the elements in the sorted subarray are in ascending order after each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm ensures that the elements in the sorted subarray are in ascending order. This invariant is used to determine the next element to be inserted into the sorted subarray and is maintained throughout each iteration of the outer loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = -1\n    while b < len(arr) - 1:\n        b += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u9010\u884c\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u4fee\u590d\u5b83\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = -1\n    while b < len(arr) - 1:\n        # \u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u5426\u5219\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\n        i = b + 1\n        while i > 0 and arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:\n            temp = arr[i]\n            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]\n            arr[i - 1] = temp\n            i -= 1\n        b += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6309\u7167\u9884\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u89e3\u91ca\u4e00\u4e0b\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\uff1a\n\n* `b` \u662f\u7528\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f53\u524d\u6b63\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b50\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n* `i` \u662f\u6211\u4eec\u5f00\u59cb\u641c\u7d22\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u5b83\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u4e4b\u540e\u7684\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f00\u59cb\u641c\u7d22\u3002\n* \u5f53 `i` \u5728\u5b50\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u5411\u4e0b\u79fb\u52a8\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u6839\u636e\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ed3\u679c\u79fb\u52a8\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u5982\u679c\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5927\uff0c\u5219\u4ea4\u6362\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u3002\n* \u5f53\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd4\u56de\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u5143\u7d20\u3002"}]
