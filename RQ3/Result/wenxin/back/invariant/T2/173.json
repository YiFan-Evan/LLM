Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly inserts a new element into the correct location within an already sorted list.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n* `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[n]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order from `i` to `n` positions.\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The outer while loop iterates from `i = 0` to `n-1`. It ensures that we are dealing with sorted subarrays, starting from the initial position `i`.\n2. The inner while loop is inside the outer loop, and it compares `arr[z]` with `arr[z - 1]`. It swaps the two if they are in the wrong order, and then `z` is decremented by 1, making the comparison for the next iteration.\n3. The invariant ensures that `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[n]` holds true for each iteration of the outer loop. This invariant proves that the array is sorted after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant proves that the insertion sort algorithm maintains the sorted order of the array during each iteration of the loop, making it a partial correctness proof for the provided code."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`z`\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u5185\u90e8\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u4eec\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u53c2\u6570\u6216\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u503c\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u5185\u90e8\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a`i`\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u51fd\u6570\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u770b\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\n\n\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u80fd\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr) - 1\n    while n >= 0:\n        for i in range(n + 1):\n            j = i + 1\n            while j > 0 and arr[j - 1] > arr[j]:\n                arr[j] = arr[j - 1]\n                j -= 1\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[i]\n        n -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u4ece\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b50\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b83\u9010\u6b65\u5411\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u5b8c\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662fO(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002"}]
