Loop invariant is a statement that holds true at each iteration of the loop and helps us prove the correctness of the loop.\n\nHere's an invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n**Invariant**: `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[r]`\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Initialization**: This invariant holds true for the first iteration, because we are inserting `arr[i]` into the sorted part of the array.\n2. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop checks if `arr[z]` needs to be swapped with `arr[z-1]` if `arr[z-1]` is greater than `arr[z]`. If this swap happens, then `arr[z-1]` will become the next element in the sorted part, making sure that `arr[i] <= arr[z-1]`. Also, this swapping moves `arr[i]` closer to the sorted part, making sure that `arr[i] <= arr[z]`. Hence, after swapping, we have `arr[i] <= arr[z-1] <= arr[z]`, which proves the loop invariant for the next iteration.\n3. **Exit Condition**: The exit condition of the inner loop is when `z` becomes 0 or when `arr[z] <= arr[z-1]`. This ensures that the sorted part does not grow beyond `r`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided Python program with loop invariant `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[r]` correctly implements insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`z`\u662f\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u6574\u6570\u548c\u5217\u8868\u7d22\u5f15\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u60f3\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u5982`current_element`\u548c`previous_element`\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u66f4\u6b63\u4e00\u4e9b\u8bed\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        previous_element = arr[r - 1]\n        current_element = arr[r]\n        while previous_element > current_element:\n            temp = arr[r]\n            arr[r] = arr[r - 1]\n            arr[r - 1] = temp\n            previous_element = arr[r - 1]\n            current_element = arr[r]\n        arr[r - 1] += 1  # \u6ce8\u610f\u8fd9\u91cc\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u7d22\u5f15r-1\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u9012\u589e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u8be5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4f1a\u88ab\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u8986\u76d6\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u6309\u7167\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u5217\u8868\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
