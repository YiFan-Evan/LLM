It proves the correctness of the loop operation.\n2. **Invariants for the `i-th` iteration**: For each iteration, you need to prove that the value of `last_value` will be updated with the correct value of the current array element `arr[h]`. This proves that you are not mistakenly overwriting it with the initial value of `arr[0]`.\n\nBased on these requirements, here's the loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration:\n\n`last_value_value = give_last(arr[i]->arr[i])`\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is**:\n\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration ensures that the last value calculated is the value of `arr[i]` after applying `give_last` function to it.\n\nNote: It is unclear what `give_last` function exactly does in this context. It should return a value, and based on its implementation in your code, it seems to be simply copying the value of `arr[i]` to `last_value`.
