Insertion sort is a non-comparison sorting algorithm that works by placing elements into their correct positions once they are in sorted order. The process is repeated until the array is sorted.\n\nNow, to prove the partial correctness of your code, you need to provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop. Loop invariant is a statement that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\nHere's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n* `arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] <= ... <= arr[n - 1]` where n is the length of the array\n\nNow, let's break it down:\n\n1. Initially, the loop invariant states that `arr[i]` is smaller than or equal to its neighbors. This is true because we are dealing with a sorted array.\n2. Inside the while loop, we perform an insertion operation. We compare `arr[i]` with `arr[z]` and `arr[z - 1]` and swap them if necessary. This ensures that `arr[i]` becomes smaller than `arr[z]` and `arr[z - 1]`.\n3. After each iteration, the loop invariant gets updated to reflect the fact that `arr[i]` has been moved to its correct position in the sorted array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe provided code is correct as long as the loop invariant holds true throughout the execution of the while loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = -1\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\n        s += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u6b63\u5728\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u7f16\u7a0b\uff0c\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf `i` \u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4e24\u6b21\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u6765\u4ee3\u8868\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6211\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = -1\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\n        s += 1\n        z = arr[s]\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z = arr[z - 1]\n        arr.insert(s, z)  # \u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u5e38\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u6309\u7167\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u89c4\u5219\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6211\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a `arr.insert(s, z)` \u7684\u8bed\u53e5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c06\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u63d2\u5165\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684 `s` \u662f\u7528\u4e8e\u6307\u5411\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e94\u8be5\u6839\u636e\u63d2\u5165\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}]
