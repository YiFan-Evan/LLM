The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`sum_value_i = give_sum(arr[i] -> arr[m])`\n\nIn each iteration, we add the current element of the array to the running sum. Then, we move the m pointer to the next element in the array. This ensures that we only include elements from the array in the sum, and avoids unnecessary calculations.\n\nNow, let's explain the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. **Loop invariant** - A loop invariant is a statement that holds true at each iteration of a loop, and helps us prove the correctness of the loop.\n2. **Incorporation of previous iteration's sum** - We keep track of the sum using a variable `sum_value` and add each element of the array to it. This ensures that we only include elements from the array in the sum, and avoids unnecessary calculations.\n3. **Pointer increment** - We increment the `m` pointer by 1 after adding each element to the sum, so that we skip over any elements that have already been included in the sum.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sum_value_i = give_sum(arr[i] -> arr[m])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    m = -1\n    while m < len(arr) - 1:\n        m += 1\n        sum_value += arr[m]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u4e2aPython\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u4e4b\u548c\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u540d `give_sum` \u5e76\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u7ed9\u51fa\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u603b\u548c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8fd4\u56de\u4e86\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7d2f\u52a0\u548c\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0 `sum_value` \u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06 `m` \u6307\u9488\u5411\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4f4d\u3002\u5f53 `m` \u6307\u9488\u5230\u8fbe\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u8df3\u8fc7\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u7ee7\u7eed\u524d\u8fdb\u5230\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4 `arr`\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a\n\n`sum_value_i = give_sum(arr[i] -> arr[m])`\n\n\u5176\u4e2d `sum_value_i` \u662f\u5f53\u524d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u7d2f\u52a0\u548c\uff0c`arr[i] -> arr[m]` \u662f\u5f53\u524d\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u90e8\u5206\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002"}]
