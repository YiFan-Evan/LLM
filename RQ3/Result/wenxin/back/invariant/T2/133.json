The program defines a function `give_mid` that takes an array `arr` as input and returns the median value.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to provide a loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop. Let's do so by stating the invariant in the format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`.\n\nFor the `i-th` iteration, the invariant would be:\n\n* `mid_value = fun(arr[mid_value]->arr[mid_value])`: This means that `mid_value` is always the median value of the current subarray.\n\nNow, let's explain the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. **Selection Sort**: The algorithm used here is a variant of selection sort. It selects the middle element as the median, but instead of iterating through the entire array, it only iterates through half of it, keeping track of the median in each iteration.\n2. **O(n) Time Complexity**: The algorithm only iterates through half of the array, which has a time complexity of O(n).\n3. **Stable Sort**: The algorithm is stable, meaning that elements with equal values are not reordered.\n\nNow, let's provide the answer to the problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \":\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The program correctly finds the median of an array using a selection sort algorithm with a time complexity of O(n).
