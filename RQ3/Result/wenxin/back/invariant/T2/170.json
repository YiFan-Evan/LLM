Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly inserts each element of the array into its correct location. The process involves a loop, where the code will keep track of the index `i` of the element being processed and moving it through the array while maintaining an invariant condition to keep track of where each element should be placed in the sorted array.\n\nIn this specific code, the loop invariant condition is as follows:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ...`\n\nThis condition ensures that each element `arr[i]` is moved to its correct position in the sorted array, based on the comparison with the elements around it. It's a way of saying that the elements `arr[i]` and all the elements to its right are smaller than or equal to it.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to show that this invariant condition holds true for each iteration of the loop.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Initially, `i` is set to 0, so `arr[i]` is the first element of the array.\n* Inside the inner while loop, we move `arr[i]` to its correct position based on the comparison with `arr[z]` and `arr[z-1]`. If `arr[z]` or `arr[z-1]` is greater than `arr[i]`, then `arr[i]` is moved to the left, until it finds a position where it fits in.\n* After moving `arr[i]`, we increment `i` by 1, so that we process the next element of the array.\n* The invariant condition holds true for each iteration of the loop, because it ensures that each element is moved to its correct position in the sorted array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided code implements insertion sort algorithm for a given array and maintains a loop invariant condition to keep track of where each element should be placed in the sorted array. This invariant condition ensures that each element is moved to its correct position in the sorted array based on the comparison with the elements around it."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = -1\n    while k < len(arr) - 1:\n        k += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6211\u660e\u767d\u4e86\uff0c\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u5199\u597d\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b83\u3002\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf`z`\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = -1\n    while k < len(arr) - 1:\n        k += 1\n        z = k\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        arr.append(None)  # \u4e3a\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u7ec4\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u597d\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u901a\u8fc7\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u76f8\u90bb\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5c06\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u53f3\u4fa7\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u989d\u5916\u7684None\u5143\u7d20\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u957f\u5ea6\u76f8\u540c\u3002"}]
