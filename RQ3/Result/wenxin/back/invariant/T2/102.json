Let's verify the loop invariant to ensure the correctness of the program.\n\nLoop invariant for i-th iteration:\n\n\"member_at_index_i_value = fun(arr[member_at_index_i]->arr[member_at_index_i])\"\n\nThis invariant states that the value of the member at the current index (i) is equal to the result of applying the function fun to the value at that index and the index itself.\n\nNow, let's explain the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. We need to maintain a valid member value during each iteration of the loop. This value is initialized as -1.\n2. For each iteration, we compare the current index (c) with the id specified as a parameter to the function. If they match, we update the member_value with the value at that index.\n3. After each iteration, we increment c by 1 to move to the next index.\n4. The loop terminates when c reaches the length of the array, indicating that no more members with the specified id exist.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"The loop invariant correctly proves that this Python program will correctly find the value of a member with a specific id from an array.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    c = -1\n    while c < len(arr) - 1:\n        c += 1\n        if c == id:\n            member_value = arr[c]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728 `while` \u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5199\u7684\u662f `c < len(arr) - 1`\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u5c31\u8fd4\u56de\u4e86 `member_value`\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u8bf4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u6267\u884c\u5b8c\u6bd5\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u5faa\u73af\u786e\u5b9e\u6267\u884c\u5b8c\u6bd5\u540e\u518d\u8fd4\u56de `member_value`\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    c = -1\n    while c < len(arr):\n        c += 1\n        if c == id:\n            member_value = arr[c]\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4 `arr` \u4e2d\u67e5\u627e\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a `id` \u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\u3002\u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u8be5\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u8be5\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\uff1b\u5426\u5219\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de -1\u3002"}]
