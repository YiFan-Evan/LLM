The program uses a nested loop to compare each element with the first element, and swaps them if necessary.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program for the i-th iteration of the loop, we need to provide a loop invariant that indicates the state of the array at each iteration. Here's such an invariant:\n\nInvariant: 'sorted_elements = False'\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Initially, the program does not perform any sorting operations, so 'sorted_elements' is set to False.\n* At each iteration, the outer loop checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the next element in the array. If it is, it swaps them. This ensures that the array is sorted in ascending order.\n* Therefore, if 'sorted_elements' is still False after the inner loop, it means that at least one element was swapped during the current iteration, indicating that the array is still not sorted.\n* If 'sorted_elements' becomes True after an iteration, it means that all elements were swapped in that iteration, indicating that the array is now sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nInvariant: 'sorted_elements = True' for the i-th iteration of the loop, indicating that the array is now sorted after the i-th iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        z = h + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[h]:\n                temp = arr[h]\n                arr[h] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684 `h` \u7684\u521d\u59cb\u503c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f `0` \u800c\u4e0d\u662f `-1`\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f60\u7684\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u662f\u9010\u4e2a\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u4f60\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6 `h < len(arr) - 1` \u8868\u793a\u7684\u662f\u6211\u4eec\u5c1a\u672a\u5904\u7406\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u5316 `h` \u4e3a `-1` \u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002\n\n\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5bf9 `z` \u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u8fdb\u884c\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u7ec4\u8d8a\u754c\u3002\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u90fd\u68c0\u67e5 `z` \u662f\u5426\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = h + 1\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z] >= arr[h]:\n            # Swap arr[h] and arr[z] if arr[z] is smaller than arr[h]\n            temp = arr[h]\n            arr[h] = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
