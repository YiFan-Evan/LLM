The program uses a nested loop to compare each element with the first element, and swaps them if necessary.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop. The invariant should state the condition of the array at each iteration.\n\nHere's an invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n\n```python\narr_sorted_value = False\n```\nIn each iteration, the inner loop compares each element with the first element. If the element is smaller than the first element, it is swapped with the first element. This ensures that the first element is always the smallest element in its current position.\n\nAfter swapping, the outer loop moves to the next position and repeats the process. This continues until all elements have been processed and sorted in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe provided Python program correctly performs selection sort on an array by maintaining the invariant that the first element is always the smallest element in its current position."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    o = -1\n    while o < len(arr) - 1:\n        o += 1\n        z = o + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[o]:\n                temp = arr[o]\n                arr[o] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u589e\u52a0`o`\u7684\u503c\u65f6\uff0c\u6ca1\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528`z`\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`o`\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6ca1\u6709\u8fd4\u56de\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        min_index = i\n        j = i + 1\n        while j < len(arr):\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n            j += 1\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u7248\u672c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u67e5\u627e\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u4e00\u65e6\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5b83\u5c31\u88ab\u4ea4\u6362\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
