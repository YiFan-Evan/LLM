The loop invariant you're asked to provide is an assertion that proves the partial correctness of the program during each iteration of the loop.\n\nLet's examine the code in detail:\n\n* `h = 0`: A loop counter variable that tracks how many elements have been processed.\n* `while h < len(arr)`: The outer loop iterates until `h` reaches the length of the array.\n* `z = i`: An inner loop variable that iterates over the sorted list (the first `h` elements).\n* `while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`: The inner loop checks if the element at position `z` needs to be moved. If the element at position `z - 1` is greater than the element at position `z`, then it means that `z` needs to be moved to the right position.\n* `temp = arr[z]`: Temporarily stores the value of the element to be moved.\n* `arr[z] = arr[z - 1]`: The element at position `z - 1` is swapped with the element at position `z`, thus moving `z` to its correct position.\n* `arr[z - 1] = temp`: The original value of `z` is restored after swapping.\n* `z -= 1`: The inner loop continues until it reaches the first unsorted element.\n* `h += 1`: Increments `h` by one after each iteration of the inner loop.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop should be written in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`. Here, `xxx_value` refers to a specific variable within the loop, and `fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])` refers to a function that calculates a value based on the current state of the array at positions `xxx` and `xxx+1`.\n\nFor each iteration, we can use the invariant `arr[i-1] <= arr[i]` to prove the partial correctness of the program. This invariant ensures that when an element is moved to its correct position, it is indeed less than or equal to the element at its right position. This invariant is true before and after each swapping operation, and it proves that the program moves elements correctly in the sorted order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Each iteration of the loop maintains the invariant `arr[i-1] <= arr[i]`, which proves the partial correctness of the insertion sort algorithm implementation provided."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = -1\n    while h < len(arr) - 1:\n        h += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5728 `while` \u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86 `i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49 `i`\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u5e94\u8be5\u662f `while h < len(arr)`\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f60\u60f3\u6bd4\u8f83\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u540e\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u540e\u9762\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662f `z`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49 `i`\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr):\n        z = h\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\uff1a\u4ece\u5de6\u5230\u53f3\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u628a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u5176\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5176\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c31\u4ea4\u6362\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6211\u4eec\u904d\u5386\u5b8c\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
