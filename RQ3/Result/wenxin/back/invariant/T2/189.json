The goal of the algorithm is to find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array, move it to its correct position, and then continue this process with the remaining unsorted elements.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer while loop in your code is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[j]`\n\nThis invariant is used to prove the partial correctness of the program because it ensures that at each iteration of the inner while loop, we are moving an element that is less than or equal to `arr[j]`, which is our current minimum candidate. If this invariant is not true, then the inner while loop may skip some elements that should be compared with `arr[j]`.\n\nHere's an explanation of how this invariant is used:\n\n* In the first iteration of the outer while loop, `j` is set to 0, so `arr[i] <= arr[j]` becomes `arr[i] <= 0`.\n* Inside the inner while loop, if `arr[z]` is found to be less than `arr[j]`, then `arr[j]` is moved to its correct position and `arr[z]` is moved to the position of `arr[j]`. This ensures that `arr[j]` is always the minimum element in its current subarray.\n* After this, `j` is incremented by 1, and we move on to the next element `i+1`. This means that at each iteration, we move closer to the end of the unsorted part of the array, and the minimum element in each subarray gets more and more likely to be in its correct position.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer while loop in the selection sort algorithm is `arr[i] <= arr[j]`. This invariant ensures that at each iteration of the inner while loop, we are moving an element that is less than or equal to `arr[j]`, which is our current minimum candidate."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    j = -1\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        j += 1\n        z = j + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[j]:\n                temp = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u4e1c\u897f\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5b83\u786e\u5b9e\u4f1a\u79fb\u52a8\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u60f3\u4f7f\u7528\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u6765\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u7a0d\u5fae\u4fee\u6539\u4e00\u4e0b\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u7ee7\u7eed\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u5b8c\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(arr) - 1:\n        min_index = j\n        z = j + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = z\n            z += 1\n        temp = arr[j]\n        arr[j] = arr[min_index]\n        arr[min_index] = temp\n        j += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u7d22\u5f15 `j` \u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5b83\u904d\u5386\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u627e\u5230\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a `j` \u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c06\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u5b83\u8fd4\u56de\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u662f\u6709\u5e8f\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b83\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u5927\u4e8e\u7b49\u4e8e2\uff08\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5728\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u65f6\u5019\uff09\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u6709\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f1a\u8fdb\u884c\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u5904\u7406\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u975e\u5e38\u5927\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002"}]
