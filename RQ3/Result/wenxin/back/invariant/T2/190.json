The program uses a loop to iterate through the array and compare each element with the current \"pivot\" element (k). If an element is found to be less than the pivot, it is swapped with the pivot. The pivot then moves to the next position, so that the next comparison is between the previous pivot and the rest of the array. This process continues until the end of the array is reached, ensuring that the array is sorted in ascending order.\n\nNow, for each iteration of the loop, we can provide a loop invariant that proves the partial correctness of the program. A loop invariant is a statement that remains true throughout the loop's execution.\n\nFor the i-th iteration of the loop, the invariant would be:\n\n`arr[i] <= fun(arr[i] -> arr[i+1])`\n\nThis invariant states that the value of `arr[i]` is no greater than the value of its successor (`arr[i+1]`). This follows from the selection sort algorithm, where each element is only compared with elements that come after it in the array.\n\nHere's an explanation of how this invariant follows from the selection sort algorithm:\n\n* At the start of each iteration, `k` is set to 0, which means that `arr[k]` (the current pivot) is at position 0.\n* The inner while loop compares `arr[z]` (the next element) with `arr[k]`. If `arr[z]` is less than `arr[k]`, it means that `arr[z+1]` (the next element after `arr[z]`) should be placed before `arr[k+1]` (the next element after `arr[k]`) in the sorted array. Therefore, `arr[z+1] <= fun(arr[z+1] -> arr[z+2])` must hold for this iteration.\n* After swapping `arr[k]` and `arr[z]`, `arr[k]` becomes the new pivot for the next iteration. Therefore, `arr[k+1] <= fun(arr[k+1] -> arr[k+2])` must hold for this iteration as well.\n* Since `k` is incremented after each iteration, it follows that `arr[i] <= fun(arr[i] -> arr[i+1])` must hold for this iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Therefore, the provided Python program fulfills its purpose of implementing selection sort and maintains the loop invariant `arr[i] <= fun(arr[i] -> arr[i+1])` for each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    k = -1\n    while k < len(arr) - 1:\n        k += 1\n        z = k + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[k]:\n                temp = arr[k]\n                arr[k] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u4ece\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5b58\u653e\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5168\u90e8\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5143\u7d20\u6392\u5b8c\u3002\n\n\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u5269\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08k\uff09\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u88ab\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6211\u6ce8\u610f\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5199\u7684\u662f `z += 1`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06 `k` \u589e\u52a01\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f `z`\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u505a\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    k = 0\n    while k < len(arr) - 1:\n        min_index = k\n        z = k + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = z\n            z += 1\n        temp = arr[k]\n        arr[k] = arr[min_index]\n        arr[min_index] = temp\n        k += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u73b0\u5728\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
