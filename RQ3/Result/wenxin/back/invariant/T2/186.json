The program uses a nested loop to compare each element in the array with the first element, and then with the second element, and so on. If an element is found to be smaller than the first element, it is swapped with the first element. This process is repeated for each element in the array until it is sorted.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program for the i-th iteration of the loop, we need to provide a loop invariant that ensures that the program maintains the correct order of elements in the array during each iteration.\n\nLoop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n* `arr_sorted[i] = arr[i]` - This invariant ensures that the i-th element in the sorted array is also the i-th element in the original array. This invariant is maintained by the program because it ensures that no elements are missed or double-swapped during the sorting process.\n\nExplanation of fundamental principles involved:\n\n* Selection sort works by repeatedly picking the minimum element from unsorted part of the array and moving it to its correct position.\n* The nested loops ensure that each element is compared with all other elements before deciding its new position.\n* The invariant `arr_sorted[i] = arr[i]` ensures that the sorted array correctly reflects the original order of elements in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided Python program for selection sort maintains the correct order of elements in the array during each iteration, as proven by the provided loop invariant."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    g = -1\n    while g < len(arr) - 1:\n        g += 1\n        z = g + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[g]:\n                temp = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u662f\u7684\uff0c\u60a8\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684Python\u7a0b\u5e8f\u786e\u5b9e\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ef4\u62a4\u4e86\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\uff0c\u60a8\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf `g` \u589e\u52a01\uff0c\u800c `z` \u5219\u662f\u4ece `g + 1` \u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bd4 `g` \u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5927\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5c31\u4ea4\u6362\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\uff0c\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4f1a\u5411\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4f4d\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5c06\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a `arr[g:len(arr)] = arr[len(arr)-1:]`\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u72b6\u6001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5c06\u8981\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u662f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u60a8\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u662f\uff1a\n\n`arr_sorted[i] = arr[i] for i in range(len(arr)-1)`\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u60a8\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
