Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly inserts a new element into the correct location within an already sorted subarray.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[d]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the sorted subarray up to index d are in ascending order. It holds at the start of each iteration and is used to prove the partial correctness of the program.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Initially, the invariant `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[d]` holds true, because `i` is set to zero and `d` is initialized to zero.\n* In the first while loop, the element `arr[z]` is compared with `arr[i]` and `arr[i+1]`, and if it is greater than both, it is moved to the correct position within the sorted subarray. This ensures that the sorted subarray remains in ascending order.\n* After moving `arr[z]`, `z` is decremented, and the invariant is checked again. If it still holds true, the outer while loop continues with the next iteration. Otherwise, it is assumed that `z` did not decrement properly, which can happen due to some issues with the implementation.\n* The loop invariant holds true at the end of each iteration, because the sorted subarray is extended by moving `arr[z]` into its correct position.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant ensures that each iteration of the loop moves the elements in the sorted subarray up to index d in ascending order, thereby gradually sorting the entire array using insertion sort algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = -1\n    while d < len(arr) - 1:\n        d += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3a`insertion_sort`\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570`arr`\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u63d0\u4f9b\u4efb\u4f55\u5173\u4e8e\u5982\u4f55\u521d\u59cb\u5316`i`\u7684\u503c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\n\n\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5b83\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`i`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f1a\u4f7f\u7528`i`\u6765\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u6df7\u6dc6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u6211\u4eec\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5730\u65b9\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5b57\u65f6\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        d = i\n        while d > 0 and arr[d - 1] > arr[d]:\n            temp = arr[d - 1]\n            arr[d - 1] = arr[d]\n            arr[d] = temp\n            d -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff08\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a1\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u627e\u5230\u5e94\u8be5\u63d2\u5165\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5927\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5c31\u4f1a\u88ab\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u88ab\u5b8c\u5168\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u6f84\u6e05\uff0c\u8bf7\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff01"}]
