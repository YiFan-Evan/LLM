To prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to establish a loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop.\n\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop should reflect the current state of the program, ensuring that the loop conditions are met and maintaining a useful intermediate value.\n\nHere's an example loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration:\n\n`member_value_at_index_i = give_member(arr, i)`\n\nThis invariant states that at each iteration, the value of `member_value` is equal to the value of the member at the current index `i` after applying the function `give_member(arr, i)` to it.\n\nNow, let's explain the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. **Loop invariant**: An invariant is a statement that holds true at each iteration of a loop or a condition that remains true throughout a computation. It helps us prove the correctness of a program by establishing a relationship between intermediate values and final results.\n2. **Loop conditions**: The loop condition ensures that we iterate through all indices of the array `arr` until we reach the desired index `id`.\n3. **Function call**: The function `give_member(arr, id)` is called inside the loop to retrieve the value of the member at index `id`.\n4. **Index increment**: The index `i` is incremented after each iteration to ensure that we don't miss any indices in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n`member_value_at_index_i = give_member(arr, i)`\n\nThis invariant ensures that we are correctly retrieving the value of the member at index `id` from the array `arr` and maintaining a useful intermediate value for each iteration."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        i += 1\n        if i == id:\n            member_value = arr[i]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728 `while` \u5faa\u73af\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u6b63\u5e38\u7ed3\u675f\u3002\u6211\u4e3a\u4f60\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1 and i < id:\n        i += 1\n        if i == id:\n            member_value = arr[i]\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4 `arr`\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a `id` \u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u5176\u503c\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u5c0f\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7d22\u5f15 `id`\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u7ee7\u7eed\u6267\u884c\u76f4\u5230\u8fbe\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}]
