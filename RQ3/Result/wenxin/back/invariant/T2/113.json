Let's start by describing the fundamental principles involved:\n\n* **Loop invariant**: The invariant states a condition that must hold true throughout each iteration of the loop.\n* **Current invariant** (for iteration `i`): We can assume that `member_value` has been initialized to `-1` and `n` has been incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.\n* **Next invariant** (for next iteration): We need to prove that if `n` is equal to `id`, then `member_value` will be set to the value of the member at index `id` in `arr`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the `give_member` function in each iteration is:\n\n`member_value_value = fun(arr[member_value]->arr[id])`\n\nThis invariant ensures that if `n` is equal to `id`, then `member_value` will be set to the value of the member at index `id` in `arr`.
