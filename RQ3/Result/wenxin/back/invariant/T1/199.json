The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The process continues until all elements are sorted.\n\nThe loop invariant I propose for the i-th iteration of the loop is: `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[t-1]`, where t is the end of the sorted part of the array. This invariant states that each element of the unsorted part of the array is greater than or equal to the previous one, so we can confidently swap elements and maintain sortedness.\n\nHere's how this invariant is checked in each iteration:\n\n* In the inner while loop, we find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array, `arr[z]`. Since we move this element to its correct position, `arr[t]`, it must be greater than `arr[z]` in order to maintain sortedness.\n* The outer while loop then moves one position further, increasing `t` by 1, ensuring that we continue moving towards the end of the sorted part of the array.\n\nTherefore, for each i from 0 to len(arr)-2 (except for the last iteration, which does not include arr[len(arr)-1], because it's always the last element), arr[i] <= arr[i+1], ensuring that we can confidently move elements within the unsorted part of the array without violating sortedness.\n\nSo, for each i from 0 to len(arr)-2, the invariant holds true and proves partial correctness of the provided Python program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    t = 0\n    while t <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = t + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[t]:\n                temp = arr[t]\n                arr[t] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        t += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u5b83\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u4ece\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u9009\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\uff08\u6216\u6700\u5927\uff09\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5b58\u653e\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5168\u90e8\u5f85\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5143\u7d20\u6392\u5b8c\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u7528\u4e8e\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u6bcf\u6b21\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u7d22\u5f15t\u90fd\u4f1a\u5411\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4f4d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u662f\uff1a`arr[t] <= arr[t+1] <= ... <= arr[z-1] <= arr[z]`\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u8981\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5e2e\u52a9\uff0c\u8bf7\u968f\u65f6\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff01"}]
