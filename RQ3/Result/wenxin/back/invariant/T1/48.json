The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`count_value_i = give_count(arr[i-1], arr[i])`\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `count_value` is used to keep track of the number of occurrences of the target value in the current iteration.\n* `i` is used as a counter to iterate through the array.\n* The while loop condition `i < len(arr)` ensures that the loop continues until all elements in the array have been processed.\n* If `arr[i] == target`, then `count_value` is incremented by 1.\n* The invariant ensures that `count_value_i` represents the number of occurrences of the target value in the current iteration, based on the previous and current elements in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is `count_value_i = give_count(arr[i-1], arr[i])`.
