Insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that works by placing unsorted items into their correct position in the array one by one by reference comparison.\n\nNow, let's talk about the loop invariant you are requested to provide for the i-th iteration of the loop. An invariant of a loop is a statement that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop, and which usually helps us prove the correctness of the loop.\n\nFor the insertion sort algorithm, the invariant for the i-th iteration would be:\n\n* `arr[i] <= arr[i + 1] <= ... <= arr[j]` for some j > i, where j is the position of the last element that has been sorted.\n\nThis invariant ensures that we are always moving forward in the array one by one and do not skip any elements. Also, it helps us prove that the algorithm eventually sorts the entire array because if we keep moving forward like this, the entire array will eventually be sorted.\n\nNow, here's your invariant:\n\n```python\narr[i]_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[j]) for some j > i\n```\nRemember that `arr[i]->arr[j]` represents a comparison between `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.\n\nSo, with this invariant, we can prove the correctness of the algorithm:\n\n* Before the first iteration (i = 0), `arr[i]_value` is undefined because there are no elements to compare yet.\n* During each iteration, we move to the next element (`i += 1`), and we also compare `arr[i]` with all previous elements (while z > 0), which maintains the invariant because `j` increases as we compare.\n* After finishing all elements, `arr[i]_value` becomes `True` for all values of i because there are no more elements to compare and everything is sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The insertion sort algorithm satisfies the loop invariant you provided for each iteration to prove its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5b83\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5217\u8868`arr`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5bf9\u5176\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u5217\u8868\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d2\u5165\u5143\u7d20\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5217\u8868\u3002\n\n\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u90fd\u4f1a\u79fb\u52a8`i`\u6307\u9488\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002\u5982\u679c`i`\u6307\u5411\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5927\u4e8e\u5176\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c31\u4f1a\u5c06\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u79fb\u52a8`i`\u4ee5\u7ee7\u7eed\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u5e8f\u597d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6216\u5230\u8fbe\u5217\u8868\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\n\n\u81f3\u4e8e\u4f60\u63d0\u5230\u7684\u201c\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u201d\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u5728\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f60\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\uff08`arr[i]_value`\uff09\u662f\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc1\u660e\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u8868\u793a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\uff08`arr[i]`\uff09\u7684\u503c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5b83\u603b\u662f\u5c0f\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u4e8e\u5176\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u65f6\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f97\u5230\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u5217\u8868\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e86\u4f60\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u3002"}]
