Loop invariant is a statement that holds true at each iteration of the loop and helps us prove the correctness of the loop.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the provided program can be stated as:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i-1]`\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. Initially, all elements in the array are initially equal to each other (arr[i] <= arr[i-1]).\n2. The inner while loop checks if there is a greater element before i. If it exists, it moves it one position ahead by swapping them with the i-th element. This process continues until no such element exists or we reach the end of the array.\n3. After this process, the i-th element becomes the smallest element in its group (arr[i] <= arr[i-1]).\n4. The outer while loop then moves i one position ahead, so that we can process the next group of elements in the same manner.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the provided program is `arr[i] <= arr[i-1]`. This invariant proves that the insertion sort algorithm is working correctly by maintaining the sorted order of the array elements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = 0\n    while p <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        p += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5728\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u53d8\u91cf `i`\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u800c\u4e0d\u5305\u542b\u4e0b\u5212\u7ebf\u3002\u6211\u5047\u8bbe\u4f60\u60f3\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662f `p` \u548c `arr`\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = 0\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = p\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        p += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6309\u7167\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b50\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u6700\u7ec8\u6309\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u73b0\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u63a5\u6536\u4efb\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u53ef\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
