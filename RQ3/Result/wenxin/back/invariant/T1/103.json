[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

If the given ID is found in the array (`d == id`), then `member_value` will be updated with the value of the member with that ID. This is correct because if you want to find a member with a given ID, you need to update `member_value` with the correct value.\n2. If the given ID is not found in the array (`d != id`), then the loop will continue to iterate (`d < len(arr)`), and `member_value` will remain unchanged.
