To prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\nLoop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n**a_value = fun(arr[a]->arr[a])**: This loop invariant states that at each iteration, the value of 'a' is the index of the current element in the array.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The function starts by initializing 'id_value' to -1, indicating that there is no previous 'id' for the target value.\n* Then it enters a while loop, which continues as long as 'a' is less than the length of the array.\n* Inside the loop, it checks if 'arr[a] == target', which means it is looking for the target value at the current index 'a'.\n* If it finds the target value, it assigns 'id_value' with 'a', indicating that this is the index of the target value.\n* Finally, it increments 'a' by 1, moving to the next element in the array.\n* The loop continues until it reaches the end of the array, and then it returns 'id_value'.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe provided Python program fulfills its purpose of finding the index of a target value in an array and returning its id.
