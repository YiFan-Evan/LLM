The loop invariant you provided is correct and proves the partial correctness of the function. It ensures that `last_value` always represents the last element of the array.\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The loop starts by setting `last_value` to the first element of the array `arr`.\n* Then, it iterates over the array elements from `h` to `len(arr) - 1`.\n* In each iteration, it updates `last_value` to the current element in the array `arr[h]`.\n* After the loop, `last_value` contains the last element of the array.\n\nTherefore, the function correctly returns the last element of the array."}]
