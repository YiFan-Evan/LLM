The function sorts an array by comparing each element with the ones around it and moving it to its correct position.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program for the i-th iteration, we need to establish an invariant that holds before and after each iteration. The invariant should reflect the state of the array after each iteration, showing that the algorithm is doing what it's supposed to do.\n\nHere's the invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort_invariant(arr, i):\n    return \"arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[j], for all j >= i\"\n```\nThis invariant says that `arr[i]` is smaller than or equal to the elements to its right, including `arr[i+1]`, and so on. It continues to hold for all elements `j` greater than or equal to `i` because that's how insertion sort works: it inserts an element into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.\n\nPlease note that this invariant is formulated based on your provided code, which does not have any i defined within it. The z variable was used within the inner loop and will not be maintained in this invariant.\n\nYou may modify your code as needed based on these conditions.
