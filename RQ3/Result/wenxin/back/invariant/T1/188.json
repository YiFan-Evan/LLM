This invariant is used to prove the correctness of the algorithm by showing that each iteration moves an element to its correct position.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nFor the given selection sort function, the loop invariant for each iteration is `arr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i])`.

The function `selection_sort(arr)` takes an array `arr` as input and sorts it in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.\n\nThe loop invariant for each iteration of the outer while loop is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[i+n-1]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the i-th element of the array is currently in its correct position, and the next element to its right is also smaller than or equal to all elements to its left. This proves the partial correctness of the algorithm.\n\nExplanation of the algorithm:\n\n1. Start from the first element in the array `arr`.\n2. Find the position of the largest element that is smaller than or equal to the current element. This is done by comparing each element with the current element and moving to the next element if it is larger.\n3. Swap the found element with the current element.\n4. Continue this process for all elements in the array, moving to the next element after each swap.\n5. Continue until all elements have been processed, and the array is sorted in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The function `selection_sort(arr)` sorts an array `arr` using selection sort algorithm, and returns a sorted array."}]
