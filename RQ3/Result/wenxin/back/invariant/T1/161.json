Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by making use of the elements of the unsorted part of the array to find their correct positions in the sorted order.\n\nNow, for the i-th iteration of the loop, we can provide an invariant that helps us prove the partial correctness of the code:\n\n**Invariant for the i-th iteration**: `arr[i] <= arr[i-1] <= ... <= arr[0]`\n\n* The above invariant ensures that arr[i] is sorted after the first insertion.\n* Then, it iterates over the rest of the array elements, checking if they are in their correct position after each insertion.\n\nThis invariant assumes that `i` starts from 1 because the insertion sort algorithm iterates over each element individually, so we have `i` being incremented for each element in the array.\n\nNow, let's explain how this invariant helps us prove the partial correctness of the code:\n\n* Initially, `arr[i]` is greater than or equal to all elements in the array, so it needs to be moved to its correct position.\n* After moving `arr[i]` to its correct position, it becomes smaller than all elements in its previous position, so it can be safely moved to its next position.\n* This process continues until `arr[i]` is smaller than all elements in its current position, indicating that it has been moved to its final position.\n\nTherefore, based on this invariant, we can prove that the insertion sort algorithm is partially correct and correctly sorts the array elements one by one."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = 0\n    while b <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        b += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`z`\u662f\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5185\u7f6e\u7684\u6807\u8bc6\u7b26\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u7ed9\u5b83\u4eec\u8d4b\u4e88\u65b0\u7684\u540d\u5b57\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u5728while\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662f`arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e4b\u524d\u7684while\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u6539\u53d8\u4e86`z`\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u4f60\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u6b63\u5728\u68c0\u67e5\u7684\u662f`arr[b - 1] > arr[b]`\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5c31\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u3002\n\n\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u60f3\u7528\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u4e0b\u6807\uff08\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\uff09\u6765\u8868\u793a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u5c06\u4fee\u6b63\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u53d8\u91cf`index_before`\u548c`index_now`\u6765\u8868\u793a\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for index_now in range(1, len(arr)):  # \u4ece\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\n        index_before = index_now - 1  # \u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\n        if arr[index_now] < arr[index_before]:  # \u5982\u679c\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5c0f\u4e8e\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\n            temp = arr[index_now]  # \u4ea4\u6362\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\n            arr[index_now], arr[index_before] = arr[index_before], temp  # \u4ea4\u6362\u4f4d\u7f6e\n        else:\n            continue  # \u5982\u679c\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u597d\u5e8f\uff0c\u8df3\u8fc7\u672c\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6309\u7167\u4f60\u7684\u9884\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ea\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u3002"}]
