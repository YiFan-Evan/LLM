The invariant you should prove for each iteration of the loop is:\n\n\n```less\narr[i].value = fun(arr[i]->arr[i])\n```\nwhere `arr[i]` is the element in the i-th position of the array, `arr[i].value` is its value, and `fun(arr[i]->arr[i])` is the function that you want to apply to it.\n\nInsertion sort works by inserting each element into its correct position in a sorted subarray. It assumes that the array is initially unsorted, but that it contains elements that are already in sorted order. It uses the first element in the array as the first element of the sorted subarray. Then, it proceeds by moving elements one position at a time until the whole array is sorted.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of your insertion sort algorithm, let's consider each iteration of the loop. For simplicity, let's assume that arr[i] is the i-th smallest element in the array (as you do not seem to sort based on any specific key). Then, at each iteration of the inner loop, we are trying to move this element into its correct position within the sorted subarray. We start by comparing it with its current position in the array. If it is greater than its current position, we move it to its correct position by moving elements up until we find a position where it fits.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nIn each iteration of the outer loop, `arr[i].value` is equal to `fun(arr[i]->arr[i])` where `fun(arr[i]->arr[i])` is the function that moves `arr[i]` to its correct position within the sorted subarray.\n\nThis proves that your insertion sort algorithm works correctly for each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`i`\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`z`\u3002\u6211\u5047\u8bbe\u4f60\u662f\u60f3\u8981\u5728`arr[z - 1]`\u5904\u63d2\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u79f0`arr[e]`\u3002\u8bf7\u770b\u4ee5\u4e0b\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u7248\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for e in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[e]\n        j = e - 1\n        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4f5c\u4e3a\u952e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5c06\u5176\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5b83\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u952e\u4e0e\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u79fb\u52a8\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u8f93\u5165\u6570\u7ec4\u5df2\u7ecf\u6309\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5217\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u6309\u7167\u964d\u5e8f\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u7a0d\u5fae\u4fee\u6539\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5982\u5f52\u5e76\u6392\u5e8f\u6216\u5feb\u901f\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
