Here's a loop invariant that proves the partial correctness of your program:\n\n**Loop invariant**:\n\n\"For each iteration of the loop, the mid_value of the array arr is the same as the mid_value of the array before the current iteration.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Initially, `mid_value = arr[0]` sets the loop invariant for the first iteration.\n* Then, the `while 2 * b < len(arr):` loop checks that we're still within the array bounds and moves on to the next element (`arr[b]`).\n* The `mid_value = arr[b]` statement updates `mid_value` with the next element in the array.\n* The `b += 1` statement moves `b` to the next element in the array.\n* Since we're always updating `mid_value` with the next element in the array, it follows that `mid_value` is indeed the mid value of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nYour code is correct and fulfills its purpose.
