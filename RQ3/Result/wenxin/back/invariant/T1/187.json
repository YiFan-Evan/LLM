The program uses a loop to iterate through the array and swap elements if they are in the wrong order.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program for the i-th iteration of the loop, we can use the following loop invariant:\n\nInvariant: `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[j]` for some j > i\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Initially, the invariant holds for all elements in the array because they are all unique.\n* In the first while loop, we move from index h to the end of the array while comparing each element with the element at index h. If an element is found that is smaller than the element at index h, we swap them. This ensures that the minimum element is always in its correct position at index h.\n* After each swap, we increment h by 1 to move to the next element in the array.\n* The invariant holds for all elements after a swap, because the swapped element is now in its correct position.\n* Since we are always moving towards the end of the array, the invariant will eventually hold for all elements in the array after the loop has finished.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided Python program performs selection sort on an array and maintains the invariant `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[j]` for some j > i during each iteration of the loop, proving its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = h + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[h]:\n                temp = arr[h]\n                arr[h] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u7684Python\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u5269\u4f59\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u6765\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5047\u8bbe\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u6709\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\uff1a\n\n`arr[0] <= arr[1] <= ... <= arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[len(arr)-1]`\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u8bc1\u660e\u3002"}]
