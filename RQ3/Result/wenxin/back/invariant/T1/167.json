Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly inserts a new element into the correct location within an already sorted subarray.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this code, we need to provide a loop invariant for each iteration of the loop. Loop invariant is a statement that holds true before each iteration of the loop and will be true after each iteration of the loop.\n\nFor the i-th iteration of the loop, the invariant might be something like this:\n\n* `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[h]`: This invariant ensures that we are working within a sorted subarray and the new element `arr[i]` will be inserted correctly into its correct position.\n\nNow, let's verify this invariant for each step of the code:\n\n1. Inside the while loop, `h` is increased by 1 after inserting `arr[i]` into its correct position. Therefore, after this operation, `h` is greater than or equal to the index of the last element of the sorted subarray, and this is true after each iteration.\n2. Inside the inner while loop, `z` is decreased by 1 after swapping `arr[z]` and `arr[z - 1]`. Therefore, after this operation, `arr[z - 1]` is the smallest element in its correct position within the sorted subarray. This is also true after each iteration because `z` is decreased by 1 after each iteration and hence ensures that the loop condition `z > 0` remains true after each iteration.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that this code snippet satisfies the loop invariant mentioned above and proves its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49`arr`\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u4f7f\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b8c\u6574\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u6211\u9700\u8981\u77e5\u9053`arr`\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ec0\u4e48\u6837\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u7ed9\u4f60\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u6839\u636e\u4f60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5217\u8868\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u5b83\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff08\u7d22\u5f15\u4e3a1\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u5176\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u79fb\u52a8\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u4e3a\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u817e\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u88ab\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bf7\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff01"}]
