[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The program also assumes that `fun` correctly compares two values and returns the smaller one.

In the provided code, the condition for the `while` loop is incorrect. You want to iterate until the last element in the array is reached, so the condition should be `p < len(arr)`.

If an element is found to be less than the current minimum value, it updates the minimum value. When the end of the array is reached, the minimum value is returned."}]
