It works by selecting the minimum element from each unsorted subarray and moving it to its correct position. Here's an invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n`sorted_j_value = selection_sort(arr[j:])`\n\nThis invariant checks that the subarray starting at `arr[j]` is sorted after the current iteration of the loop. It calls the `selection_sort` function recursively on the unsorted part of the subarray starting at `j+1`.\n\nExplanation of the fundamental principles involved:\n\n1. The selection sort algorithm iterates through each unsorted subarray and finds the minimum element, swapping it with the first element of the subarray. It continues doing this until all elements are sorted.\n2. The invariant ensures that each iteration moves the sorted part of the array one position further towards the end, making it easier to find the minimum element in the next iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_j_value = arr`\n\nAfter each iteration, the sorted subarray starting at `j+1` is returned as the sorted array, which is then used as the input for the next iteration.
