The program contains a loop that iterates over the array elements and inserts each element into its correct position in the sorted array.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be stated as follows:\n\n`arr[i-1] <= arr[i]`\n\nThis invariant is true at the start of each iteration and remains true throughout the iteration. It ensures that each element in the array is smaller than or equal to the element it is being inserted after.\n\nHere's an explanation of how this invariant follows from the code:\n\n* The outer while loop iterates over the array elements. Initially, `r` is zero and `z` is zero.\n* The inner while loop moves `z` backwards through the array until it reaches a position where `arr[z - 1] <= arr[z]` is true. This ensures that `arr[i]` is smaller than or equal to `arr[i-1]` at each iteration.\n* After each iteration of the inner loop, `arr[i-1]` is moved to `arr[i]` and `arr[i]` is moved to its correct position in the sorted array. This ensures that `arr[i-1] <= arr[i]` holds for `arr[i]` at the end of each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant ensures that the array is sorted using insertion sort."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = 0\n    while r <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        r += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b83\u4f3c\u4e4e\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4e2d\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u5305\u62ec\u4efb\u4f55\u6570\u7ec4\u6216\u5217\u8868\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6b65\u9aa4\u5305\u62ec\u5bfb\u627e\u5143\u7d20\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u63d2\u5165\u70b9\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u90e8\u5206\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u5185\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u8d1f\u8d23\u5728\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d2\u5165\u5143\u7d20\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u8fd9\u91cc\u7684\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f60\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u8fd8\u6709\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u8005\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8bf7\u544a\u8bc9\u6211\uff01"}]
