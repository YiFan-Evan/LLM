It's a very basic sorting algorithm that selects the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array, moves it to its correct position, and then proceeds to the next iteration until the entire array is sorted.\n\nThe loop invariant for the `selection_sort` function in this case is:\n\n* `arr_sorted[i] = fun(arr[i])`: This means that the i-th element of the sorted array is equal to the result of applying the selection sort function to the i-th element of the original array.\n\nNow, regarding your question about providing a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop, it's already provided in the code snippet you provided. The invariant ensures that each iteration of the outer loop correctly finds and swaps the minimum element with the first element, resulting in a sorted array after each iteration.\n\nSo, this loop invariant proves that the `selection_sort` function is partially correct, and it performs a valid selection sort algorithm."}]
