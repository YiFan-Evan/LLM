The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Here is the loop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n**`give_sum_value = give_sum(arr[i]`**\n\nIn each iteration, the `give_sum_value` variable is initialized with the sum of the current element of the array `arr[i]` with all the previous sum values (`sum_value`). This is a recursive way of summing the elements, because each iteration is treating a smaller subset of the array as a whole, but ultimately building a running total of the array elements.\n\n**Explanation of loop invariant**\n\nLoop invariant states that during each iteration of the loop, an equal or stronger condition holds true after executing the loop body. In this case, the invariant ensures that the sum of the elements in the current iteration is added to the previous sum value (`sum_value`). This ensures that the final sum value (`sum_value`) is correct and equal to the function's expected output.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: **`sum_value = fun(arr[i]) + give_sum_value`**. The loop invariant ensures that the value of `sum_value` remains correct throughout the loop execution."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    f = 0\n    while f <= len(arr) - 1:\n        sum_value += arr[f]\n        f += 1\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u4e2aPython\u51fd\u6570\u5df2\u7ecf\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u6c42\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u548c\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2awhile\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u5c06\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u52a0\u5230`sum_value`\u4e0a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06`f`\u589e\u52a01\u3002\u5f53`f`\u5927\u4e8e\u6216\u7b49\u4e8e\u6570\u7ec4\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf1\u65f6\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8fd4\u56de`sum_value`\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\uff0c`f`\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u5b83\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u90fd\u4f1a\u589e\u52a01\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e0a\uff0c\u90fd\u4f1a\u6267\u884c\u4e00\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4f53\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5904\u7406\u5b8c\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6211\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f60\u63cf\u8ff0\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n\n\u5982\u679c\u4f60\u6709\u4efb\u4f55\u5176\u4ed6\u95ee\u9898\u6216\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6b22\u8fce\u968f\u65f6\u5411\u6211\u63d0\u95ee\u3002"}]
