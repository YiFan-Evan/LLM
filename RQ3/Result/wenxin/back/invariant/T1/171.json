The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be written as:\n\n\n```python\narr[i] = fun(arr[i], arr[i - 1])\n```\nIn this loop invariant, `arr[i]` is the current element to be sorted, `arr[i - 1]` is the element immediately preceding it in the array. The `fun` function represents an operation that swaps the current element with the one that is just before it if they are in the wrong order.\n\nNow, let's break down this loop invariant and its purpose:\n\n* The first part of the loop invariant (`arr[i]`) represents the current element being processed.\n* The second part (`arr[i - 1]`) represents the element that precedes it in the sorted array.\n* The operation `fun(arr[i], arr[i - 1])` represents swapping these two elements if they are in the wrong order.\n* The loop invariant is a statement that needs to hold true for each iteration of the loop. It ensures that as long as the loop runs, the elements in the array will be sorted in ascending order.\n\nThis invariant helps prove the partial correctness of your program because it shows that the elements will be sorted correctly within each iteration of the loop. However, it does not prove that the entire array will be sorted because there may be other elements outside of the loop that need to be sorted as well."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u4e0d\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06`i`\u6539\u4e3a`index`\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l < len(arr) - 1:\n        index = l\n        while index > 0 and arr[index - 1] > arr[index]:\n            arr[index], arr[index - 1] = arr[index - 1], arr[index]\n            index -= 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\uff0c\u5b83\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u9010\u4e2a\u6bd4\u8f83\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u628a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u597d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u65b0\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4ecd\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\uff0c\u6bcf\u6b21\u63d2\u5165\u90fd\u4f1a\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u91cd\u590d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u53d7\u4e00\u4e2a\u5217\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u5e8f\u597d\u7684\u5217\u8868\u3002\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u50cf\u8fd9\u6837\u4f7f\u7528\u5b83\uff1a\n\n\n```python\narr = [5, 2, 4, 6, 1, 3]\nsorted_arr = insertion_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # \u8f93\u51fa\uff1a[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```"}]
