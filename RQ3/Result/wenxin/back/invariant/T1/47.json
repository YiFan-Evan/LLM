The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`count_value_i = count_value + h - i`\n\nExplanation:\n\n* `count_value` is the current count of target values.\n* `h` is the current index in the array.\n* `i` is the current iteration of the loop.\n\nIn each iteration, if the current element in the array is equal to the target, `count_value` is incremented by 1. Since `h` increases by 1 after each iteration, this means that the current element `arr[h]` has been checked, and it's possible that `arr[h]` equals `target`. Therefore, `count_value` is incremented.\n\nThe invariant ensures that `count_value_i` represents the number of target values in the array up to and including the i-th iteration of the loop. Therefore, it proves the partial correctness of the program.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `count_value_i = count_value + h - i`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[h] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        h += 1\n    return count_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u5224\u65ad\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u4f1a\u8d85\u51fa\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u6240\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    h = 0\n    while h < len(arr) and arr[h] != target:\n        h += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`while`\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u662f`h < len(arr) and arr[h] != target`\u3002\u8fd9\u610f\u5473\u7740\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u7ee7\u7eed\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u76f4\u5230`arr[h]`\u7b49\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u503c`target`\u6216\u8005`h`\u8d85\u8fc7\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u4f1a\u9519\u8fc7\u4efb\u4f55\u76ee\u6807\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u8fd4\u56de\u6240\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002"}]
