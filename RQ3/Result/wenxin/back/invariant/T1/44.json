If the current value matches the target, `count_value` is incremented by one. This corresponds to adding one to `count_value_i`.\n* After the loop finishes, `count_value` will contain the total number of occurrences of the target value in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is `count_value_i = count_value + e`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[e] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        e += 1\n    return count_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4f60\u5fd8\u8bb0\u4e86\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e2a\u9000\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf`e`\u8fbe\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u51cf\u4e00\u65f6\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u5e94\u8be5\u505c\u6b62\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u50cf\u8fd9\u6837\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr) - 1:  # \u6dfb\u52a0\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\n        if arr[e] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        e += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u5f53\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u5339\u914d\u65f6\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u4e5f\u4f1a\u505c\u6b62\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14`count_value`\u4f1a\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5305\u542b\u6240\u6709\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002"}]
