The loop invariant for each iteration is `member_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, where `xxx` refers to the index of the specific member that is currently being processed.\n\n**Fundamental principles involved in solving it**:\n\n* We start by setting the initial values of `member_value` and `c` to their initial values (set to -1 and 0, respectively).\n* Then, we iterate through the list `arr` until we reach the end of it (`c < len(arr)`).\n* Inside the loop, we check if the current index (`c`) is equal to the ID (`id`) of the specific member we are looking for. If it is, we set `member_value` to the value of the specific member at that index.\n* After each iteration, `c` is increased by 1.\n* Once we have reached the end of the list, we return `member_value`.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is**:\n\nThe loop invariant for each iteration of the `give_member` function is: `member_value = arr[xxx]->arr[xxx]`, where `xxx` refers to the index of the specific member that is currently being processed. This invariant ensures that `member_value` always holds the value of the specific member at the current index in the list."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    c = 0\n    while c <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if c == id:\n            member_value = arr[c]\n        c += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5c31\u662f\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u6761\u4ef6`c == id`\u548c\u7d2f\u52a0\u64cd\u4f5c`c += 1`\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e4b\u95f4\u5e94\u8be5\u6709\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a7a\u683c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5b83\u6ca1\u6709\u6309\u9884\u671f\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u50cf\u8fd9\u6837\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    c = 0\n    while c <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if c == id:\n            member_value = arr[c]\n        c += 1\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u662f\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u7279\u5b9aID\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u5176\u503c\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u8be5\u5143\u7d20\uff0c`member_value`\u5c06\u4f1a\u88ab\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u8be5\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\u3002\u5982\u679c\u6ca1\u6709\u627e\u5230\uff0c`member_value`\u5c06\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u521d\u59cb\u503c-1\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u8fd4\u56de\u627e\u5230\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\u3002"}]
