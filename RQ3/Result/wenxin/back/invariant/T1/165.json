It is maintained by the while loop, which moves the insertion point `f` forward as elements are inserted into the sorted list.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we can use induction. The base case is when `f` is 0, which means there are no elements to sort yet. In this case, the invariant is true because `arr[i]` is not yet in the list.\n\nThe induction step assumes that the invariant holds for some `i` and proves that it holds for `i+1` as well. This is done by showing that each operation in the while loops maintains the invariant. Specifically, each time an element is inserted into the sorted list, it is compared with the element to its left, and if it is greater, it is moved to the left. This ensures that the list remains sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The loop invariant proves that the insertion sort algorithm operates correctly and produces a sorted array at each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    f = 0\n    while f <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        f += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u3002\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f46\u6709\u4e00\u70b9\u9700\u8981\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5728 `while` \u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u66f4\u6b63\u53d8\u91cf `i` \u7684\u8d4b\u503c\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u5728 Python \u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528 `arr[f]` \u800c\u4e0d\u662f `arr[i]`\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u66f4\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    f = 0\n    while f < len(arr) - 1:\n        z = f\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        f += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u662f\u6309\u7167\u5347\u5e8f\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\u67e5\u627e\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u4e86\u5b83\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u5f52\u7eb3\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc1\u660e\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5b83\u5e94\u8be5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u548c\u5b83\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\u3002"}]
