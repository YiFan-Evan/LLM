It assumes that the array contains an odd number of elements, so that the middle element can be found using the index `h` after removing the first element from the array.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in `give_mid` is:\n\n`mid_value_h = fun(arr[mid_value_h]->arr[mid_value_h+1])`\n\nwhere `fun` is a function that takes two adjacent elements of the array and returns their sum.\n\nThe loop invariant ensures that at each iteration, the value of `mid_value` is updated correctly and that it is within the valid range of the array.
