The purpose of the function is to sort a given array `arr`.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program for each iteration of the loop, we need to provide a loop invariant. A loop invariant is a statement that remains true at each iteration of a loop, and it helps us prove the correctness of the loop.\n\nHere's an invariant for the `i`-th iteration of the loop:\n\n`arr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i])`\n\nIn other words, at each iteration, the `i`-th element of the array has been correctly sorted according to insertion sort algorithm.\n\nExplanation of how this invariant ensures partial correctness:\n\n1. Inside the `while z > 0` loop, the `temp` variable is swapped with the `arr[i]` and this operation sorts `arr[i]` in place (within the array).\n2. Then, `arr[i]` is swapped with `arr[i-1]` which shifts all elements above it one position downwards, making room for the newly sorted `arr[i]`.\n3. After the outer loop finishes, `arr[i]` is again swapped with `arr[d+1]` to ensure that it is now correctly placed in its final position in the sorted array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe invariant `arr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i])` ensures that each iteration of the loop correctly sorts the `i`-th element of the array within itself, which proves the partial correctness of the `insertion_sort` function."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = 0\n    while d <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        d += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\u548c`z`\u662f\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u662fPython\u7684\u5185\u7f6e\u5173\u952e\u5b57\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`temp`\u4e5f\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\n\n\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = 0\n    while d < len(arr) - 1:\n        j = d + 1\n        while j > 0 and arr[j - 1] > arr[j]:\n            arr[j], arr[j - 1] = arr[j - 1], arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        d += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u505a\u7684\u662f\uff1a\u6bcf\u6b21\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b50\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u6392\u5e8f\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u76ee\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u91cc\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u9488`j`\uff0c\u5c06`arr[j - 1]`\u4e0e`arr[j]`\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e76\u4ea4\u6362\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5c06`arr[j]`\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u6307\u9488\u5411\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
