The purpose of the algorithm is to sort a given array in ascending order.\n\nInsertion sort is a type of sorting algorithm that works by making use of the concept of \"insertions\" to move elements from one place to another, usually from the beginning of the array to its sorted end. The basic steps are:\n\n1. Find the next unsorted element\n2. Move it to its correct position\n3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for all elements in the array\n\nInsertion sort is usually implemented by using a loop to traverse through the array, starting from the first element (the 'i' in your code). It compares each element with its previous element, and moves it to its correct position if it is greater than its previous element. This process is repeated until the array is fully sorted.\n\nIn order to prove the partial correctness of the `insertion_sort` function, you can use the following loop invariant:\n\n\n```python\ndef invariant(arr):\n    result = [x for x in arr]\n    return \"arr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i+1])\"\n```\nThis invariant states that at each iteration of the loop, `arr[i]` is equal to the result of applying `fun` function (`arr[i]->arr[i+1]`) to `arr[i]` and `arr[i+1]`. This invariant ensures that the loop continues to iterate correctly and that the sorted array is correctly updated at each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the `insertion_sort` function is `invariant(arr)` where `arr` is the input array to be sorted."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = len(arr)\n    while o > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        o -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u4ece\u540e\u5411\u524d\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u76f8\u5e94\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u63d2\u5165\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u57fa\u672c\u4e0a\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u5728`while o > 0`\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`z`\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`i`\u3002\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u6539\u4e3a`while z < len(arr)`\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 1:\n        j = 1\n        while j < n and arr[j - 1] > arr[j]:\n            temp = arr[j]\n            arr[j] = arr[j - 1]\n            arr[j - 1] = temp\n            j += 1\n        n = j\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6309\u7167\u9884\u671f\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5728\u5217\u8868\u957f\u5ea6\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u5217\u8868\u6216\u9700\u8981\u7ecf\u5e38\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}]
