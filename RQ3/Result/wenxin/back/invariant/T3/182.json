The code iterates through the array and compares each element with the element at the current position. If an element is found to be smaller than the current element, it is swapped with the current element. This process continues until the end of the array is reached.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to provide a loop invariant for each iteration of the loop. The loop invariant should describe the state of the array at each iteration and should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.\n\nFor the first iteration, the invariant would be:\n\n* 'sorted_elements_count = 0' - This indicates that there are no yet any elements in the sorted part of the array.\n\nFor the second iteration, the invariant would be:\n\n* 'arr[c] is the largest element in the unsorted part' - This indicates that after swapping, c-th element will be the largest element in the unsorted part.\n\nFor each iteration after that, we need to maintain this invariant and also ensure that the sorted part grows by one element each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n* 'c = len(arr) - 1' - This indicates that we are at the last iteration and we are about to make a swap with the last element in the unsorted part.\n\nSo, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be:\n\n* 'arr[c] = arr[i] > arr[j] for all j from i+1 to len(arr)' - This indicates that after swapping, c-th element will be the largest element in the unsorted part and also that all elements from i+1 to len(arr) are in sorted order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    c = len(arr)\n    while c > 0:\n        c -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[c]:\n                temp = arr[c]\n                arr[c] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4ecd\u7136\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728`while`\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b83\u3002\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`z`\u548c`i`\u5728\u540e\u7eed\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4e5f\u88ab\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\n\n\u6211\u5047\u8bbe\u4f60\u60f3\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf`c`\u548c`z`\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u66f4\u6b63\u4e3a\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    c = len(arr) - 1\n    while c >= 0:\n        z = c\n        while z >= 0:\n            if arr[z] < arr[z + 1]:\n                temp = arr[z]\n                arr[z], arr[z + 1] = arr[z + 1], temp\n            z -= 1\n        c -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u4e0e\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7c7b\u4f3c\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u5c06\u6700\u5927\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u81f3\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5d4c\u5957\u7684\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4ece\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u524d\u9762\u5f00\u59cb\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5927\u5143\u7d20\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5c31\u4ea4\u6362\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u5219\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u5f00\u59cb\u5411\u524d\u904d\u5386\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5927\u5143\u7d20\u5927\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
