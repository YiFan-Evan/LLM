It selects the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array, moves it to its correct position, and repeats this process until the entire array is sorted.\n\nIn order to prove the partial correctness of your program for the i-th iteration of the loop, you can define a loop invariant as:\n\n\"Invariant: 'min_value_i' represents the minimum value in the unsorted part of the array after the i-th iteration.\"\n\nHere's an explanation of how this invariant is used to prove the partial correctness of your program:\n\n1. **Initialization**: At the start of each iteration, 'min_value_i' represents the minimum value in the unsorted part of the array.\n2. **Assumption**: Since the algorithm iterates through each element of the unsorted part and compares it with its neighbors, if an element is smaller than the minimum value found so far, it will be swapped with it. Therefore, 'min_value_i' will always represent the minimum value in the unsorted part after each iteration.\n3. **Conclusion**: Since 'min_value_i' remains unchanged from one iteration to the next, it proves that your program correctly updates 'min_value_i' for each iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of your selection sort program for each iteration of the loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[t]:\n                temp = arr[t]\n                arr[t] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f3c\u4e4e\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e86 `i` \u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u662f\u7528\u6765\u4ee3\u8868\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u5728\u51fd\u6570 `selection_sort` \u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b83\u3002\u6211\u5047\u8bbe\u4f60\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u662f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u5347\u5e8f\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    i = 0\n    while i < n:\n        min_index = i\n        j = i + 1\n        while j < n:\n            if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = j\n            j += 1\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n        i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u65ad\u67e5\u627e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u79fb\u81f3\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u904d\u5386\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u90fd\u628a\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u5230\u5b83\u6700\u540e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u628a\u5269\u4f59\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u91cd\u65b0\u6392\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\uff1a\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u5bfb\u627e\u5e76\u4ea4\u6362\u5f53\u524d\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u3002"}]
