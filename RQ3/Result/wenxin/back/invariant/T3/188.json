Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that finds the minimum element in the array, exchanges it with the first element, finds the next minimum element, exchanges it with the second element, and so on. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[z]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that we are always working with the smallest elements of the array. It is maintained by the inner while loop, which compares each element with the previously found minimum element. If an element is found to be smaller than the minimum, it is swapped with the minimum element.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the outer while loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        i -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u53d8\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4e5f\u5c31\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u6362\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u9009\u5b9a\u5143\u7d20\u53ca\u5176\u524d\u9762\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u4e00\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684Python\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u529f\u80fd\u3002\n\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u5173\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\uff0c\u6211\u7406\u89e3\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u662f\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u90e8\u5206\uff08\u4ece\u7d22\u5f15i\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff09\u662f\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i-1] <= ... <= arr[1] <= arr[0]`\n\n\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u8be5\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b89\u5168\u5730\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u65b0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0a\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6bd4\u5b83\u524d\u9762\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5c0f\u3002\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u8fd9\u5c31\u662f\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\uff1a\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i-1] <= ... <= arr[1] <= arr[0]`\n\n\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e2a\u5faa\u73af\u4e0d\u53d8\u5f0f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u540e\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u662f\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u3002"}]
