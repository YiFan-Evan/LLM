The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`n_value = n`\n\nIn each iteration, we check if the current element `arr[n]` is equal to the target `target`. If it is, we update `id_value` with the current value of `n`. After this iteration, `n` increases by one, which means we're checking the next element.
