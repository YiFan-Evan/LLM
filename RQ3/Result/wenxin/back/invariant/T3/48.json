If it is, we increment count_value by 1.\n* Finally, we move i forward by 1, so that we can check the next element in arr.\n\nThis invariant ensures that count_value correctly represents the number of target values in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `count_value_i = give_count(arr[i:], target)`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        i -= 1\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n    return count_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u7ecf\u975e\u5e38\u63a5\u8fd1\u6b63\u786e\u4e86\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u5728while\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86len(arr)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4f53\u5185\u90e8\u4f60\u53c8\u8bd5\u56fe\u51cf\u5c0f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u503c\u3002\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528i\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u503c\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(arr):\n        if arr[i] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n        i += 1\n    return count_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u7edf\u8ba1\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u503ctarget\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4e2a\u6570\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u68c0\u67e5\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u662f\u5426\u7b49\u4e8etarget\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u662f\uff0c\u5c31\u589e\u52a0count_value\u7684\u503c\u3002\u5f53\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u8fd4\u56decount_value\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u5373\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u503c\u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4e2a\u6570\u3002"}]
