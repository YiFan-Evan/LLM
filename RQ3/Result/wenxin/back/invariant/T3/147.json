This sum is added to `sum_value`.\n* Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `sum_value` contains the correct sum of the elements from `arr[start]` to `arr[i-1]`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the `give_sum` function proves its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    h = len(arr)\n    while h > 0:\n        h -= 1\n        sum_value += arr[h]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u662f\u5bf9\u7684\uff0c\u5b83\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570`give_sum`\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u63a5\u6536\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4`arr`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u548c\u3002\n\n\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728while\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`h > 0`\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4f53\u4e2d\u4f60\u53c8\u5c06`h`\u51cf\u53bb\u4e861\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5faa\u73af\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u4e3a`h < 0`\uff0c\u8fd9\u663e\u7136\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\n\n\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    h = len(arr)\n    while h > 0:\n        sum_value += arr[h-1]\n        h -= 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u5f53\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\uff0c`h`\u5c06\u4e3a0\uff0c\u5faa\u73af\u6761\u4ef6\u5c06\u4e0d\u518d\u6ee1\u8db3\uff0c\u51fd\u6570\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u548c\u3002"}]
