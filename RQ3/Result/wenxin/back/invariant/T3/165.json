Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly inserts a new element into the correct position in a sorted list.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to provide a loop invariant for each iteration of the loop. Loop invariant is a statement that holds true at the beginning of each iteration of a loop and helps us prove the correctness of the loop.\n\nHere's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n\n```python\narr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i])\n```\nNow, let's explain how this invariant helps us prove the partial correctness of the program:\n\n1. **Initialization**: The loop invariant ensures that arr[i] is initially set to its correct value before the first iteration.\n2. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop compares arr[i] with its neighbors and swaps if necessary. It moves arr[i] to its correct position in the sorted list. The invariant ensures that after each inner loop iteration, arr[i] is correctly placed in its correct position within its group of adjacent elements.\n3. **Outermost Loop**: After completing the inner loop for all elements in the array, the outer loop moves to the next element and repeats the process. The invariant ensures that after completing all iterations, the entire array is sorted in ascending order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe provided code implements insertion sort algorithm for an array and has a loop invariant that ensures the partial correctness of each iteration. The invariant correctly initializes arr[i] to its correct value, places it correctly within its group of adjacent elements, and ensures that after completing all iterations, the entire array is sorted in ascending order."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    f = len(arr)\n    while f > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        f -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u903b\u8f91\u662f\uff1a\n\n1. \u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf`f`\uff0c\u5b83\u8868\u793a\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002\n2. \u5f53`f`\u5927\u4e8e0\u65f6\uff0c\u8fdb\u5165\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u3002\n3. \u5728\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u67e5\u627e\u9700\u8981\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u524d\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7684\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5927\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5c31\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u4ea4\u6362\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u7ed3\u675f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5411\u524d\u79fb\u52a8\u4e00\u4f4d\u3002\n4. \u5f53\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\uff0c`f`\u51cf1\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e0b\u4e00\u6b21\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u3002\n5. \u5f53\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u6392\u5e8f\u540e\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf`f`\u3002\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u5c06\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u7684`z = i`\u66f4\u6539\u4e3a`z = f - 1`\u3002\n\n\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5982\u4e0b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    f = len(arr)\n    while f > 1:\n        for i in range(1, f):\n            temp = arr[i]\n            j = i - 1\n            while j >= 0 and arr[j] > temp:\n                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n                j -= 1\n            arr[j + 1] = temp\n        f -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5c31\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e86\u3002"}]
