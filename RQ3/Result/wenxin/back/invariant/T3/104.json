The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is: `member_value_i = arr[i]`\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The loop invariant ensures that the value of the member at the current index `i` is updated correctly during each iteration of the loop.\n* The `member_value` variable is initialized to -1, indicating that no member has been found yet.\n* The `e` variable is used to iterate through the list.\n* If the current index `e` matches the ID `id`, then the value of the member at that index is stored in `member_value`.\n* After each iteration, `e` is incremented by 1 to move to the next index in the list.\n* The loop continues until `e` reaches the length of the list, indicating that all members have been checked.\n* Finally, the function returns the value of `member_value` at the end of the loop, which corresponds to the member with the specified ID.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the `give_member` function ensures that `member_value_i = arr[i]` holds true for each iteration of the loop, proving the partial correctness of the program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    e = len(arr)\n    while e > 0:\n        e -= 1\n        if e == id:\n            member_value = arr[e]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7ed9\u51fa\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u5b83\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u8bd5\u56fe\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u8d1f\u6570\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u662f\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4f7f\u7528`e - 1`\u800c\u4e0d\u662f`e`\u3002\n\n\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5730\u65b9\uff0c\u90a3\u5c31\u662f\u4f60\u8bd5\u56fe\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u524d\u4f7f\u7528`e > 0`\u6765\u7ee7\u7eed\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u901a\u5e38\u610f\u5473\u7740\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u5f53\u6570\u7ec4\u975e\u7a7a\u65f6\u7ee7\u7eed\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f60\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u5df2\u7ecf\u5230\u672b\u5c3e\u4e86\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6211\u5bf9\u4f60\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7248\u672c\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if i == id:\n            member_value = arr[i]\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4f1a\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u4e0eID\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u4e3a\u6b62\u3002\u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u8fd4\u56de\u8be5\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\u3002\u5426\u5219\uff0c\u5b83\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de-1\u3002"}]
