The invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.\n\nHere's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n* 'sorted_elements_count_i': This is the number of elements in the sorted part of the array after the i-th iteration. Initially, it is 0.\n\n* 'current_element_i': This is the current element in the array that is being sorted at the i-th iteration.\n\n* 'previous_element_i': This is the element immediately before the current element in the array that is being sorted at the i-th iteration.\n\nHere's how the loop invariant can be used to prove the partial correctness of the program:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Initially, all elements in the array are unsorted, so 'sorted_elements_count_i' = 0 and 'current_element_i' = x, where x is any element in the array.\n2. **Loop invariant check**: The first check for loop invariant should be before the inner while loop. Initially, since there are no elements in the sorted part of the array, 'sorted_elements_count_i' = 0. Also, since there are no elements to compare with, 'previous_element_i' = x'.\n3. **Inner loop**: Inside the inner while loop, if z is increased, 'previous_element_i' is also increased. Hence, it is correct to say that 'previous_element_i - 1' has been checked to be smaller than 'current_element_i' by moving to the next position in the array.\n4. **Exit condition**: After finishing the inner loop, 'current_element_i' has been moved to its correct position in the sorted part of the array. Hence, 'sorted_elements_count_i' is incremented by 1.\n5. **Loop invariant check again**: After finishing the outer while loop, 'sorted_elements_count_i' will be equal to the number of elements in the sorted part of the array after finishing the i-th iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant correctly proves that each iteration of the insertion sort algorithm moves an element to its correct position in the sorted part of the array, resulting in a sorted array after finishing all iterations."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    m = len(arr)\n    while m > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        m -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684Python\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd8\u9644\u5e26\u4e86\u60f3\u8981\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u4e0d\u8fc7\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u63d0\u51fa\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6211\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4e3a\u4f60\u63d0\u4f9b\u89e3\u7b54\u3002\u4f60\u53ef\u4ee5\u66f4\u8be6\u7ec6\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f60\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u6216\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u65f6\u9047\u5230\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u4f60\u60f3\u8981\u8ba8\u8bba\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u6211\u624d\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e2e\u52a9\u4f60\u3002"}]
