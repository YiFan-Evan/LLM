The function sorts an array by inserting each element into its correct position in the sorted order.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n* `arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[g]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order as the loop iterates. The invariant is based on the comparison operations within the loop body.\n\nThe algorithm works by iterating over the array, inserting each element into its correct position within the sorted order. At each iteration, the outer loop (`while g < len(arr)`), moves one element to the right in the array until it reaches its correct position. The inner loop (`while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`) compares each element with its right neighbor and swaps them if necessary to maintain the sorted order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop.
