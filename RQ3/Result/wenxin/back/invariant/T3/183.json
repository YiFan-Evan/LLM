The program uses a nested loop to compare each element in the array with the first element, and then with the second element, and so on. If an element is found to be smaller than the first element, it is swapped with the first element. If it is found to be smaller than the second element, it is swapped with the second element, and so on.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop (while d < len(arr)) is:\n\n`arr[d] = fun(arr[d]->arr[d+1])`\n\nIn this case, `fun` refers to the selection sort algorithm that swaps elements if they are in the wrong order.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to show that after each iteration of the outer loop, the array remains sorted.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* At the start of each iteration, `d` is incremented by 1. This means that `arr[d]` will now be the next unsorted element in the array.\n* The inner loop compares `arr[z]` with `arr[d]`. If `arr[z]` is smaller than `arr[d]`, it means that `arr[z]` should be swapped with `arr[d]`.\n* After swapping, `arr[d]` becomes the next unsorted element in the array, and `z` is incremented by 1.\n* Since `d` is incremented at the end of each iteration, it will eventually cover all unsorted elements in the array.\n* Therefore, after each iteration of the outer loop, the array will be sorted.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided Python program correctly implements selection sort on an array and maintains its partial correctness after each iteration of the outer loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    d = len(arr)\n    while d > 0:\n        d -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[d]:\n                temp = arr[d]\n                arr[d] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8ba9\u6211\u4eec\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63\u5b83\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u5e94\u8be5\u88ab\u66f4\u6539\u4e3a`d`\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e9b\u7b26\u53f7\uff08\u4f8b\u5982`<`\u548c`>`\uff09\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6b63\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u66f4\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        min_index = n - 1\n        for i in range(n):\n            if arr[i] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = i\n        arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]\n        n -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b21\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b83\u90fd\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u5269\u4f59\u5143\u7d20\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u5c31\u4f1a\u88ab\u79fb\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\n\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5d4c\u5957\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u3002\u5916\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u63a7\u5236\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u8f6e\u6570\uff0c\u5185\u90e8\u5faa\u73af\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u4ea4\u6362\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u5728\u4ea4\u6362\u6570\u7ec4\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528Python\u7684\u89e3\u6784\u8d4b\u503c\u6765\u540c\u65f6\u4ea4\u6362\u4e24\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u8fd4\u56de\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u3002"}]
