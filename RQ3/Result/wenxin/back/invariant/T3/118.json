To prove the partial correctness of this function, we need to establish a loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop.\n\nHere's the loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration:\n\n\n```less\n's_value = fun(arr[s]->arr[id])'\n```\nNow, let's break down what this invariant means:\n\n* `s_value` refers to the value of `s` after applying `fun(arr[s]->arr[id])` to the current `s` value and `arr[id]`.\n* `fun(arr[s]->arr[id])` is a function that takes the current element at index `s` and returns its value if it is equal to `arr[id]`, otherwise it returns -1.\n\nNow, let's explain the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. **Loop invariant**: The loop invariant ensures that the value of `s` remains within the bounds of the array at each iteration. It also ensures that at each iteration, we are considering an element that might be equal to `arr[id]`.\n2. **Proof**: We need to prove that at each iteration of the loop, the value of `member_value` is equal to `arr[id]` if `s == id` is true. Otherwise, it will remain -1. This is because at each iteration, we only consider elements that might be equal to `arr[id]` based on the loop invariant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAssuming the loop invariant is maintained, the final value of `member_value` will be equal to `arr[id]` if `s == id` is true, otherwise it will remain -1. This proves the partial correctness of the `give_member` function."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    s = len(arr)\n    while s > 0:\n        s -= 1\n        if s == id:\n            member_value = arr[s]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u8bd5\u56fe\u901a\u8fc7 `s -= 1` \u6765\u51cf\u5c11 `s` \u7684\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u8fd9\u4e2a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd `arr` \u7684\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u65e0\u9650\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0b\u53bb\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u4e3a\u7a7a\u3002\n\n\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u4fee\u6539\u4e3a\u4ee5\u4e0b\u5f62\u5f0f\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if i == id:\n            member_value = arr[i]\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u5f53\u9047\u5230\u4e0e\u7ed9\u5b9a `id` \u76f8\u7b49\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u8be5\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u503c\u8d4b\u7ed9 `member_value`\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u540e\u4ecd\u672a\u627e\u5230\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c`member_value` \u5c06\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u521d\u59cb\u503c -1\u3002\n\n\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u5047\u8bbe `arr` \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5217\u8868\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14 `id` \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u3002\u5982\u679c\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u671f\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u6dfb\u52a0\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u67e5\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u5904\u7406\u3002"}]
