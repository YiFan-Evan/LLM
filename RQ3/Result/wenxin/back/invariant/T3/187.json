Selection sort is an in-place sorting algorithm that selects the minimum element in each iteration and swaps it with the first element of the array.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n* `arr[i]` has not been swapped with any other element yet.\n\nThis invariant ensures that we are working with the original array elements during each iteration and not with any swapped ones. It also ensures that the algorithm moves in the right direction to find the minimum element.\n\nHere's why:\n\n* Initially, `arr[i]` is unswapped and thus represents the current minimum element in the array.\n* Inside the inner while loop, if `arr[z]` is found to be smaller than `arr[i]`, it means `arr[i]` is being updated, indicating that `arr[i]` has been found to be the minimum element so far.\n* When the inner loop ends, `arr[i]` is incremented, indicating that it has not been swapped with any other element yet.\n* Finally, `arr[i]` is incremented again in the outer loop, indicating that we are still considering `arr[i]` as the minimum element for the next iteration.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Therefore, the provided Python program fulfills the requirements of selection sort algorithm and has a loop invariant that proves its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    h = len(arr)\n    while h > 0:\n        h -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[h]:\n                temp = arr[h]\n                arr[h] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u5c1d\u8bd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5728`while`\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5728\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b83\u3002\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u53d8\u91cf`z`\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    h = len(arr) - 1\n    while h >= 0:\n        # Find the minimum element in the unsorted part\n        min_index = h\n        for i in range(h, 0, -1):\n            if arr[i] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = i\n        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part\n        arr[h], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[h]\n        h -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u662f\u8fd9\u6837\u7684\uff1a\u5728\u6bcf\u4e00\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f1a\u627e\u5230\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u9010\u6e10\u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u5f00\u59cb\u90e8\u5206\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e00\u76f4\u6301\u7eed\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
