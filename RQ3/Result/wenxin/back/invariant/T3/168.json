It does so by moving elements to the right side of `arr[i]` until it finds a position that is less than or equal to `arr[i]`.\n\nIn terms of a loop invariant, the invariant for the `i`th iteration of the outer loop would be:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[len(arr)-1]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that `arr[i]` is inserted into its correct position within the sorted list, which is at the rightmost position where it is less than or equal to all elements that precede it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm ensures that each element `arr[i]` is inserted into its correct position within the sorted list.
