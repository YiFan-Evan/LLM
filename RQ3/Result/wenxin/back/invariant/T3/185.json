The program uses a loop to iterate through the array and swap elements if they are in the wrong order.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program for the i-th iteration of the loop, we can define a loop invariant that ensures the elements are swapped correctly within the bounds of the while loops. Here's an example of such an invariant:\n\nLoop invariant for i-th iteration:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= arr[i+2] <= ... <= arr[f-1]`\n\nExplanation:\n\n* Initially, the invariant is true because the program starts with the first element in the array (arr[i=0]).\n* In the first while loop, if `arr[z] < arr[f]` is true, it means `arr[z]` is a smaller element after swapping, so `arr[f]` should be swapped with `arr[z]` and moved back to its original position, ensuring that `arr[z]` becomes `arr[f]`. Then `arr[i]` is compared again with `arr[z+1]` to verify that swapping did not move it backwards.\n* In the second while loop, once `arr[f]` has been swapped to its new position (making it larger than any elements after it), it continues moving up through `arr[i+1]` to verify that all elements larger than `arr[f]` have been properly sorted.\n* Finally, `f` is incremented by 1 to check the next element after `arr[f]`.\n\nTherefore, at each iteration of the loop, the invariant ensures that `arr[i]` is either equal to or greater than all elements in its current position and greater than or equal to all elements after it. This proves that the program correctly sorts the array."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    f = len(arr)\n    while f > 0:\n        f -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[f]:\n                temp = arr[f]\n                arr[f] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u4f60\u5728`selection_sort`\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`i`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u5b83\u3002\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`z`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u770b\u5230\u5b83\u88ab\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u4ea4\u6362\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`temp`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u770b\u5230\u5b83\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u7248\u672c\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        n -= 1\n        i = 0\n        while i < n:\n            if arr[i] < arr[(i+1)%n]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[(i+1)%n]\n                arr[(i+1)%n] = temp\n            i += 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b83\u4f1a\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u672b\u5c3e\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5b83\u4f1a\u518d\u6b21\u904d\u5386\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u5269\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u653e\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f1a\u4e00\u76f4\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u6a21\u8fd0\u7b97\u6765\u5904\u7406\u6570\u7ec4\u4e0b\u6807\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5728\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002"}]
