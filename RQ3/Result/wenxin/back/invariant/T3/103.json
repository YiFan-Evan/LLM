The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`member_value_i = arr[id_i]`\n\nHere's why:\n\n* The `member_value` variable is initialized to -1, indicating that it is not yet known which member has been found.\n* The `d` variable is used to iterate through the list `arr`.\n* When `d` equals the ID (`id`), the corresponding value is found and stored in `member_value`.\n* After each iteration, `d` is increased by 1 to continue searching for the next member.\n* Once all members have been checked, the function returns the value of `member_value` as the final result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `member_value_i = arr[id_i]` for each iteration of the loop.
