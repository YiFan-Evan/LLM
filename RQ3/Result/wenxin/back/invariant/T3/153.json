We use `+=` operation in this formula, so the effect of applying `fun` on an element will be added to `sum_value`.\n\nLet's use an example array to demonstrate the function. Assume that `arr` is a list of integers like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n\n* The first iteration of the loop will start with `n = 0` and `arr[n] = 1`. `fun(1)->1` is applied, which adds `1` to `sum_value`.\n* The second iteration of the loop will start with `n = 1` and `arr[n] = 2`. Again, `fun(2)->2` is applied, which adds `2` to `sum_value`.\n* The process continues until `n` reaches the length of the array, which is `5` in our example. At this point, all elements have been processed and `sum_value` contains the sum of all elements in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant correctly proves the partial correctness of the provided Python program code for calculating the sum of all elements in an array using a while loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        n -= 1\n        sum_value += arr[n]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728Python\u4e2d\uff0c\u5217\u8868\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u662f\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4f60\u7684`n`\u53d8\u91cf\u5e94\u8be5\u4ece1\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5728`while`\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d`n < len(arr)`\u5e94\u6539\u4e3a`n <= len(arr)`\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    n = 1  # \u5217\u8868\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u662f\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u4ece1\u5f00\u59cb\n    while n <= len(arr):  # \u8fd9\u91cc\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\n        sum_value += arr[n - 1]  # \u5c06 n - 1 \u66ff\u6362 n \uff0c\u8fd9\u6837\u4f60\u5c31\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\n        n += 1\n    return sum_value\n```\n\u73b0\u5728\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u4f1a\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u548c\u3002"}]
