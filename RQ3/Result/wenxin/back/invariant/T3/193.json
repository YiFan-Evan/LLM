Selection sort is an efficient sorting algorithm that selects the minimum element in each iteration and swaps it with the first element of the array.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to provide a loop invariant for each iteration of the loop. A loop invariant is a statement that holds true before each iteration and remains unchanged after each iteration.\n\nFor the i-th iteration of the loop, the invariant would be:\n\n* `arr[i] <= arr[i+1]`\n\nThis invariant ensures that the elements in the array are sorted in ascending order after each iteration of the loop.\n\nHere's the proof:\n\n1. Before the first iteration, all elements in the array are initially in random order, so the invariant holds true for all indices i (i < len(arr)).\n2. Inside the outer while loop, the `z` variable is incremented until it reaches the end of the array. This ensures that all elements are checked for their order with respect to the first element (index n).\n3. If `arr[z] < arr[n]` is true, then `arr[z]` is smaller than `arr[i]` (the first element of the array). Therefore, swapping `arr[n]` and `arr[z]` will ensure that `arr[n]` becomes the smallest element in its current position after the swap.\n4. After each iteration, `n` is incremented by 1, which means that the next element in the array becomes the first element for the next iteration.\n5. Since `n` is incremented after each swap, it ensures that only valid swaps are performed and no element is overwritten or left unswapped.\n6. After completing all iterations, the array will be sorted in ascending order as per the provided loop invariant.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The provided Python program fulfills its purpose of performing selection sort on a given array using a loop invariant that proves its partial correctness."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        n -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[n]:\n                temp = arr[n]\n                arr[n] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u50cf\u662f\u8bd5\u56fe\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u548c`z`\u4f3c\u4e4e\u88ab\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u3002\u5728\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u91cf`i`\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f53\u524d\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u8d77\u59cb\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u800c`z`\u7528\u4e8e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5f85\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        # \u627e\u5230\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\n        min_index = n\n        for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n            if arr[i] < arr[min_index]:\n                min_index = i\n        # \u4ea4\u6362\u5f53\u524d\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\u548c\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\n        arr[n], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[n]\n        n -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u9996\u5148\u627e\u5230\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4ea4\u6362\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u5143\u7d20\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662fO(n^2)\uff0c\u5176\u4e2dn\u662f\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u3002"}]
