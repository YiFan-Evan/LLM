The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be expressed as `count_value_i = give_count(arr[start_i:end_i])`.\n\nIn each iteration, we check if the current element of the array (arr[r]) is equal to the target value (target). If it is, we increment the count_value by 1. After the current element has been checked, r is increased by 1 to skip to the next element.\n\nThis process is repeated until we reach the end of the array, which is when r will exceed the length of the array. The final count_value will then be the number of occurrences of the target value in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `count_value_i = give_count(arr[i:i+len(arr)-1])` for each i from 0 to len(arr)-1.
