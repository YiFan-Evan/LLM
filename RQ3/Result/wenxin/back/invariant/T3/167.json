Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly inserts a new element into the correct location within an already sorted subarray.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this code, we need to provide a loop invariant for each iteration of the loop. Loop invariant is a statement that holds true before each iteration of the loop and will be true after each iteration of the loop.\n\nHere's the loop invariant for the i-th iteration:\n\n\n```python\narr_sorted = True\n```\nExplanation:\n\n* `arr_sorted` is initially set to `True`, indicating that the array is initially sorted.\n* In the first while loop, we move the elements in the array to their correct positions within the sorted subarray. This is done by moving elements up until we find the correct position for `arr[z]`. If `arr[z]` is greater than its previous position, we swap it with the element above it and decrement `z`. This ensures that `arr[z]` will always be placed correctly within the sorted subarray.\n* After each iteration of the first while loop, `h` will increment by 1, indicating that we have processed one more element in the array. This is a part of the algorithm where we are inserting elements into the sorted subarray.\n* The final result will be returned in the end as `arr`, which is our final sorted array.\n\nTherefore, based on these premises, we can conclude that this code snippet implements insertion sort correctly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = len(arr)\n    while h > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        h -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u662f\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u6ca1\u4ec0\u4e48\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u597d\u5e8f\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f97\u5230\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u3001\u4e2a\u6570\u52a0\u4e00\u7684\u6709\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e3aO(n^2)\u3002\n\n\u5173\u4e8e\u4f60\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u7ec4\u4e0b\u6807\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u6211\u5c06\u4fee\u590d\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = len(arr) - 1\n    while h >= 0:\n        for i in range(h, 0, -1):\n            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:\n                arr[i], arr[i - 1] = arr[i - 1], arr[i]\n        h -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4fee\u590d\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4ece\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u9010\u4e2a\u5411\u524d\u68c0\u67e5\u3002\u5982\u679c\u5f53\u524d\u5143\u7d20\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5176\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5c31\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u4ea4\u6362\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u5f53\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u675f\u65f6\uff0c\u6570\u7ec4\u5c31\u5df2\u7ecf\u6392\u597d\u5e8f\u4e86\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5916\u5c42\u5faa\u73af\u4f1a\u7ee7\u7eed\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4ece\u5012\u6570\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u6211\u4eec\u5df2\u7ecf\u77e5\u9053\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u5df2\u7ecf\u88ab\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e86\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u4e00\u76f4\u5faa\u73af\u5230\u6570\u7ec4\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u5c31\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u6574\u4e2a\u6392\u5e8f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}]
