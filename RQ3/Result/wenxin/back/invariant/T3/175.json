The invariant you're looking for is an assertion that helps us verify the correctness of the algorithm's execution at each iteration.\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in your code would be:\n\n`arr[i] = fun(arr[i]->arr[i])`\n\nIn this case, `fun` is the function that sorts the element `arr[i]` with the previous element `arr[i-1]`. It ensures that the element `arr[i]` is smaller than or equal to the previous element.\n\nLet's explain how this invariant works:\n\n* Initially, `p` is zero, so it's the first element of the array that needs to be sorted.\n* The outer while loop iterates over each element in the array until `p` reaches the end of the array.\n* Inside the outer loop, there's another while loop that compares `arr[i]` with its predecessor (`arr[i-1]`). If `arr[i]` is greater than its predecessor, it swaps them. This continues until we have a valid pair of adjacent elements that are smaller than or equal to each other.\n* After swapping `arr[i]` with its predecessor, `p` is incremented, so the next element is now `arr[i+1]`, which needs to be sorted.\n* The invariant ensures that each element is smaller than or equal to its predecessor, which is a necessary condition for insertion sort to work correctly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm in your code ensures that each element is smaller than or equal to its predecessor, which proves the partial correctness of the algorithm."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = len(arr)\n    while p > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        p -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u7247\u6bb5\u4f3c\u4e4e\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u4f60\u8bd5\u56fe\u5b9e\u73b0\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u4f46\u662f\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u6709\u4e00\u4e9b\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\u3002\n\n\u5728\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u662f\u627e\u5230\u8981\u63d2\u5165\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f3c\u4e4e\u8bd5\u56fe\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u4e0e\u5176\u524d\u4e00\u4e2a\u5143\u7d20\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u627e\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u3002\u4f46\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e76\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u3002\n\n\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u60f3\u662f\u5c06\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u597d\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u65ad\u79fb\u52a8\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u7ec4\u90fd\u88ab\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u5206\u4e3a\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u548c\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e2d\u627e\u5230\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u3002\n\n\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u793a\u4f8b\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        key = arr[i]\n        j = i - 1\n        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:\n            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]\n            j -= 1\n        arr[j + 1] = key\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u5c06\u6570\u7ec4\u5206\u4e3a\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u548c\u672a\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u63d2\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6392\u5e8f\u90e8\u5206\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u6267\u884c\u63d2\u5165\u6392\u5e8f\u3002"}]
