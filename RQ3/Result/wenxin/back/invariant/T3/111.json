If they match, we assign the value of `arr[l]` to `member_value`.\n* After each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1, which means that we move to the next member in the list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n* The loop invariant ensures that each iteration of the loop correctly finds the value of the member at the target ID.\n* The function returns the value of `member_value` after the loop completes, which is the value of the member with the specified ID."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    l = len(arr)\n    while l > 0:\n        l -= 1\n        if l == id:\n            member_value = arr[l]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c0f\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u5728\u5faa\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f60\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86 `l -= 1`\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e4b\u524d\u7684 `while` \u8bed\u53e5\u4e2d\u4f60\u5df2\u7ecf\u5c06\u5176\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a `len(arr)`\u3002\u4f60\u5e94\u8be5\u4fdd\u6301\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u7d22\u5f15\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528 `l += 1`\u3002\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    l = len(arr)\n    while l:  # \u6ce8\u610f\u8fd9\u91cc\uff0cl\u540e\u9762\u6709\u4e00\u4e2a\u9017\u53f7\n        l -= 1\n        if l == id:\n            member_value = arr[l]\n    return member_value\n```\n\u8fd9\u6837\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5c31\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u5730\u8fd4\u56de\u6307\u5b9aID\u7684\u6210\u5458\u7684\u503c\u4e86\u3002"}]
