The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n\n`sum_value_i = give_sum(arr[i])`\n\nExplanation:\n\n* The loop invariant ensures that at each iteration, the sum of the elements of the array up to and including the current index is correct.\n* `sum_value` is initially set to 0, so it starts out with a clean slate.\n* `k` is used as a counter to iterate through the array.\n* In each iteration, the value at index `k` is added to `sum_value`.\n* After each iteration, `k` is incremented by 1, ensuring that the next iteration starts at the next element in the array.\n* When `k` reaches the length of the array, the loop will end and `sum_value` will contain the sum of all the elements in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is `sum_value_i = give_sum(arr[i])`.
