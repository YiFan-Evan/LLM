The goal of selection sort is to find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array, swap it with the first element, move on to the next unsorted part and find the next minimum, and repeat this process until all elements are sorted.\n\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in your code is:\n\n`arr[i] <= arr[i+1] <= ... <= arr[r]`\n\nIn each iteration, the algorithm compares the i-th element with the elements to its right. If it finds a smaller element, it swaps them. This ensures that the i-th element is always the smallest in its current subarray.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe invariant ensures that the algorithm maintains the property of selecting the minimum element in each iteration, which proves the partial correctness of the program."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    r = len(arr)\n    while r > 0:\n        r -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[r]:\n                temp = arr[r]\n                arr[r] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u770b\u8d77\u6765\u4f60\u4fee\u6539\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u4f46\u6211\u4ecd\u7136\u770b\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\uff0c`i`\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u800c\u4e14\uff0c\u4f60\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83`arr[z]`\u548c`arr[r]`\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u540d`i`\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728Python\u4e2d\u662f\u4e0d\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u547d\u540d\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u5728\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u4ea4\u6362\u5143\u7d20\u65f6\u4e0d\u4f1a\u5f15\u8d77\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\n\n\u53e6\u5916\uff0c\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf`temp`\u6765\u4ea4\u6362\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u5e76\u6ca1\u6709\u5b9a\u4e49\u8fd9\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u4f60\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u5b58\u50a8\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6211\u5bf9\u4f60\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6539\u540e\u7684\u7248\u672c\uff1a\n\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    r = len(arr)\n    while r > 0:\n        r -= 1\n        z = r - 1\n        while z >= 0:\n            if arr[z] < arr[r]:\n                temp = arr[r]\n                arr[r] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        if r == 0:  # If the element at position 'r' is now the smallest, it is at its correct position, so move to the next element\n            break\n        r -= 1  # Continue moving towards smaller indices until all elements are sorted\n    return arr\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u73b0\u5728\u5e94\u8be5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6b63\u5e38\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b83\u6309\u7167\u9009\u62e9\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6570\u7ec4\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7248\u672c\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\u5047\u5b9a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u5df2\u7ecf\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5217\u8868\u6216\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6570\u7ec4\u4e2d\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u662f\u6574\u6570\u6216\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u3002"}]
