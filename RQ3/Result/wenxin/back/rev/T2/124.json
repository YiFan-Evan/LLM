However, as you mentioned that you only want to follow the sequence 1->2->3->4, I will use Dijkstra's algorithm in this case to give you an approximate shortest path that follows this sequence.\n\nFirst, let's understand Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n* The algorithm uses a priority queue to keep track of the shortest distance from the start node to all other nodes.\n* The priority queue is sorted by distance in ascending order, so that nodes with the shortest distance are always at the top.\n* When a new node is discovered, its distance is updated to be the shortest distance to all nodes already in the priority queue.\n* If there is a shorter path to a node from another node in the priority queue, the new node will push the other node out of the priority queue.\n\nIn our case, we need to follow the sequence 1->2->3->4. Therefore, we can initialize Dijkstra's algorithm with node 4 as the start node and node 1 as the target node. We will start by considering only nodes directly connected to node 4 and updating their distances based on our sequence.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Define your graph as a dictionary of lists where each inner list represents an edge connecting two nodes\ngraph = {\n    0: [8],\n    1: [2, 4],\n    2: [6],\n    3: [6, 11],\n    4: [0, 1, 5],\n    5: [4, 7],\n    6: [1],\n    7: [5],\n    8: [],\n    9: [],\n    10: [],\n    11: [3],\n    12: [12, 13],\n    13: [],\n    14: [12]\n}\n\n# Initialize Dijkstra's algorithm with start node 4 and target node 1\nstart_node = 4\ntarget_node = 1\ndistances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}  # Initialize distances as infinity for all nodes except start node\ndistances[start_node] = 0  # Set start node distance to 0\nqueue = [(0, start_node)]  # Initialize priority queue with (distance, node) tuples in ascending order\nvisited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n\nwhile queue:\n    current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)  # Pop the smallest distance from the queue and get its node\n    if current_node not in visited:  # If the node is not visited yet, update its distances and add it to the visited set\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:  # Iterate over all neighbors of current node\n            distance = distances[current_node] + graph[current_node][neighbor]  # Calculate the new distance from current node to neighbor\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:  # If this is a shorter path, update the distance and remove any previous shortest path to neighbor from queue\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                priority = (-distance, neighbor)  # Convert distance to a tuple with negative sign for heapq library to handle properly (we need to reverse the tuple after popping)\n                heapq.heappush(queue, priority)  # Add neighbor back to queue after updating its distance and maintaining its original order in queue\n                if neighbor == target_node:  # If we reached the target node, we are done!
