Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph by considering the shortest path to each adjacent node one at a time.\n\nHere's how you can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 22:\n\n1. Create an empty set called shortestDistances, which will store the distances from the start node to each node in the graph. Initially, all distances will be set to infinity, except for the distance from node 3 to itself, which will be set to 0.\n2. Create an empty array called shortestPaths, which will store the shortest path from node 3 to each node in the graph. Initially, all paths will be empty.\n3. Initialize the shortestDistance and shortestPath variables to 0 and an empty array respectively. These variables will keep track of the shortest distance and path to node 22.\n4. Iterate over all nodes in the graph starting from node 3. For each node, update its shortestDistance by considering its distance from node 3 and the shortestDistance of its adjacent nodes.\n5. If the shortestDistance of node 22 is less than or equal to the current shortestDistance, update its shortestPath with the current path to node 3, and reset its shortestDistance to infinity.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until all nodes have been processed.\n\nNow that you have processed all nodes in the graph, you can print the shortestPath variable to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 22.\n\nHere's the Python code that implements Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [19],\n    1: [12],\n    2: [14, 23],\n    3: [2],\n    4: [18],\n    5: [15],\n    6: [22],\n    7: [23],\n    8: [13],\n    9: [17, 15],\n    10: [18, 19],\n    11: [20],\n    12: [],\n    13: [],\n    #
