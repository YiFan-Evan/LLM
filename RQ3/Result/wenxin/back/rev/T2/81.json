Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph-traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph by maintaining a priority queue that prioritizes the shortest distance between nodes.\n\nHere's how we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize the distance array with all nodes set to infinity except for the start node, which is set to zero.\n2. Initialize a set of visited nodes with all nodes.\n3. Initialize a priority queue with start node as the priority and set its distance to zero.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n\t* Extract the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\n\t* Remove it from the visited set.\n\t* For each edge connecting this node to another node:\n\t\t+ If the destination node is not yet visited, update its distance and add it to the visited set.\n5. The final path is the sequence of nodes in the visited set, starting from the start node to the destination node.\n\nHere's the Python code implementation:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Graph represented as an adjacency list\ngraph = {\n    0: [6],\n    1: [11],\n    2: [11, 3],\n    3: [10, 12],\n    4: [2],\n    5: [9],\n    6: [],\n    7: [8],\n    8: [7, 11],\n    9: [],\n    10: [],\n    11: [],\n    12: []\n}\n\nstart_node = 2\ndestination = 3\nvisited = set()  #
