The algorithm uses a priority queue to maintain the shortest distances from the start node to all other nodes. The algorithm iteratively updates the shortest distances for all nodes that are reachable from the current node.\n\nHere's how Dijkstra's algorithm would be applied to the provided graph:\n\n1. Initialize the priority queue with the start node (node 0) and its distance to be 0.\n2. Iterate over the nodes in the priority queue, maintaining a set of visited nodes and a current shortest distance.\n3. For each node in the priority queue, update its shortest distance by considering its neighbors that are not yet visited.\n4. If the shortest distance for a node is smaller than the current shortest distance, update the current shortest distance and the priority queue.\n5. After reaching the end of the priority queue, there will be a single path from start node to target node. The path is represented by a sequence of nodes, starting from the start node to the target node.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to our graph:\n\n1. Initialize priority queue with nodes 0 and 3 (start node and target node). Distance to be 0 for both nodes.\n2. Iterate over nodes in priority queue:\n\n\n\t* Node 0 has neighbors 3 (with distance 0), 6 (with distance 4), and 7 (with distance 6). It will have distance 2 for 3 since there is a shorter path via nodes 4 and 5 (distance = 1 + 1 = 2). It will keep distance 0 for itself (the start node).\n\t* Node 3 has neighbors 6 and 7. It will have distance 2 for both neighbors since there is no shorter path to reach them from it.\n3. After reaching end of priority queue, we have a single path from start node to target node: 0->1->4->5->3.
