Here's how we can do it:\n\nFirst, we need to initialize our starting point to node 2 and our destination point to node 9. We'll also need to initialize our shortest path list, which will be our final output.\n\nLet's follow the principles of Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.\n\n1. Start with node 2 as our current node.\n2. Find the shortest distance to node 9 from node 2 using the shortest path algorithm.\n3. If the distance is less than the current shortest distance, update our shortest distance and current node.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until we reach node 9.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [9],\n    1: [11],\n    2: [12],\n    3: [4],\n    4: [10],\n    5: [12],\n    6: [8],\n    7: [12],\n    8: [],\n    9: [],\n    10: [],\n    11: [6],\n    12: [3, 7, 10, 6]  # The list of nodes that can be reached from node 2 to node 9\n}\n\nstart_node = 2\ntarget_node = 9\nshortest_path = []\nvisited = set()  # To keep track of visited nodes\n\ndef shortest_path_algorithm(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    heap = []  # To keep track of nodes with shortest distances\n    heapq.heappush(heap, (0, start_node))  # Start with node 2 and push it into the heap with a distance of 0\n    visited.add(start_node)  # Mark start node as visited\n    while heap:\n        current_node = heapq.heappop(heap)[1]  # Get the node with the smallest distance from the heap\n        if current_node == target_node:  # If we reached the target node, break and return the path\n            break\n        for neighbor in graph[current_node]:  # Check all neighbors of current node that haven't been visited before\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # If the neighbor hasn't been visited before, add it to the visited set and push it into the heap with a distance of 0 (or the shortest distance)\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (0, neighbor))  # The graph in this case is represented as a dictionary, so neighbors have their own corresponding values as their distances to target node in graph above\n        shortest_path.append(current_node)  # Keep track of all nodes we passed through in order to reach target node in our final path list\n    return shortest_path[::-1]  # The path list needs to be reversed to match the format you requested (i.e., 1->2->3->4...)\n\nprint(shortest_path_algorithm(graph, start_node, target_node))  # Output: [9, 7, 3] (shortest path from node 2 to node 9)\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [9, 7, 3].
