Here's how you can solve this problem:\n\nPrinciple:\n\nDijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph by considering each edge in turn and choosing the path with the smallest cost.\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1: Create a priority queue (e.g., PriorityQueue in Python) with the nodes in the graph.\n\nStep 2: Initially, all nodes have a distance of infinity except for the start node (node 1).\n\nStep 3: Add node 5 to the priority queue with a distance of infinity.\n\nStep 4: While the priority queue is not empty, select the node with the smallest distance and update its neighbors' distances.\n\nStep 5: Keep repeating this process until reaching node 5 or there are no more nodes with an available distance.\n\nCode:\n\nHere's a Python code snippet that implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 in the given graph:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph['nodes']}  # Initialize distances with infinity\n    distances[start_node] = 0  # Distance from start node to itself is zero\n    queue = [(0, start_node)]  # Priority queue with (distance, node) tuples\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    visited.add(start_node)  # Start node is initially visited\n\n    while queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)  # Pop the node with the smallest distance from the queue\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:  # If the current distance is larger than the updated distance, skip it\n            continue\n        for neighbor, edge_weight in graph['edges'][current_node].items():  # Update distances of neighbors of current node\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # Skip visited nodes to avoid unnecessary computations\n                new_distance = distances[current_node] + edge_weight  # Calculate new distance to neighbor node using updated distance of current node and edge weight\n                if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:  # If new distance is smaller than current distance, update it\n                    distances[neighbor] = new_distance\n                    heapq.heappush(queue, (new_distance, neighbor))  # Add neighbor node to the queue with updated distance\n        visited.add(current_node)  # Mark current node as visited after updating its neighbors' distances\n    return distances[target_node]  # Return shortest distance from start node to target node if target node is reached or else return infinity (as we cannot reach it)\n```\nFinally, the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 in the given graph is 4 as this is the shortest distance.
