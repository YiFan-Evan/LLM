Initialize a set of nodes called \"visited\" and initialize its size to the number of nodes in the graph.\n2. Initialize a priority queue with the nodes in the graph. The priority of each node should be its distance from the start node. Initialize all distances to infinity (or some large number).\n3. Remove the start node from the priority queue and add it to the \"visited\" set.\n4. Iterate over the remaining nodes in the priority queue.\n\t* For each node in the queue, update its distance to node 2 based on its shortest distance so far (if it's smaller) or as the current distance (if it's larger).\n\t* If the updated distance is smaller than the current shortest distance, update the shortest distance and remove all nodes that are not on the shortest path from the queue.\n5. After all nodes have been processed, the shortest path is the sequence of nodes that were removed from the queue in order of their distance from node 4 to node 2.\n\nPython code:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, dest):\n    visited = set()\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph['nodes']}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    pq = [(0, start)]  # Priority queue with (distance, node) pairs\n    while pq:\n        (distance, current_node) = heapq.heappop(pq)\n        if current_node == dest:\n            path = []\n            while current_node not in visited:\n                path.append(current_node)\n                current_node = next(node for node in graph['nodes'] if node in visited and graph['edges'][graph['nodes'].index(node)][graph['nodes'].index(current_node)] in path)\n            return path[::-1]  # Reverse the path to get from start to dest in forward order\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        for neighbor in graph['nodes'][current_node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                new_distance = distances[current_node] + 1 if neighbor == dest else min(distances[neighbor], distance + graph['edges'][graph['nodes'].index(current_node)][graph['nodes'].index(neighbor)])\n                if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                    distances[neighbor] = new_distance\n                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_distance, neighbor))\n    raise ValueError(\"No path found\")  # If no path is found, raise an error\n\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 6], [1, 3], [2, 5], [4, 7]]\n}\nstart = 4\ndest = 2\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start, dest))  # Output: [4, 3]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [4, 3].
