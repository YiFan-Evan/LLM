Initialize a set of visited nodes and a distance array to store the distances from the start node to each node. Initially, all distances are set to infinity except for the start node (distance = 0).\n2. Iterate over all nodes in the graph, starting from the start node.\n3. For each node, find the shortest distance to the destination node (node 20) by considering only the nodes that are reachable from it and are not yet visited.\n4. Update the shortest distance for all nodes in the reachable subgraph with the current distance of the node.\n5. If the destination node (node 20) is reached, stop the algorithm and return the shortest path to it.\n6. If there are any remaining nodes that cannot be reached from the start node, the graph does not contain a path from node 8 to node 20, so return \"no path found\".\n\nIn Python, the code would look like this:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(nodes, edges, start_node, target_node):\n    visited = set()  # Set of visited nodes\n    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in nodes}  # Distance array initialized with infinity\n    distances[start_node] = 0  # Distance from start node to itself is 0\n    heap = [(0, start_node)]  # Priority queue for Dijkstra's algorithm\n\n    while heap:\n        (curr_distance, curr_node) = heapq.heappop(heap)  # Pop the smallest distance node from the heap\n\n        # If this node is reached from start node and is not visited, update its distance and add it to visited set\n        if curr_node in nodes and curr_distance < distances[curr_node]:\n            distances[curr_node] = curr_distance\n            visited.add(curr_node)\n            for neighbor in edges[curr_node]:  # Add all reachable neighbors to the heap if they haven't been visited yet\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, (distances[neighbor], neighbor))  # Update the distance and add to heap if needed\n\n        # If destination node is reached, return the shortest path from start node to destination node\n        if curr_node == target_node:\n            path = []\n            while curr_node != start_node:  # Reverse the path to get from start node to destination node\n                path.append(curr_node)\n                curr_node = distances[curr_node]  # Move to next node in the path array\n            path = list(reversed(path))  # Reverse again to get the correct path from start node to destination node\n            return path  # Return the shortest path from start node to destination node\n\n    return \"no path found\"  # If no path is found, return \"no path found\"\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->6->21->20.
