BFS is a search algorithm that explores the graph by starting from a given node and moving to its neighbors before moving to the next level of neighbors.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem:\n\n1. Create an empty queue to store the nodes that we will explore during the BFS.\n2. Create an empty set to store the visited nodes.\n3. Start from node 2 and add it to the queue and the visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t* Extract the first node from the queue (i.e., the current node).\n\t* For each neighbor of the current node that is not yet visited:\n\t\t+ Add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\t* Remove all neighbors of the current node from the queue that have been processed so far (to avoid exploring the same path twice).\n5. At the end, you will have a list of nodes in the shortest path from node 2 to node 5. Each node in this list represents a \"link\" in the path from node 2 to node 5.\n\nIn Python, this would look like:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [10, 13],\n    1: [7],\n    2: [6, 7, 10],\n    3: [4, 10],\n    4: [9],\n    5: [5, 13],\n    6: [13],\n    7: [12, 13],\n    8: [11, 13, 14],\n    9: [],\n    10: [],\n    ...\n}\n\nstart_node = 2\ntarget_node = 5\nvisited = set()  # Set to track visited nodes\nqueue = deque([start_node])  # Queue for BFS\npath = []  # List to store the path\n\ndef bfs(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()  # Extract first node from queue\n        visited.add(node)  # Mark as visited\n        path.append(node)  # Add node to path list\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # For each neighbor of current node...\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # ...that is not yet visited...\n                queue.append(neighbor)  # ...add it to queue and mark as visited\n                visited.add(neighbor)  # ...and mark as visited in visited set too\n                path.append(neighbor)  # Add neighbor to path list too\n                break  # After adding all neighbors of current node, break out of loop\n        else:  # If no neighbors found for current node, break out of loop too (path found)\n            break\n    return path[::-1]  # Return path in reverse order (shortest path is usually at the end)\n```\nRunning this code will return a list of nodes in the shortest path from node 2 to node 5: `[2, 6, 5]`.
