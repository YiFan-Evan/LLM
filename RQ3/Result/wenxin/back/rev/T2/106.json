To do this, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph and find the shortest path.\n\nHere's how we can do it:\n\n1. Create a visited array to keep track of nodes that have been visited during the search. Initially, all nodes are unvisited.\n2. Create a queue to store nodes that need to be visited during the search. Initially, all nodes except the starting node are in the queue.\n3. Start the DFS from node 8 using a recursive function. In each iteration, take the next node from the queue and check if it is equal to node 3. If it is, then we have found the shortest path. If not, then mark the current node as visited and recursively call the function on its adjacent nodes (nodes adjacent to it in the graph).\n\nHere's the code in pseudocode:\n\n\n```python\nfunction dfs(node):\n    if node == target_node:\n        return shortest_path = [node]\n    visited[node] = true  # Mark node as visited\n    for each neighbor of node in graph:\n        if not visited[neighbor]:\n            next_path = dfs(neighbor)  # Recursively call DFS on neighbors\n            if next_path is not None:\n                shortest_path = shortest_path + next_path  # Combine with current path if not same as previous path\n    return shortest_path  # Return shortest path if no next path found\n```\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to our graph:\n\n1. Create a visited array with all nodes unvisited: `visited = [false]*len(nodes)`\n2. Create a queue to store nodes that need to be visited during the search: `queue = []`\n3. Start DFS from node 8: `shortest_path = dfs(8)`\n4. After the DFS completes, the shortest path will be returned as `shortest_path`. It should contain all nodes from node 8 to node 3 in order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [8, 7, 4, 3].
