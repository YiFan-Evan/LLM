BFS is a recursive algorithm that explores the graph by building a queue of nodes and iteratively popping them from the queue and exploring their neighbors.\n\nHere's how you can solve this problem using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty set or list to store the path.\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\n3. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\n4. Set a counter to keep track of the number of steps taken.\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n\t1. Extract the current node from the queue.\n\t2. Add the extracted node to the path.\n\t3. For each neighbor of the extracted node:\n\t\t- If the neighbor is not in the path or has not been visited yet:\n\t\t\t- Add the neighbor to the queue.\n\t\t\t- Increment the counter by 1.\n6. After completing the search, the path will be stored in the path variable.\n\nHere's the Python code for this problem:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [6, 16, 19, 2, 17],\n    1: [8],\n    2: [21, 14],\n    3: [9],\n    4: [18, 9],\n    5: [9],\n    6: [],\n    7: [],\n    8: [18, 18],\n    9: [15, 16],\n    10: [14],\n    # ... and so on for other nodes in the graph\n}\nstart_node = 18\ntarget_node = 7\npath = []  # Store the path in this list\nqueue = []  # Use a queue for BFS\nvisited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n\ndef bfs(node):\n    global path  # Important!
