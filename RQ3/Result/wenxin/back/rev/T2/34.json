Here's how we can do it:\n\nPrinciple:\n\nThe shortest path problem is typically solved using a technique called Dijkstra's algorithm, which finds the shortest path from a given source node to all other nodes in the graph. It's an optimal solution method, meaning it always finds the shortest path, but it's not necessarily the most efficient way to travel all the way to every destination node.\n\nSolution:\n\nHere's how you can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to solve this problem:\n\nStep 1: Define a queue data structure. You can use Python's queue module to implement it.\n\nStep 2: Create an empty set (or list) called shortestDistances, which will keep track of the distances from node 5 to all other nodes. Initially, set all distances to infinity.\n\nStep 3: Initialize the queue with node 5 and set its distance to 0. Also initialize the distance from node 5 to node 4 as infinity.\n\nStep 4: Iterate over the queue until it's empty. In each iteration, take the node with the smallest distance from the queue and update the distances of its neighbors. If a neighbor's distance becomes smaller than the shortest distance so far, update it in the shortestDistances set.\n\nStep 5: After all nodes have been processed, the shortestDistance of node 4 will be the distance from node 5 to node 4.\n\nCode:\n\nHere's an example implementation in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport queue\n\n# Define the graph as a dictionary of lists\ngraph = {i: [] for i in range(8)}  #
