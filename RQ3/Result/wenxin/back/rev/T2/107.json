Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given starting node and explores all the adjacent nodes in the graph before moving to the next level of nodes.\n2. Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph by following the edges in a depth-first manner.
