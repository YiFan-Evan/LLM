It works by maintaining a set of priority queue, which contains nodes that have a lower cost to reach the target node.\n* It maintains a distance (or cost) for each node in the graph. Initially, all nodes have a distance of infinity. As it traverses the graph, it updates the distance of nodes that are reachable from the current node.\n* When a shorter distance is found for a node, it moves to that node from the priority queue and repeats the process. This continues until it reaches the target node.\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1: Create a set of nodes that are reachable from node 21. This set will be used to initialize the priority queue.\n\nStep 2: Initialize the distance of all nodes to infinity except for node 18, which has a distance of 0.\n\nStep 3: Initialize the priority queue with nodes from the reachable set, with their distances from node 21. The priority queue should be sorted by distance, with the node with the shortest distance at the top.\n\nStep 4: Traverse the priority queue until it reaches the target node (node 18). During each iteration, remove the node from the queue and update its distance if necessary.\n\nStep 5: Return the shortest path from node 21 to node 18.\n\nCode in Python:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Initialize the graph and start node\ngraph = {i: [] for i in range(25)}  #
