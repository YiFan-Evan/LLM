This is a fundamental algorithm used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem:\n\n1. **Create a queue** - We will use a queue to store the nodes that we need to visit to reach our destination node.\n2. **Add the starting node to the queue** - We will add node 7 to the queue.\n3. **Iterate through the edges of the graph** - For each edge, we will:\n\t* Check if the target node (11) is in the queue\n\t* If it is not, add the target node to the queue\n\t* If it is already in the queue, we have found a shorter path and can stop\n4. **Traverse the shortest path** - Once we have reached our target node, we will remove it from the queue and continue to traverse through the remaining nodes in the queue until we reach our starting node (7).\n\nHere's the Python code for this problem:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# The graph represented as an adjacency list\ngraph = {\n    0: [7],\n    7: [8],\n    8: [9],\n    9: [10],\n    10: [11],\n    # Other nodes...\n}\n\n# The start node and destination node\nstart_node = 7\ntarget_node = 11\n\n# Create a queue to store nodes\nqueue = deque([start_node])\n\nwhile queue:\n    current_node = queue.popleft()  # Pop from the queue to get the next node to process\n    for neighbor in graph[current_node]:  # Iterate through each neighbor of the current node\n        if neighbor == target_node:  # Check if we reached our target node (queue should now be empty)\n            print(\"The shortest path is:\", current_node)  # Print the path found from the start node to the target node\n            break  # Stop checking remaining nodes in the queue and return with our found path\n    if len(queue) == 0:  # If there are no more nodes to process in the queue, keep checking other nodes for shorter paths (the path is already found)\n        continue\n    queue.append(neighbor)  # If not, add this neighbor to the queue and continue processing next ones (next iteration)\n```\nWhen you run this code, it will print out the shortest path from node 7 to node 11.
