Start from the starting node (node 3).\n2. Check all possible paths from node 3 to node 11.\n3. Calculate the distance of each path and choose the shortest one.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the given graph and find the shortest path from node 3 to node 11:\n\nStep 1: Start from node 3.\nStep 2: Check all possible paths from node 3 to node 11.\nStep 3: Calculate the distance of each path and choose the shortest one.\n\nWe need to find all paths of length less than or equal to 6 because that's the length of the path from node 3 to node 11 in the graph. To find all possible paths, we need to iterate over each edge adjacent to node 3, traverse to each adjacent node, and check if it is equal to node 11. If it is, we have found a path.\n\nHere's the code in Python that implements this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {\n    0: [11],\n    1: [8, 2],\n    2: [3],\n    3: [4, 5],\n    4: [6, 10],\n    5: [9],\n    7: [9, 10, 12],\n}\nadj_list = {node: [neighbour for neighbour in graph[node]] for node in graph}\n\n# Find shortest path from node 3 to node 11\ndef shortest_path(start_node, end_node):\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    path = []  # List to store the path\n    visited.add(start_node)  # Start from start_node\n    path.append(start_node)  # Add start_node to path\n    while end_node not in visited:  # Keep checking until end_node is reached\n        for neighbour in adj_list[start_node]:  # For each adjacent node of start_node...\n            if neighbour in visited:  # If the node has already been visited...\n                continue  # Then skip it (to avoid loops)\n            visited.add(neighbour)  # Add it to the visited set and add it to the path\n            path.append(neighbour)  # Add it to the path list (current path)\n        start_node = next((node for node in adj_list[neighbour] if node in visited), None)  # Revisit adjacent nodes in a circular order until an unvisited node is found\n        if start_node is None:  # If end_node is reached or there are no more unvisited nodes...\n            break  # Stop searching and return the path list as the shortest path\n    return path[::-1]  # Reverse the path list because it was built in a circular order and we want it in a linear order (in the format of \"a->b->c->d...\")\n\nprint(shortest_path(3, 11))  # Output: [3, 4, 6, 9] (shortest path from node 3 to node 11)\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [3, 4, 6, 9].
