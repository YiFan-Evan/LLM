Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given node and explores all the adjacent nodes in a breadth-first manner until it reaches the target node.\n2. Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is similar to BFS, but it uses a priority queue to efficiently find the shortest path between two nodes. It is more suitable for large graphs with many nodes and edges.\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing BFS algorithm, we can find the shortest path from node 5 to node 6 as follows:\n\n1. Start from node 5 and add it to the current queue of visited nodes.\n2. Remove node 5 from the queue and add its adjacent nodes (6) to the queue.\n3.
