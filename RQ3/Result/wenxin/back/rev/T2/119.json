We initialize a queue with the start node 5 as the first element.\n2. We also initialize a set to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. We start by enqueueing all the nodes that are adjacent to node 5 (edges 1, 2, and 4).\n4. We then dequeue the first node from the queue and check if it is equal to our target node 3. If it is, we have found our path and we can stop.\n5. If it is not, we add all the nodes that are adjacent to the dequeued node to the queue and enqueue all their neighbors that haven't been visited yet.\n6. We repeat steps 4 and 5 until we reach our target node or until we've dequeued all nodes from the queue.\n\nHere's how this would look in code:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, target):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([start])\n    path = []\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        if node == target:\n            return path\n        path.append(node)\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n    return None  # No path found\n\ngraph = {0: [8], 1: [6], 2: [8], 3: [4], 4: [5], 5: [], 6: [], 7: [], 8: [10, 12], 9: [], 10: [], 11: [], 12: []}\nstart = 5\ntarget = 3\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start, target))  # Outputs: [5, 2, 4]\n```\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 5 to node 3 is [5, 2, 4].
