Create an empty set to store the nodes visited. Initially, all nodes will be unvisited.\n2. Iterate through all nodes in the graph. For each node, initialize its distance to infinity and set it as the start node.\n3. Iterate through all nodes in the graph that are reachable from the current node. If the distance of any of these nodes is less than the current distance, update its distance and the shortest path.\n4.
