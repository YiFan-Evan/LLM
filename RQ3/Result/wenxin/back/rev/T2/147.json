BFS is a search algorithm that explores the graph by first considering all nodes that are reachable from the starting node, and then considering their neighbors, and so on.\n\nHere's how you can solve this problem using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue for BFS.\n2. Start from node 3 and add it to the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Iterate through the queue, and for each node in the queue:\n\t* Remove the node from the queue.\n\t* Check if the node is already in the visited set, if it is, then we've reached our destination and we can stop the search.\n\t* Otherwise, add all adjacent nodes to the visited set and add them to the queue.\n5. After all nodes have been processed, the shortest path is the sequence of nodes in the queue that we followed to reach our destination node (in this case, it will be 3->7->12->13).\n\nIn Python, here's an implementation of this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [5, 11, 4, 7],\n    1: [8],\n    2: [9],\n    3: [9, 12],\n    4: [10],\n    5: [],\n    6: [12, 14],\n    7: [9, 12],\n    8: [],\n    9: [2, 6],\n    10: [13],\n    11: [],\n    12: [6, 7, 13],\n    13: [],\n}\n\nstart_node = 3\ndestination = 13\nvisited = set()  #
