Start with node 10 as the current node.\n2. Find the shortest distance to all neighboring nodes of node 10.\n3. If the shortest distance to a neighboring node is less than the current distance to that node, update the current node and distance to that neighboring node.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until reaching node 11.\n\nSolution:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->2->11\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Start with node 10 as the current node. The distance to node 10 is initially set to 0.\n2. The shortest distance to neighboring nodes is found as follows:\n\n\n\t* Node 4 has a distance of 1 from node 10 (since it is connected directly).\n\t* Nodes 7 and 8 have a distance of 2 from node 10 (since they are connected to node 2, which is connected to node 10).\n\t* Nodes 2, 3, and 6 have a distance of infinity (since they are not directly connected to node 10).\n3. The shortest distance from node 2 to node 11 is now found: it is also infinity since there is no direct connection between these nodes. However, there is a path of length 3 from node 2 to node 7 and then to node 11 (since nodes 7 and 8 are also connected directly). Therefore, the shortest path from node 10 to node 11 is:\n\n\n```arduino\n10->2->7->11\n```\n4.
