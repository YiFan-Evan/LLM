Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given node and explores all the adjacent nodes in a given depth before moving to the next level of nodes.\n2. Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is another method for finding shortest paths in a graph. It is similar to BFS, but it uses a priority queue to keep track of the shortest distance to each node and thus can potentially find a shorter path.\n\nHere's how you can apply BFS algorithm to find the shortest path:\n\nAlgorithm:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the starting node as current_node = 6, and initialize a visited array of boolean values for each node indicating whether it has been visited or not. Initially, all nodes are unvisited.\n\nStep 2: Initialize a queue for BFS, and add the starting node to the queue.\n\nStep 3: While the queue is not empty:\n\na. Extract the first node from the queue (i.e., current_node)\n\nb. If the current_node is equal to the target node (i.e., node 0), then we have found our path, so exit the loop.\n\nc. For each adjacent node of the current_node:\n\ni. If the adjacent node is not visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue (this step ensures that we only follow nodes that are on the shortest path).\n\nd. Update the distance to each adjacent node of the current_node based on its shortest distance so far (i.e., if there are multiple paths with the same distance, we can choose any one of them).\n\nStep 4: Return the shortest path from node 6 to node 0 as a list of nodes in the format \"1->2->3->4\".\n\nCode implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, target):\n    current_node = start\n    visited = set()  # To mark nodes as visited\n    queue = deque([current_node])  # Initialize queue with starting node\n    distance = {current_node: float('inf')}  # Initialize distance array for each node, with infinity initially (as it will be updated later)\n    visited.add(current_node)  # Initially, all nodes are unvisited and marked as visited in distance array (but this doesn't matter because it will be overwritten by our logic)\n    path = []  # Initialize path for storing nodes on shortest path\n    while queue:\n        size = len(queue)  # Number of nodes left in queue\n        for _ in range(size):  # Iterate through each adjacent node of current_node in steps of size * num_edges in order to visit all edges for BFS algorithm (number of edges here is included in num_edges)\n            current_adjacent = queue.popleft()  # Extract an adjacent node from queue\n            if current_adjacent not in visited:  # If adjacent node is not visited, add it to queue and mark it as visited\n                queue.append(current_adjacent)\n                visited.add(current_adjacent)\n            if current_adjacent == target:  # If adjacent node is target, we have found our path, so exit the loop and return it\n                break\n            path.append(current_adjacent)  # Add adjacent node to path if it is not already there (i.e., if it is not part of shortest path yet)\n            distance[current_adjacent] = distance[current_node] + 1  # Update distance array with new shortest distance for adjacent node (i.e., shortest distance from current_node to current_adjacent)\n    return path[::-1]  # Reverse path array to get \"1->2->3->4\" format instead of \"4->3->2->1\" format (this is because Python arrays are 0-indexed)\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [6, 5, 4].
