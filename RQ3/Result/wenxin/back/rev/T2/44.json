BFS explores all the adjacent nodes in a queue, checking each node to see if it's closer to the destination than the node it was in queue with. It repeats this process until it reaches the destination or runs out of nodes to explore.\n\nHere's how we can use BFS to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 3:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store the nodes we want to explore: `queue = []`\n2. Add the starting node (node 6) to the queue: `queue.append(6)`\n3. Set a variable to keep track of the distance to the destination: `distance = float('inf')`\n4. Set a variable to keep track of the current node: `current_node = 6`\n5. While the queue is not empty:\n\t* Remove the first node from the queue: `node = queue.pop(0)`\n\t* If this node is the destination (node 3), then we've found our path and can stop: `if node == 3: break`\n\t* Otherwise, check if this node has a closer distance to the destination than the current distance: `if distance > get_distance(node, target_node): distance = get_distance(node, target_node); current_node = node`\n\t* If this node has no closer distance, add its neighbors to the queue: `for neighbor in get_neighbors(node): queue.append(neighbor)`\n6. After exploring all nodes, return the final path: `path = []` while current_node != 3: path.append(current_node) current_node = next(iter(path))\n\nHere's the code for the helper functions:\n\n* `get_distance(node, target_node)` - return the distance from the start node to a specific node (if possible). It returns `float('inf')` if it cannot reach that node directly from the start node.\n* `get_neighbors(node)` - return a list of adjacent nodes for a given node.\n\nThe code for these helper functions would depend on how your graph is represented in your specific problem. For example, if your graph is represented as an adjacency matrix, you might have something like this:\n\n\n```python\ndef get_distance(node, target_node):\n    return get_adjacency_matrix()[node][target_node]\n\ndef get_neighbors(node):\n    return get_adjacency_matrix()[node] - [node]\n```\nHere's how you can implement these helper functions for your specific graph:\n\n\n```python\ndef get_distance(node, target):\n    return abs(target - node) if target in nodes else float('inf')\n\ndef get_neighbors(node):\n    return edges[nodes.index(node)] - [node]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: {0: {'to': '1', 'length': 1}, '1': {'to': '2', 'length': 1}, '2': {'to': '4', 'length': 1}, '4': {'to': '3', 'length': 2}, '7': {'to': None, 'length': float('inf')}}\nThis dictionary shows that there are three paths from node 6 to node 3, and each path has a different length (the length of path 4 is shown as infinity because it doesn't exist directly from node 6).
