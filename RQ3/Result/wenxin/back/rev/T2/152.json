BFS is a search algorithm that explores the graph by first considering all nodes that are reachable from the starting node in a single step, then considering all nodes that are reachable from these nodes in a single step, and so on.\n\nHere's how we can find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty queue to store the nodes that we will consider for expansion.\n2. Add node 11 to the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to store the visited nodes.\n4. Iterate through the queue while it is not empty:\n\t* Remove the first node from the queue (this is our current node).\n\t* If the current node is equal to our destination node (node 3), then we have found our path.\n\t* Otherwise, go through each of the edges that are adjacent to the current node (i.e., start from node 11, follow edges to reach adjacent nodes, and add them to the queue).\n\t\t+ Add these adjacent nodes to the visited set so that we do not explore these nodes again.\n5. Return the list of nodes in the shortest path found.\n\nHere's the Python code for this problem:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, dest):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([start])\n    path = []\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        if node == dest:\n            return path[::-1]  # Reverse the path to get the shortest path\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n                path.append(neighbor)\n    return None  # If no path found, return None\n\ngraph = {0: [2], 1: [6], 2: [12], 3: [4], 4: [12], 5: [11], 7: [8], 8: [9], 9: [10], 10: [13], 11: [3], 12: [], 13: [], 14: []}\nstart = 11\ndest = 3\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start, dest))  # Output: [3]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [3].
