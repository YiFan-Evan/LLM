Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given node and explores all the adjacent nodes in a breadth-first manner until it reaches the target node.\n2. Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is another commonly used method for finding shortest paths in a graph. It works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes, where the priority of each node is its distance from the starting point. The algorithm then iteratively removes the node with the minimum distance from the queue and updates the distances of its adjacent nodes based on their shortest possible paths to the removed node.\n\nSolution:\n\nAlgorithm: Breadth-first search\n\n1.
