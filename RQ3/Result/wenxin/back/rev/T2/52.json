BFS is a technique that explores all the nodes in a graph before reaching the target node.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem:\n\n1. Create a queue (or use an existing data structure like a BFS stack) to store the nodes that we need to explore. Initially, node 1 should be added to the queue.\n2. Iterate through the queue while it is not empty.\n3. In each iteration, remove the first node from the queue and add its neighbors to the queue if they are not already in the queue.\n4.
