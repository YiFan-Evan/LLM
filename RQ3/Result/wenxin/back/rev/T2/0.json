Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given starting node and explores all the adjacent nodes in the graph before moving to the next level of nodes.\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1: Create a queue for BFS algorithm.\nStep 2: Add the starting node (node 2) to the queue.\nStep 3: Iterate through the edges of the graph and follow them one by one.\nStep 4: For each edge, remove the start node from the queue and add the end node (node 1) to the queue if it is not already in the queue.\nStep 5: Repeat step 3 until all nodes in the graph have been visited or the shortest path has been found.\nStep 6: Once all nodes have been visited or the shortest path has been found, return the path from node 2 to node 1.\n\nAlgorithm implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    queue = deque([start_node])  # Create a queue for BFS algorithm\n    path = []  # List to store the path from start_node to target_node\n\n    while queue:\n        current_node = queue.popleft()  # Pop the first node from the queue\n        visited.add(current_node)  # Mark the node as visited\n        if current_node == target_node:  # If we reached the target node, return the path\n            return path\n        for next_node in graph[current_node]:  # Explore all adjacent nodes of current_node\n            if next_node not in visited:  # If next_node is not visited yet, add it to queue and path\n                queue.append(next_node)\n                path.append(next_node)\n    return None  # If no path was found, return None\n```\nIn this example, shortest_path is called with graph, start_node (2) and target_node (1).
