BFS is a method of finding the shortest path in a graph by exploring nodes one at a time in a pre-determined order.\n\nHere's how we can implement it:\n\n1. Create an empty queue Q and an empty set visited nodes visited_nodes = set()\n2. Initialize Q with the starting node: Q.enqueue(23)\n3. Start from node 23, perform a BFS and keep track of the nodes you visited during each step\n4. While Q is not empty:\n\t- Dequeue a node u\n\t- For each node v in Q:\n\t\t- If there is an edge from u to v:\n\t\t\t- If v is not in visited_nodes:\n\t\t\t\t- Add v to visited_nodes\n\t\t\t\t- If v is not in Q:\n\t\t\t\t\t- Add v to Q\n5. The final path will be a list of nodes that you dequeued from Q during the BFS process.\n\nHere's the Python code for it:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    \"nodes\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    \"edges\": [[0, 7], [0, 24], [1, 4], [2, 16], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 15], [3, 19], [4, 6], [5, 18], [6, 21], [7, 13], [8, 20], [8, 14], [9, 23], [10, 23], [10, 13], [11, 12], [11, 23], [14, 23], [17, 18], [18, 22], [19, None], [20, None], [23, None]]\n}\nstart_node = 23\ntarget_node = None  # specify target node here\n\ndef shortest_path(graph):\n    visited_nodes = set()\n    queue = deque([start_node])\n    path = []\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        visited_nodes.add(node)\n        if node == target_node:\n            return path + [node]  # return the path if target node was reached\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited_nodes:\n                if neighbor not in queue:\n                    queue.append(neighbor)  # enqueue neighbors if they haven't been visited yet\n                else:  # also check if there are any new paths that could be found by enqueueing neighbors multiple times\n                    new_paths = shortest_path(graph)  # recursive call to find new paths that might be found by enqueueing neighbors multiple times\n                    for new_path in new_paths:  # append new paths to path found so far if they are not already included in the path list (or if they are different)\n                        if new_path not in path:  # include new paths only if they are not already included or are different paths\n                            path.append(new_path)\n    return None  # if target node was not reached after exhausting all possible paths in the graph return None or an error message or an empty list indicating no path found.\n    return path  # return the path if target node was reached and there is only one path found in the graph.\n    return []  # return an empty list indicating no path found if target node was reached but there are multiple possible paths in the graph.\n\nprint(shortest_path(graph))  # run the function and print the shortest path found.
