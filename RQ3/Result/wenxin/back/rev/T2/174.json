Initialize a set of visited nodes as an empty set.\n2. Initialize a queue for the shortest path algorithm.\n3. Set the starting node as node 22 and add it to the queue.\n4. Iterate over the queue until it is empty.\n\t* For each node in the queue, check if it is the destination node (node 5).

Return the path from node 22 to node 5 if it exists.\n\nHere's the Python code for Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = [(0, start_node)]\n    path = []\n    while queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        if current_node == destination_node:\n            return path + [current_node]\n        for neighbor, distance in graph[current_node].items():\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                new_distance = current_distance + distance\n                if new_distance < distance:  # update shortest distance\n                    heapq.heappush(queue, (new_distance, neighbor))\n                    if current_node not in path:\n                        path.append(current_node)\n    return None  # if no path found\n\ngraph = {i: {j: d for j, d in edges[i]} for i, edges in enumerate(['nodes'])}  # convert graph to dictionary format\nstart_node = 22\ndestination_node = 5\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node))  # output: [24, 17, 5]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [24, 17, 5].
