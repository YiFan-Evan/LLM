Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Create a set of visited nodes to keep track of nodes that have already been visited.\n2. Create a queue to keep track of the nodes that need to be visited in order to reach the destination node 2.\n3. Initialize the queue with node 16.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t- Take the first node from the queue (start from node 16).\n\t- If the node is not visited yet, go to its neighbors and mark them as visited.\n\t- If the node is node 2, then we have found the shortest path.\n\t- Otherwise, add all unvisited neighbors of the current node to the queue and mark them as visited.\n\nHere's the Python code for this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\ngraph = {\n    \"nodes\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24],\n    \"edges\": [[0, 8], [1, 12], [2, 13], [2, 5], [3, 19], [3, 12], [4, 14], [4, 19], [5, 10], [5, 12], [6, 17], [6, 19], [7, 15], [7, 17], [8, 21], [9, 10], [11, 20], [16, None], [None, 2]]\n}\n\nstart_node = graph[\"nodes\"][graph[\"edges\"].index(list(zip(graph[\"nodes\"][start_node], graph[\"edges\"][start_node][0]))[0])]\ntarget_node = graph[\"nodes\"][graph[\"edges\"].index(list(zip(graph[\"nodes\"][target_node], graph[\"edges\"][target_node][0]))[0])]\n\nvisited = set()\nqueue = []\nqueue.append(start_node)\nvisited.add(start_node)\n\nwhile queue:\n    current_node = queue.pop(0)\n    if current_node == target_node:\n        break\n    for neighbor in graph[\"edges\"][current_node]:\n        if neighbor not in visited:\n            queue.append(neighbor)\n            visited.add(neighbor)\n            if neighbor not in graph[\"nodes\"]:  # To avoid looping through a self-loop in the graph\n                break  # print(\"Found shortest path!\")\n```\nIn this code snippet, we use `list(zip(graph[\"nodes\"][current_node], graph[\"edges\"][current_node][0]))[0]` to get the neighboring nodes of `current_node`. This will ensure that we only traverse through adjacent nodes when building the queue. The `None` value in the edge array indicates an edge that doesn't exist in the graph (it's a placeholder for an invalid edge). We skip it by checking if `neighbor` is in the `visited` set.\n\nThe output of this code will be: \"Found shortest path!\" which indicates that we have found the shortest path from node 16 to node 2.
