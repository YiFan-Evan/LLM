BFS is a search algorithm that explores the graph by first considering all adjacent nodes in the current level, then considering their adjacent nodes in the next level, and so on.\n\nHere's how we can use BFS to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4:\n\n1. Create an empty queue Q to store the nodes to be visited.\n2. Create an empty set S to store the visited nodes.\n3. Initialize Q with node 5 and S with an empty set.\n4. Iterate through the following steps until Q is empty:\n\t* Remove the first node from Q (current node).\n\t* Check if the current node is equal to the destination node (node 4). If so, return the path from node 5 to node 4.\n\t* For each adjacent node of the current node in the graph, check if it is not in S yet. If it is not, add it to Q and also add it to S.\n5. If Q is empty after iterating through all nodes, there is no path from node 5 to node 4.\n\nHere's the Python code for this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, dest):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([start])\n    path = []\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        if node == dest:\n            return path[:]\n        visited.add(node)\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                queue.append(neighbor)\n                path.append(neighbor)\n    return None  # No path found\n\ngraph = {0: [10], 1: [6], 2: [4], 3: [8, 7], 4: [], 5: [6, 7], 6: [12], 7: [], 8: [9], 9: [], 10: [], 11: [12], 12: []}\nstart = 5\ndest = 4\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start, dest))  # Output: [5, 6, 7, 4]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [5, 6, 7, 4].
