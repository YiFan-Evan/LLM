BFS is a method of finding the shortest path in a graph by first visiting all the nodes in the same level and then moving to the next level, checking if any of the nodes in the next level can be reached from the current level.\n\nHere's how you can solve this problem using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Initialize Q with node 13 as the starting node.\n3. Initialize a visited array with all elements as False.\n4. Iterate through Q while it's not empty:\n\t* Remove the first node from Q.\n\t* Set the visited array of this node to True.\n\t* Iterate through the edges of this node:\n\t\t+ If the destination of the edge is not yet visited, add it to Q and mark it as visited.\n5. After completing the above steps, Q should contain only the shortest path from node 13 to node 6.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to our graph:\n\n1. Initialize Q with node 13 as the starting node.\n\n\n```css\nQ = [13]\n```\n2. Initialize visited array with all elements as False.\n\n\n```scss\nvisited = [False]*len(nodes)\n```\n3. Iterate through Q while it's not empty:\n\n\n\t* Remove the first node from Q and set its visited array to True.\n\t* Iterate through edges of this node:\n\t\t+ Destination of edge is node 6, which is not yet visited, so add it to Q and mark it as visited.\n\nAfter completing these steps, Q should contain [6].
