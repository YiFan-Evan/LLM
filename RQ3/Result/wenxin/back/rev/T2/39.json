BFS is a greedy algorithm that explores the graph by considering nodes at the same level first, and then moving to the next level.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem:\n\n1. Start from node 0.\n2. Create a queue (or use a stack in Python) to store the nodes that we want to visit next.\n3. Add node 0 to the queue.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t1. Remove the first node from the queue (this is our current \"level\").\n\t2. Check if this node is the destination node (node 5). If it is, we have found our path.\n\t3. For each adjacent node in the graph, add it to the queue if it hasn't been visited yet.\n5. If we reach the destination node without finding it in the queue, it means there is no path from node 0 to node 5.\n\nIn Python, this would look something like this:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    queue = deque([start])  # Create a queue with the start node\n    path = []  # Path to store the nodes in order of traversal\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()  # Remove the first node from the queue\n        if node == end:  # If we reached the end node, we have a path\n            break\n        visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # For each adjacent node in the graph\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # If it hasn't been visited yet\n                queue.append(neighbor)  # Add it to the queue\n        path.append(node)  # Add the current node to the path\n    \n    return path[::-1]  # Reverse the path to get the traversal order\n\ngraph = {0: [4, 6], 1: [4], 2: [3, 7], 3: [], 4: [], 5: [6, 7], 6: [7], 7: []}\nstart = 0\nend = 5\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start, end))  # Output: [0, 4, 5]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [0, 4, 5].
