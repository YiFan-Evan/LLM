We start by considering the node 5 as our starting point.\n2. We initialize a queue, and add node 5 to it.\n3. We initialize a set (or a list) to keep track of visited nodes. Initially, it contains only node 5.\n4. We keep looping until all nodes in the graph have been visited or until the queue is empty.\n5.

If this node is not the destination node, we add its neighbors to the queue (if they are not already there) and mark them as visited.\n8.
