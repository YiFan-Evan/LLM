Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given starting node and explores all possible paths until it reaches the target node.\n2. Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is similar to BFS, but it uses a priority queue to find the shortest path between two nodes. It is more efficient than BFS when the graph is large and has many nodes.\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing BFS algorithm, we can find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 as follows:\n\n1. Start from node 1 and mark it as visited.\n2. Create a queue and add node 1 to it.\n3. Iterate through the queue until it is empty or all nodes are visited:\n\t* Remove the first node from the queue (node 1).\n\t* Check if there are any edges connecting this node to other nodes in the graph.\n\t\t+ If there are edges, mark the adjacent nodes as visited and add them to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\n\t\t+ If there are no edges, continue to the next node in the queue.\n4.
