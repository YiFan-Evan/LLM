Since node 14 has a distance of 0 from the start node, it is initially extracted from the priority queue and marked as visited.\n* Then, for each of its adjacent nodes (node 21), we check if adding it to the current path (i.e., going from node 14 to node 21) would result in a shorter path to the destination node (node 17). Node 21 has a distance of 2 from the start node, so it is not included in the current path because it is not a shorter path to reach node 17.\n* Finally, when reaching the target node (node 17), we stop traversing the graph and return the resulting path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 14->21->17."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 18], [0, 17], [1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 9], [4, 11], [4, 21], [5, 7], [5, 24], [6, 17], [8, 16], [10, 16], [10, 20], [12, 22], [13, 21], [14, 22], [14, 19], [14, 21], [15, 22], [17, 23], [19, 20], [20, 23], [21, 24]]} The start node: 17 The destination: 14"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 17 to node 14 in the given graph, we can use a graph traversal algorithm such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm.\n\nHere's how we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path:\n\n1.
