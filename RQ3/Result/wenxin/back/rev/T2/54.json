This stack ensures that we do not revisit nodes that have already been explored.\n* For each node in the graph, we keep track of the number of hops needed to reach it.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n1. Initialize visited set and count of hops to 0 for all nodes in the graph.\n2. Push node 6 onto the stack.\n3. Move to step 4 when stack is empty and the current node is node 2.\n4. Perform a DFS from node 2 to find the shortest path.\n\nSteps for DFS:\n\n1. Check if the current node is target node 2. If yes, return the path from node 6 to node 2.\n2. Check if the current node is in the visited set. If yes, move to next node in the stack. If no, continue with next step.\n3. Add the current node to the visited set and increment the count of hops for this node.\n4. For each adjacent node in the graph, if it is not yet visited, pop it from the stack and repeat steps 1-3 above until target node is reached or all nodes are visited.\n5.

Initialize distance to infinity for all nodes and set the distance to 0 for node 2 and node 6.\n2. Add node 2 to the priority queue with distance 0.\n3. Iterate over the priority queue and update the distance of all nodes based on their shortest distance to node 6.\n4. If the distance of node 6 is smaller than the current distance of other nodes, remove all nodes with a larger distance from the priority queue and add node 6 with the updated distance.\n5. Repeat step 3-4 until all nodes are processed or the priority queue is empty.\n\nSteps for Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Distance = infinity for all nodes except nodes in the priority queue, where distance = 0. For node 6, distance = infinity, since it is not yet in the priority queue.\n2. Push node 2 into the priority queue with distance = 0.\n3. Pop the node with smallest distance from the priority queue (which is node 2 in this case). The next step depends on which adjacent node was adjacent to node 2, but has a smaller distance. For example, we know that there are edges (0,5) and (0,6). If we pop a node from the priority queue that is connected to node 2 through (0,5), we know that this node has a smaller distance than any other node connected to node 2 through (0,6). Therefore, we update the distance of this adjacent node to be smaller than any other adjacent node connected to node 2 through (0,6).\n4. Repeat step 3 until all nodes are processed or the priority queue is empty. In this case, it means that there is no shorter path from node 2 to any other node except node 6, so the shortest path is found by adding nodes in order of traversal (i.e., from 2 -> 6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 2 to node 6 is: 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6."}]
