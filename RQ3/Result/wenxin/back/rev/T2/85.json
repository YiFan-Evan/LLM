Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It repeatedly adds the node with the shortest distance to the target node to the path and updates the distances of all neighboring nodes.\n\nHere's how we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 7 to node 2:\n\n1. Initialize an empty set called `visited` to store nodes that have been visited during the search.\n2. Initialize a dictionary called `distances` to store the distances from the starting node to each node in the graph. Initialize it with a default value of infinity for all nodes except for the starting node, which is set to zero.\n3. Initialize a variable `shortest_path` to None to represent the shortest path so far.\n4. Set the distance of the starting node to 0 and add it to the `distances` dictionary.\n5. Set the distance of node 2 to infinity and add it to the `visited` set.\n6. Iterate over all nodes in the `visited` set and find the shortest distance to node 2. For each node, calculate the distance from it to node 2 by subtracting the distance of its adjacent nodes from its distance in the `distances` dictionary. If this new distance is less than or equal to the current shortest distance, update `shortest_path` and the `distances` dictionary for this node and all its adjacent nodes.\n7. The final shortest path will be in the form \"node_id -> node_id -> node_id\". In this case, it will be \"7 -> 8 -> 2\".\n\nHere's the Python code that implements this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [9],\n    1: [6, 8],\n    2: [4],\n    3: [8],\n    4: [7],\n    5: [12],\n    6: [],\n    7: [],\n    8: [9],\n    9: [],\n    10: [11],\n    11: [],\n    12: []\n}\nnodes = graph['nodes']\nedges = graph['edges']\nstart_node = 7\ndestination = 2\n\nvisited = set()\ndistances = {node: float('infinity') for node in nodes}  #
