First, we initialize a set of visited nodes and a set of shortest paths. Initially, all nodes are unvisited and the shortest path is set to infinity.\n2. We start from node 0 and add it to the visited nodes set.\n3. Then, we find the shortest distance to node 4 from node 0 using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n4. To do this, we iterate through all nodes in the graph and compare the distance from node 0 to the current node with the current shortest path. If the distance is less, we update the shortest path.\n5. After finding the shortest path from node 0 to node 4, we continue iterating through the graph until we reach node 4.\n6.
