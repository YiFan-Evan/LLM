Initialize a distance array to store the distances from each node to the target node (here, we initialize it with a very large number, like 99999, as an approximation of infinity).\n2. Initialize a visited array to keep track of which nodes have already been visited. Initially, all nodes are unvisited.\n3. Iterate over all nodes and keep track of the shortest distance found so far to the target node. Initialize it with a very large number (99999).\n4. For each node, find its shortest distance to the target node by considering its neighbors that are not yet visited.\n5. Update the shortest distance found so far for each node by considering its new distance and the distance from its neighbors to the target node.\n6. After iterating over all nodes, return the shortest distance found in the distance array.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform this task:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination):\n    distance = [99999] * len(graph['nodes'])  # initialize distance array with a large number\n    visited = [False] * len(graph['nodes'])  # initialize visited array with False\n    shortest_distance = float('inf')  # initialize shortest distance to target node with infinity\n\n    heap = [(0, start_node)]  # initialize priority queue with (distance, node) pairs\n\n    while heap:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(heap)  # pop the minimum distance node from the priority queue\n        if current_distance < shortest_distance:  # update shortest distance if needed\n            shortest_distance = current_distance\n        visited[current_node] = True  # mark current node as visited\n\n        for neighbor in graph['edges'][current_node]:  # traverse neighbors of current node that are not visited\n            if not visited[neighbor]:  # if neighbor is not visited yet\n                new_distance = current_distance + 1  # calculate new distance from current node to neighbor\n                if new_distance < shortest_distance:  # update shortest distance if needed\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, (new_distance, neighbor))  # add neighbor to priority queue with new distance\n                else:  # if new distance is already in queue, ignore it\n                    continue\n                if neighbor == destination:  # if we reached the target node, return the shortest path\n                    path = []\n                    while current_node != destination:  # traverse back to start node from target node\n                        path.append(current_node)\n                        current_node = visited[current_node]  # move to next node in visited array\n                    path.append(destination)  # append target node to end of path\n                    return path[::-1]  # reverse the path and return it as a list of nodes\n    return None  #
