Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It explores all possible paths in a certain level and then moves to the next level.\n\nHere's the algorithm in action:\n\nStep 1: Create a queue to store nodes to visit. Start by placing node 3 in the queue.\n\nStep 2: Select the next node in the queue by performing a BFS on it (we can call this operation as `getNextNode`). Since there is no edge directly from node 3 to node 5, we will continue from node 2 and follow its edges until we reach node 5. So, node 5 will be placed in the queue.\n\nStep 3: Repeat Step 2 until all nodes have been visited or the target node has been reached.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe shortest path from node 3 to node 5 is: 3 -> 2 -> 7 -> 5.

Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph that are connected by only one edge. It finds the shortest path by considering all nodes along the way and updating the shortest distance to each node as it goes.\n\nHere's the algorithm in action:\n\nStep 1: Create a priority queue to store nodes with the shortest distances to them. Start by placing node 5 in the priority queue with a distance of infinity (since we don't know the exact distance yet).\n\nStep 2: Select the next node in the priority queue that has the smallest distance from node 5 (or infinity). The edge between node 2 and node 3 has a lower weight, so we move to node 2 and remove it from the queue.\n\nStep 3: Repeat Step 2 until node 3 is reached or there are no more nodes to explore.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe shortest path from node 5 to node 3 is: 5 -> 2 -> 3.
