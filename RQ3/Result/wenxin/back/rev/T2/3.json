This is the shortest path because there is no edge from node 4 to node 5 that goes through another node. Therefore, the final answer is: \"shortest path from node 4 to node 5 is: 4->5\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"shortest path from node 4 to node 5 is: 4->5\".\n\nExplanation of each step:\n\n1. We start from node 4 and follow edge 4 -> 3 -> 5. However, because we only have a single edge connecting node 3 to node 5, we have a shorter path from node 4 to node 5 directly by skipping node 3 and following edge 4 -> 5.\n\nIn this case, there is only one shortest path, which is directly from node 4 to node 5 without going through any other intermediate nodes.\n\nThe provided graph represents a simple path, and so there is only one shortest path between any pair of nodes.
