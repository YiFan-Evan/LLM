However, it is not possible to do this in the given graph because there are multiple paths between node 7 and node 1.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to use a graph search algorithm, such as Dijkstra's algorithm or A* search algorithm. These algorithms can find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph efficiently.\n\nHere's how Dijkstra's algorithm would work for this problem:\n\n1. Initialize a priority queue with all nodes in the graph, with their distances to the target node (in this case, node 1) set to infinity. The priority queue will be used to find the shortest path.\n2. Iterate through the nodes in the priority queue, removing them one by one until there are no more nodes left.\n3. For each node in the priority queue, update its distance to the target node by considering all neighboring nodes that have not been processed yet.\n4. If the distance of a node has been updated to be less than or equal to its previous distance, remove it from the priority queue and add it to the shortest path list.\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until there are no more nodes left in the priority queue.\n\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 7 to node 1 is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->3->5->1\n\nNote: This is just one possible shortest path from node 7 to node 1.
