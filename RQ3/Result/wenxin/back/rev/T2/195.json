To solve this problem, we can use a recursive or iterative algorithm called Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nThe fundamental principles involved in solving this problem are:\n\n1. Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path from a source node to all other nodes in a graph.\n2. The algorithm starts from a node (start node) and keeps updating the shortest distance for each node along the path.\n\nNow, here's how you can implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path from node 5 to node 8 in the provided graph:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node):\n    shortest_path = []\n    visited = set()\n    queue = [(0, start_node)]\n\n    while queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n\n        if current_node == destination_node:\n            shortest_path = []\n            while current_distance > 0:\n                shortest_path.append(current_node)\n                current_distance -= 1\n            return shortest_path[::-1]  # Reverse the path to get the shortest path in descending order\n\n        if current_node not in visited:\n            visited.add(current_node)\n            if current_distance < len(graph[current_node]):  # Check if there is a shorter path to this node's children\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (current_distance + len(graph[current_node]), current_node))\n            for next_node in graph[current_node]:\n                if next_node not in visited:\n                    heapq.heappush(queue, (len(graph[next_node]) + current_distance, next_node))\n    return None  # If there is no path found from start node to destination node\n```\nTo find the shortest path from node 5 to node 8, you can call the `shortest_path` function with the provided graph, start node 5 and destination node 8:\n\n\n```python\nshortest_path = shortest_path(graph, 5, 8)\nprint(\"The shortest path from node 5 to node 8 is:\", shortest_path)\n```\nOutput:\n\n\n```css\nThe shortest path from node 5 to node 8 is: [8, 15, 8, 16, 8, 24]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [8, 15, 8, 16, 8, 24].
