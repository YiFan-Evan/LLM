Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It uses a priority queue to maintain the shortest distances to each node and updates these distances as it proceeds through the graph.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Create a priority queue with the nodes in the graph, where the priority is determined by the shortest distance to the destination node.\n2. Add node 4 to the queue with a distance of infinity (as it is the starting node).\n3. Add node 0 to the queue with a distance of infinity (as it is the destination node).\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t- Remove the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\n\t- If the removed node is not part of the target path, ignore it.\n\t- Else, update the shortest path distance for all adjacent nodes to the removed node using the updated distance and continue until reaching node 0.\n5. The final shortest path distance for node 4 to node 0 will be recorded in the priority queue and is the path traversed through nodes 4 -> 3 -> 5 -> 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->3->5->0\n\nNote: The provided graph is not complete, so there may be multiple shortest paths between any two nodes.
