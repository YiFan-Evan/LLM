In this case, the source node is 9 and the target node is 2.\n\nNext, we need to initialize a priority queue with all the nodes in the graph. The priority queue will be used to store the nodes with the shortest distance to the target node.\n\nThe algorithm will then iterate through the nodes in the priority queue and update their distances to the target node. It will also remove any nodes that have reached their shortest distance from the queue.\n\nAfter completing this process, we will have a list of nodes that have a shortest distance to the target node, which we can use to find the shortest path.\n\nHere's how we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm using Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph['nodes']}  #
