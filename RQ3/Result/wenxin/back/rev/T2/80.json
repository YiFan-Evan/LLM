Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given node and explores all the adjacent nodes in a breadth-first manner until it reaches the target node.\n2. Recursive backtracking: Once we reach the target node, we need to backtrack and try other possible paths until we find the shortest path.\n\nAlgorithm implementation:\n\n1. Start with node 1 as the initial node.\n2. Initialize an empty set or list called `shortest_path` to keep track of the shortest path so far.\n3. Apply breadth-first search algorithm starting from node 1 and follow the adjacent nodes as per the given edges.\n4. When you reach node 5, you have found a path from node 1 to node 5.\n5.
