Then, we start BFS from node 5 by using it as the starting node and creating a queue with nodes that can be reached from node 5.\n\nHere's how the algorithm works:\n\n1. Start BFS from node 5.\n2. At each step, remove the first node from the queue and add its neighbors to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\n3.
