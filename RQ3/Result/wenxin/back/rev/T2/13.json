Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph by considering the shortest distance to each node along the way.\n\nHere's how we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 5:\n\n1. Initialize a priority queue (or heap) with the nodes that have no edges to other nodes. These nodes are called \"start nodes\" in Dijkstra's algorithm. In our case, there are no start nodes, so we can skip this step.\n2. While the priority queue is not empty:\n\t1. Extract the node with the smallest priority from the queue.\n\t2. Remove all edges that connect the extracted node to other nodes.\n\t3. For each neighbor of the extracted node, check if its distance to the target node is smaller than the current shortest distance to the target node. If so, update the shortest distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\n3. The final shortest path will be in the priority queue after all nodes have been processed.\n\nIn our case, after executing this algorithm, we will get the shortest path from node 3 to node 5:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->2->4->5 (length: 2)\n\nThis path has a length of 2 because we follow two edges (edges [0, 6] and [2, 4]) to reach node 5.
