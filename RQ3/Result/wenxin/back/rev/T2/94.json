Breadth-first search (BFS): BFS is a greedy algorithm that explores the graph in a breadth-first manner, starting from a given node and moving to its neighbors before moving to the next level of neighbors.\n\n2. Depth-first search (DFS): DFS explores the graph in a depth-first manner, starting from a given node and moving to its neighbors before moving to any node that is not yet visited.\n\nTo find the shortest path from node 10 to node 1 using BFS, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Create an empty stack to store the visited nodes.\n2. Start from node 10 and mark it as visited.\n3. Move to the first neighbor of node 10 (node 9).\n4. Move to the next neighbor of node 9 (node 1).\n5. Continue this process until reaching the target node (node 1).\n6. Push the current node (node 1) back onto the stack, and repeat the process for all its unvisited neighbors.\n7. If a shorter path exists, the stack will have an entry for a node with a lower index number. The shortest path will be that node plus the shortest path between it and its previous neighbors.\n\nNow let's implement this in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport sys  # Used to access system function such as stack.push() and stack.pop()\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef shortest_path(nodes, edges, start, dest):\n    # Initialize adjacency list\n    adjacency_list = defaultdict(list)\n    for i in range(len(nodes)):\n        for j in range(len(edges)):\n            if nodes[edges[j][0]] == i:\n                adjacency_list[i].append(nodes[edges[j][1]])\n    \n    # Create a queue for BFS\n    queue = deque([start])\n    visited = set()  # Set to track visited nodes\n    visited.add(start)\n    path = []  # Store the path from start to dest\n    path.append(dest)  # Add dest as first element of path\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()  # Pop the first node from queue\n        for neighbor in adjacency_list[node]:  # Get neighbors of current node\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # If neighbor is not visited, check if it is on the path\n                visited.add(neighbor)  # Add neighbor to visited set and possibly add it to queue if it was not on the path before this node was reached (not shorter path)\n                if neighbor in path:  # If there is a shorter path to reach this neighbor before reaching current node, keep adding shorter paths\n                    temp = []  # Initialize temporary list to keep shorter paths that are added after current node was reached (not shortest path)\n                    while neighbor not in path:  # Keep adding shorter paths until it is reached or there are no more paths left (i.e., shortest path)\n                        temp.append(neighbor)  # Add current neighbor to temp list if it is not reached yet or there are no more paths left (i.e., shortest path)\n                        neighbor = temp[-1]  # Move to next shortest path after current node was reached (i.e., shortest path)\n                    queue.append(temp[-1])  # Add shortest path to queue for next iteration of BFS if it is not already there (i.e., shortest path)\n                else:  # If there is no shorter path to reach this neighbor before reaching current node, keep track of this in path and queue for next iteration of BFS (shortest path)\n                    path.append(neighbor)  # Add shortest path to path list\n    return path  # Return the shortest path from start to dest as list of nodes in format 1->2->3->4...\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [1, 2, 3, 4] .
