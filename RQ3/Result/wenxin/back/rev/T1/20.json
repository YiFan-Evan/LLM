Start from the given starting node (6).\n2. Move to the next adjacent node based on the graph's edges, maintaining the shortest possible path.\n3. Repeat this process until you reach the destination node (2).\n\nNow, let's follow these principles to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 2:\n\n1. Start from node 6 and follow the edge [6, 5].\n2. Then, follow the edge [5, 4] (which is the next shortest path).\n3.
