Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Start from the starting node, 5.\n2. Move to node 4 using the edge 5->3, because there is no direct edge from node 5 to node 4.\n3. Then, move to node 2 using the edge 3->4.\n4. Finally, move to node 6 using the edge 2->7, which is the shortest path from node 5 to node 4.\n\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 is: 5->3->4->7->6.\n\nNote: The shortest path may involve multiple edges, but in this case, it's a single edge.
