BFS is a technique used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph by using a queue data structure.\n\nHere's how you can find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty queue to store the nodes in the BFS.\n2. Start with node 10 as the first node in the queue.\n3. Initialize a set of visited nodes as an empty set.\n4. In a loop, keep popping nodes from the queue until it's empty or all nodes have been visited.\n5. In each iteration, add the popped node to the visited set.\n6.
