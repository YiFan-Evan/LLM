Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given node and explores all the adjacent nodes in a breadth-first manner until it reaches the target node.\n2. Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is another commonly used method for finding shortest paths in a graph. It works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes, where the shortest path to each node is maintained. It then selects the node with the shortest path and expands its adjacent nodes until it reaches the target node.\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing BFS algorithm, we can find the shortest path from node 2 to node 8 by performing the following steps:\n\n1. Initialize the start node 2 and target node 8 as source and destination nodes respectively.\n2. Initialize a set of visited nodes and an empty queue.\n3. Set the distance between node 2 and node 8 to infinity as there is no direct edge from node 2 to node 8.\n4. Set the distance between node 2 and itself as 0 as it is the starting node.\n5. Add node 2 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n6. While the queue is not empty:\n\t1. Extract the first node from the queue.\n\t2. If the extracted node is equal to target node 8, break the loop and return the shortest path.\n\t3. For each adjacent node of the extracted node:\n\t\t* If the adjacent node is not visited:\n\t\t\t- Set its distance to be the minimum of its distance and distance from extracted node to its neighboring node plus 1.\n\t\t\t- Mark it as visited.\n\t\t* Otherwise:\n\t\t\t- Continue to the next adjacent node of the extracted node if it has already been visited before.\n7.
