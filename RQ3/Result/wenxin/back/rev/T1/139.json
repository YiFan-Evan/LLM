Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given starting node and explores all the adjacent nodes in a level before moving to the next level.\n\nNow, let's apply the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 0:\n\n1.

Add starting node (node 3) to the queue: We add node 3 to the queue as our starting point.\n3.
