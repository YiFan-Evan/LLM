Here's how you can solve this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n**Explanation of Principles**\n\nDijkstra's algorithm is a greedy, goal-directed, and single-source shortest path algorithm. It calculates the shortest distances between nodes by considering only the shortest distances to neighboring nodes. It maintains a priority queue, where the nodes are sorted according to their distance from the start node.\n\n**Solution**\n\n1. Initialize the priority queue with the start node (node 2) at distance 0.\n2. Iterate over the nodes in the priority queue, removing them one by one. For each node, update its distance to all neighboring nodes that have not been processed yet.\n3. If a neighboring node has a shorter distance to the target node (node 3), update its distance and add it to the priority queue.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes have been processed or no more shorter paths are found.\n\n**Code for Dijkstra's Algorithm**\n\nPython code for Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start):\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph['nodes']}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    priority_queue = [(0, start)]\n    visited = set()\n    \n    while priority_queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n        if current_node in visited: continue\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        for neighbor, edge_distance in graph['edges'][current_node].items():\n            distance = current_distance + edge_distance\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))\n    return distances\n\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': {\n        0: {1: 2, 6: 5},  # node 0 is connected to node 1 with edge distance 2 and to node 6 with edge distance 5\n        1: {2: 3},  # node 1 is connected to node 2 with edge distance 3\n        2: {3: 4},  # node 2 is connected to node 3 with edge distance 4\n        3: {4: 1},  # node 3 is connected to node 4 with edge distance 1 (the target node)\n        4: {7},  # node 4 is connected to node 7 with no edge distance specified (infinity)\n        5: {7},  # node 5 is connected to node 7 with edge distance infinity (not included in graph)\n    }\n}\nstart_node = 2  # Start from node 2\ntarget_node = 3  # Target node is node 3 (distance to it is not specified in the graph)\nprint(dijkstra(graph, start_node))  # Returns the shortest path as a list of nodes and their distances to the target node.
