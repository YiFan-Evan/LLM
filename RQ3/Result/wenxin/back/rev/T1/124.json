We start by assigning a distance or cost for each edge based on the graph edges array. The distance between any two nodes is equal to the length of the path connecting them.\n2. For the starting node, we set the distance to zero. For the rest of the nodes, we start with an arbitrarily large number, which will be decreased as we traverse the graph.\n3. We keep track of the shortest distance to reach each node, as well as the node that has the shortest distance to reach it.\n4. We follow the shortest path from node 4 to node 1 by following the shortest distance and checking the next node in the graph that has a shorter distance.\n\nAnswer in form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \":\n\nIn this case, there are two possible shortest paths from node 4 to node 1:\n\n1. 4 -> 9 -> 6 -> 11 -> 1\n2. 4 -> 0 -> 8 -> 7 -> 5 -> 7 -> 1\n\nTherefore, the shortest path is:\n\n4->9->6->11->1\n\nNote: This is a single shortest path, not a list of nodes.
