Define the start node as node 3 and the target node as node 9.\n2. Create an empty set of nodes to visit (nodes_visited).\n3. Initialize a variable (dist_array) with the distances to each node, initially setting them to infinity (since we don't know the distances from start to all other nodes yet).\n4. Iterate over all nodes in the graph (except the start node) and add them to the nodes_visited set.\n5. Calculate the distances for all nodes in nodes_visited using Dijkstra's algorithm: find the minimum distance for each node, then use that minimum distance to calculate the shortest path from start to each node in nodes_visited.\n6.
