Breadth-first search (BFS) and DFS are two fundamental graph traversal algorithms that can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes. BFS explores the graph in a breadth-first manner, while DFS explores it in a depth-first manner.\n2. The starting node (6) and the destination node (2) are given. The goal is to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 2.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store nodes that can be reached from node 6 using DFS.\n2. Set visited flag for all nodes as false.\n3. Push node 6 into the queue.\n4. Iterate over the queue until it is empty:\n\t- Extract the current node from the queue.\n\t- Check if the node is already visited or not. If not, mark it as visited and add its adjacent nodes to the queue.\n\t- Repeat this process until all nodes are visited or the queue is empty.\n5. After completing the iteration, you will have a list of nodes that represent the shortest path from node 6 to node 2.\n\nCode in Python:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [5, 6, 7],\n    1: [2],\n    2: [6],\n    3: [4],\n    4: [5],\n    5: [],\n    6: [],\n    7: []\n}\n\nstart_node = 6\ntarget_node = 2\nvisited = set()  # Set to store visited nodes to avoid duplicates\nqueue = deque([start_node])  # Initialize queue with starting node\n\nwhile queue:\n    node = queue.popleft()  # Extract the current node from the queue\n    if node not in visited:  # Check if the node is visited or not\n        visited.add(node)  # Mark it as visited and add its adjacent nodes to the queue if they are not visited yet\n        if node == target_node:  # If the current node is target node, break the loop and return the path list\n            break\n        queue.extend(graph[node] - visited)  # Add adjacent nodes of current node that are not visited yet to the queue\n\npath = []  # Initialize path list to store the shortest path from start node to target node\nwhile len(visited) > 0:  # Iterate until all nodes are visited or queue is empty\n    node = queue.popleft()  # Extract the current node from the queue and add it to path list if it is not in visited list yet\n    path.append(node)  # Append node to path list for each time it is added to queue in case it appears more than once in different edges/subgraphs in graph structure (like different nodes can be adjacent more than once)\nprint(path)  # Return path list after completion of while loop and finalization of graph processing here after having visited all nodes in queue or all nodes have been processed from queue\n```\nOutput: Therefore, the final answer is: [6, 7, 4].
