BFS is a recursive algorithm that explores the graph by moving from one node to its neighbors, and then to their neighbors, and so on. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes that need to be visited next.\n\nHere's how you can find the shortest path from node 6 to node 4 using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue Q.\n2. Set the start node 6 as the current node.\n3. Enqueue node 6 into Q.\n4. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Dequeue a node from Q.\n\t2. Check if the dequeued node is node 4. If it is, then you have found the shortest path.\n\t3. For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n\t\t- If the neighbor is not yet visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it into Q.\n5. If you don't find the shortest path from node 6 to node 4 after following all possible paths, then the path does not exist.\n\nIn Python, here's an implementation of the above algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, dest):\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    queue = deque([start])  # Queue to keep track of nodes to be visited next\n    path = []  # Path to follow from start to dest\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()  # Dequeue a node from queue\n        if node == dest:  # If we reach the destination, return the path\n            return path + [dest]\n        path += node  # Add the dequeued node to the path\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # If the neighbor is not yet visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)  # Mark it as visited and enqueue it into queue\n                queue.append(neighbor)  # Enqueue it into queue\n    return None  # If we don't find the shortest path after following all possible paths, return None\n```\nNow, let's use this function to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 4:\n\n\n```python\ngraph = {0: [1], 2: [14], 3: [4], 5: [21], 6: [21], 7: [21], 8: [24], 9: [19], 10: [24], 11: [12, 23, 19], 13: [19], 15: [19], 16: [24], 18: [21], 19: [20, 22], 20: [22]}  #
