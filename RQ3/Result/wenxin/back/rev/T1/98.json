Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given node and explores all the adjacent nodes in a breadth-first manner until it reaches the target node.\n2. Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is similar to BFS, but it uses a priority queue to efficiently find the shortest path between two nodes. It is more suitable for large graphs with many nodes and edges.\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing BFS algorithm, the shortest path from node 8 to node 9 can be found as follows:\n\n1. Start from node 8 and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue Q and add node 8 to it.\n3. Create an empty set P to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Extract the first node u from Q.\n\t2. For each neighbor v of u:\n\t\t- If v is not in P:\n\t\t\t- Add v to Q (if it is not already in Q)\n\t\t\t- Add v to P (mark as visited)\n\t5. If we reached node 9, then we have found the shortest path from node 8 to node 9, otherwise go back to step 4.\n\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 8 to node 9 is 8->2->6->9.
