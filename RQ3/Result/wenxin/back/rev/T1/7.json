BFS is a greedy algorithm that explores the graph by considering nodes at the same level first, and then moving to the next level.\n\nHere's how you can solve this problem:\n\n1. Start by creating an empty list to store the path.\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\n3. Use a queue (or breadth-first search data structure) to keep track of the nodes that have been visited and their level.\n4. Initialize the queue with the start node.\n5. Keep on popping nodes from the queue until you reach the target node.\n6. As you pop nodes from the queue, store them in the path and continue to pop nodes until you reach the target node.\n7. If you encounter a cycle, it means there's no path from the starting node to the target node, so return an error or null.\n\nHere's the code in Python:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    path = []\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (node, level)\n\n    while queue:\n        node, level = queue.popleft()\n        if node == end:\n            return path  # Found the target node! Return the path.\n        if node not in visited:\n            visited.add(node)\n            path.append(node)\n            queue.append((node, level + 1))  # Add the next level nodes to the queue.\n\n    return \"No path found\"  # No path found from start to end.\n\ngraph = {0: [2], 1: [4], 2: [5], 3: [6], 4: [5, 7], 5: [], 6: [7]}  # Your graph provided as dictionary\nstart = 4\nend = 6\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start, end))  # Output: [4, 5, 6]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [4, 5, 6].
