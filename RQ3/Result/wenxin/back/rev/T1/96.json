We start by considering the node 5 as our starting point and create a queue Q, where the nodes will be added in the order of their distance from the starting point.\n2. Then, we start a BFS from node 5, which means we move to the neighbors of node 5 (the edges in the graph).\n3. We check each edge in turn, starting with the edge that has the smallest distance to node 5.\n4. If the edge is not yet visited, we add the adjacent node to Q and remove it from the list of unvisited nodes.\n5. We repeat this process until we reach the target node 4.\n\nHere's how you can implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Define the graph as an adjacency list\ngraph = {\n    0: [10],\n    1: [2],\n    2: [4],\n    3: [8, 7],\n    4: [],\n    5: [6],\n    6: [12],\n    7: [],\n    8: [],\n    9: [],\n    11: [12],\n}\n\n# Create a list of nodes to be visited (start from node 5)\nnodes_to_visit = [5]\nvisited = set()  #
