Start from the starting node (node 10).\n2. Follow the edges in the graph to reach the next node.\n3. Repeat step 2 until you reach the destination node (node 4).\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n1. Start from node 10 and follow edge 10 -> 11 -> 12 -> 4, which results in node 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: node 10->11->12->4.\n\nIn other words, the shortest path from node 10 to node 4 is through nodes 11, 12, and then node 4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 9], [0, 7], [1, 4], [2, 11], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 8], [3, 11], [7, 11], [10, 11], [11, 12]]} The end node: 4 The start node: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u627e\u5230\u4ece\u8282\u70b910\u5230\u8282\u70b94\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u9700\u8981\u9075\u5faa\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u6309\u7167\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u539f\u5219\u8fdb\u884c\u3002\n\n\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\uff1a\n\n1. \u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b9\u5f00\u59cb\u3002\n2. \u6cbf\u7740\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8fb9\u79fb\u52a8\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\u3002\n\n\u7b97\u6cd5\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\n\n1. \u4ece\u8282\u70b910\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u8fb9[0, 6]\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5230\u8fbe\u8282\u70b96\u3002\n2. \u7136\u540e\u6839\u636e\u8fb9[0, 9]\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5230\u8fbe\u8282\u70b99\u3002\n3. \u518d\u6839\u636e\u8fb9[9, 4]\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b94\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u4e3a\uff1a10 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u4ece\u8282\u70b910\u5230\u8282\u70b94\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u662f\uff1a10 -> 6 -> 9 -> 4\u3002"}]
