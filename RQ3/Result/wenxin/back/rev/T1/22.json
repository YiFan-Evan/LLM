Initialize the distance array with all nodes set to infinity except for the start node, which is set to 0.\n2. Initialize a set of visited nodes to contain the start node.\n3. Iterate over all nodes in the graph until there are no more nodes to visit:\n\t* Find the node with the smallest distance from the start node and add it to the visited set.\n\t* For each node adjacent to the current node, update its distance if it is not already in the visited set.\n4.
