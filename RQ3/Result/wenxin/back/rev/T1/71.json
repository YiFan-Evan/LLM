Initialize an empty priority queue Q and an empty set S to store the current shortest distances from the start node. Initially, all nodes in the graph are assigned infinite distances from the start node.\n2. Add node 2 to S and set its distance to 0 (the distance from the start node).\n3. Iterate over Q while it is not empty.\n\t* Remove the minimum element in Q (the current shortest distance) and store it in minDist.\n\t* For each neighbor of the current node, update its distance to minDist + length of edge between them.\n\t* If the updated distance is lower than what was in S, update S with the new distance and re-add the neighbor to Q if it wasn't already there.\n4. Once Q is empty, all nodes that can be reached from node 2 are identified and their shortest paths are in S. The shortest path from node 2 to node 6 is in S because node 6 is directly connected to node 2 (the edge [2, 6] exists in the graph).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [2, 3, 6]\n\nThis is the shortest path from node 2 to node 6 in the given graph.
