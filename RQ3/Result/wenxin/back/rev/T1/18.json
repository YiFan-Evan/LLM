Initialize a set of nodes called \"visited\" and initialize its size to the number of nodes in the graph.\n2. Initialize a priority queue with a priority function that assigns a priority to each node based on its distance from the target node. The priority of a node is the distance from the target node to it.\n3. Iterate over the nodes in the queue until it is empty:\n\t* Remove the node with the smallest distance from the target node from the queue.\n\t* Mark this node as \"visited\".\n\t* For each neighbor of this node that is not yet visited, update its distance to the target node by adding the length of the edge between this node and its neighbor.\n\t* If this new distance is less than the distance of any node in the visited set, mark this neighbor as \"visited\" and update its distance.\n4. The path from node 6 to node 2 is the sequence of nodes that were removed from the queue in order of decreasing distance from the target node.\n\nCode in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)\n    path = []\n    while queue:\n        (distance, current) = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        if current == end:\n            path = [current] + path  # reverse the path if needed\n            break\n        if current not in visited:\n            visited.add(current)\n            for neighbor in graph[current]:\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    heapq.heappush(queue, (distance + graph[current][neighbor], neighbor))\n    return path\n```\nTo find the shortest path from node 6 to node 2, you can use the above function as follows:\n\n```python\ngraph = {0: [1, 3], 1: [2], 2: [5], 3: [7], 4: [7], 5: [6, 7], 6: [2], 7: []}  # your graph given above\nstart = 6  # start node\nend = 2  # destination node\npath = shortest_path(graph, start, end)\nprint(\"Shortest path:\", path)  # output: Shortest path: [6, 5, 2]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: Shortest path: [6, 5, 2].
