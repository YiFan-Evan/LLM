However, as you mentioned, these algorithms typically require a search space to be represented as a graph or a tree, and the provided data structure is an array of nodes and edges. Therefore, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path in this case.\n\nHere's how you can find the shortest path from node 3 to node 13 using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue `q` to store the nodes that will be visited in the BFS.\n2. Set the start node `start_node` to 3.\n3. Set the target node `target_node` to 13.\n4. Set the distance `dist` of each node to infinity (except for the start node).\n5. Set the distance `dist` of the start node to 0.\n6. Add the start node to the queue `q`.\n7. Iterate over the queue `q` until it is empty:\n\t* Remove the first node `node` from the queue `q`.\n\t* Check if `node` is equal to the target node `target_node`. If so, return the path from node 3 to node 13 (`node` will be included in the path).\n\t* For each adjacent node `adj_node` of `node`:\n\t\t+ If `dist[adj_node]` is greater than the distance `dist[node] + 1` to `adj_node`, update `dist[adj_node]` with `dist[node] + 1`.\n\t\t+ Add `adj_node` to the queue `q`.\n8. If the target node is not reached after visiting all nodes in the queue, return \"No path found\".\n\nHere's the Python code for implementing this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef bfs(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes.\n    queue = deque([start_node])  # Queue for BFS.\n    dist = {node: float('inf') for node in graph['nodes']}  # Distance of each node.\n    dist[start_node] = 0  # Distance from start node to itself is 0.\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()  # Pop the first node from queue.\n        if node == target_node:  # Found target node?\n            path = []  # Initialize path list.\n            while node != start_node:  # Reverse the path to get the correct order.\n                path.append(node)  # Add nodes in reverse order to start from end.\n                node = graph['nodes'][node]  # Move to next node.\n            path = list(reversed(path))  # Reverse again to get correct order.\n            return path  # Return the path from start node to target node.\n        for adj_node in graph['edges']:  # For each adjacent node of current node:\n            if adj_node in visited:  # If already visited: skip it!\n                continue\n            if dist[adj_node] > dist[node] + 1:  # Update distance if it's shorter or equal (may skip duplicates).\n                dist[adj_node] = dist[node] + 1\n                queue.append(adj_node)  # Add it to queue for next iteration.\n        visited.add(node)  # Mark as visited.\n    return \"No path found\"  # If target node is not reached after visiting all nodes in queue, return \"No path found\".\n```\nNow you can use this function by providing your starting and target nodes and it will return the shortest path from node 3 to node 13 as a list of nodes (in reverse order).
