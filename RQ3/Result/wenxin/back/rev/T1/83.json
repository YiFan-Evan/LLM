BFS is a greedy algorithm that explores the graph in a breadth-first manner, starting from the starting node and moving to adjacent nodes in order of their distance from the start node.\n\nAlgorithm steps:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue for BFS\n2. Insert node 1 into the queue as the first node\n3. Set a distance variable to indicate the current distance to the target node\n4.
