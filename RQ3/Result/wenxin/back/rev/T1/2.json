Start with the node you want to reach (node 1 in this case).\n2. Find the shortest distance to any node adjacent to the starting node.\n3. Continue this process until you reach the target node (node 1 in this case).\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from node 5 to node 1 is:\n\n* Node 5 (distance: 0)\n* Node 6 (distance: 1)\n* Node 7 (distance: 2)\n* Node 4 (distance: 3)\n* Node 1 (shortest distance to node 1)\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->6->7->4->1\n\nNote that there may be multiple shortest paths between two nodes in a graph, and this algorithm will return any of them.
