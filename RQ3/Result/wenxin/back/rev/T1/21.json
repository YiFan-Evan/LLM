Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm is a standard graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path from a given node to all other nodes in the graph.\n2. Depth-first search (DFS) algorithm is a more advanced version of BFS that can handle cyclic or looped edges.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Define a function to perform DFS on the graph starting from node 2:\n\n\n```python\ndef dfs(graph, start, target):\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    path = []  # List to store the path\n    \n    # Start DFS from node 2\n    path.append(start)\n    visited.add(start)\n    while path:\n        node = path[-1]  # Get the last node of the path\n        if node == target:  # If we reach the target node, return the path\n            return path\n        for next_node in graph[node]:  # Get the next nodes for the current node\n            if next_node not in visited:  # If the next node is not visited, add it to the path and add to visited set\n                visited.add(next_node)\n                path.append(next_node)\n```\n2.
