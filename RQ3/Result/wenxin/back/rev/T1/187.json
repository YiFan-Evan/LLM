To find the shortest path, we need to identify the shortest distance between each pair of nodes in the graph.\n2.

Initialize a priority queue with all nodes in the graph, with their distance to the target node (node 1) set to infinity. The initial priority queue will contain all nodes with distance infinity except for the target node (node 1).\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue and remove it. Then, traverse its neighboring nodes in the graph until reaching a node with no unvisited neighboring nodes.\n3.
