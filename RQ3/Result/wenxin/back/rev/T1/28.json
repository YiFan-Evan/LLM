Here's how you can use Dijkstra's algorithm to solve this problem:\n\nFirst, initialize the shortest path distances and paths for all nodes to be infinite or some large number (depending on what your data type allows).\n\nThen, find the vertex with the smallest distance from the start node and update the distances of all nodes to the path including the found node and all nodes adjacent to it in the graph.\n\nContinue this process until we reach the target node (in this case, node 4).\n\nHere's how you can implement it in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, dest):\n    # Initialize shortest distances and paths for all nodes\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph['nodes']}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    paths = {node: [] for node in graph['nodes']}\n\n    # Create priority queue with distances from start node\n    priority_queue = [(0, start)]\n\n    while priority_queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n\n        # If we reached the destination node, return the path\n        if current_node == dest:\n            return paths[current_node]\n\n        # Get all adjacent nodes of current node and update distances if necessary\n        for adjacent_node, distance in graph['edges'][current_node].items():\n            current_path = paths[current_node] + [adjacent_node]\n            distances[adjacent_node] = min(distances.get(adjacent_node, float('infinity')),\n                                           current_distance + distance)\n            heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distances[adjacent_node], adjacent_node))\n            paths[adjacent_node] = current_path + paths.get(adjacent_node, [])\n\n    return \"No path found\"  # Return error message if no path found\n```\nIn this code, `graph` is your provided graph in the form of nodes and edges, `start` is the starting node, and `dest` is the destination node.
