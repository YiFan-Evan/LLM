Initialize a set of visited nodes and a priority queue (or heap) to store the nodes with their shortest distances to the target node. Initially, all nodes are unvisited and the distance to the target node is infinity.\n2. Select the node with the smallest distance from the start node and mark it as visited.\n3. For each of the neighboring nodes of the selected node, check if it has not been visited before. If not, update its distance and priority in the priority queue based on the shortest distance so far.\n4. Repeat step 2 and 3 until the target node is reached or there are no more unvisited nodes.\n\nNow, based on your graph and start node 4 and target node 5, here's the shortest path:\n\n1. Start node 4 has distance infinity initially because it's not connected to any other node.\n2. Step 2 selects node 3 with distance infinity to 5.\n3. Step 3 updates node 4 with distance 2 to node 3 because it's connected to node 3 through edge [4, 3].\n4. Step 2 selects node 5 with distance 2 to 5.\n5.
