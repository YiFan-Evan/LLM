Create a queue (or use a stack if you prefer) to store the nodes that we will visit in the BFS.\n2. Initially, put the start node (node 1) in the queue.\n3. Create an empty set or list to keep track of the visited nodes.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t* Remove the first node from the queue and add it to the visited set.\n\t* For each node adjacent to the current node:\n\t\t+ If the node is not yet visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n5. After completing the BFS, the shortest path will be the sequence of nodes in the visited set that connect node 1 to node 5.\n\nHere's how you can implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\n# The graph represented as an adjacency list\ngraph = {\n    0: [6, 11],\n    1: [7, 12],\n    2: [4, 5],\n    3: [7],\n    4: [],\n    5: [],\n    6: [9],\n    8: [10],\n    9: [],\n    10: [11, 12],\n    11: [],\n    12: []\n}\n\n# Start node is 1 and destination node is 5\nstart_node = 1\ndest_node = 5\n\n# Create a queue for BFS\nqueue = deque([start_node])\nvisited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\nvisited.add(start_node)  # Add start node to visited set\n\nwhile queue:\n    node = queue.popleft()  # Remove first node from queue and add it to visited set\n    for neighbor in graph[node]:  # For each adjacent node of current node\n        if neighbor not in visited:  # If node is not yet visited, add it to queue and mark it as visited\n            queue.append(neighbor)\n            visited.add(neighbor)  # Also add it to visited set for next iteration of BFS\n            break  # Since we only need to add one adjacent node at a time, break after adding it to queue and visited set\n\n# The shortest path is now in the visited set in the format 1->2->3->4->5. You can convert it to your desired format by using appropriate string operations.\nshortest_path = \"->\".join(str(node) for node in visited)  # Assuming you want a string of \"->\" separated nodes as your shortest path format.
