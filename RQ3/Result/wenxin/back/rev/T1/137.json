Initialize a set of visited nodes (vertices) as empty.\n2. For each node in the graph, initialize its distance to the target node as infinity.\n3. Select the node with the smallest distance from the starting node and update the distance of all its adjacent nodes to the target node.\n4. Repeat step 3 until all nodes have been visited.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to our graph:\n\n1. Initialize visited set with node 6 as the starting node.\n2. Initialize distances of all nodes to the target node as infinity except for node 10 which is set to 0 (because it is the target node).\n3. Update distances of nodes 7, 8, and 9 to 6 (node 6) by adding the length of edge (6, 7), (6, 8), and (6, 9).\n4. Node 10's distance is now updated to be the minimum distance of any node that has been visited so far (i.e., 6).\n5. Repeat step 3 until all nodes have been visited.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 6 to node 10 is: 6->7->9->10.\n\nIn this case, the path involves only edges with lengths (6,7), (6,8), and (6,9).\n\nRemember that the provided edges may represent a directed graph where some edges are \"weightier\" than others. Here, the length of an edge represents its \"weight\", and in this case, the shortest path involves only edges with low weight (length)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 13], [1, 11], [2, 8], [2, 5], [3, 6], [4, 5], [4, 6], [5, 9], [6, 14], [7, 11], [7, 9], [8, 13], [10, 12], [10, 14]]} The end node: 10 The start node: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u56fe\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u5411\u56fe\uff0c\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u7ec4\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5217\u8868\u3002\u4f60\u8981\u6c42\u4ece\u8282\u70b96\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u627e\u5230\u5230\u8fbe\u8282\u70b910\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002\n\n\u4e3a\u4e86\u627e\u5230\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u627e\u5230\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u5230\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4f7f\u7528Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u4ece\u8282\u70b96\u5230\u8282\u70b910\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\n\n1. \u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ddd\u79bb\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\uff0c\u9664\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff08\u8282\u70b910\uff09\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3a0\u3002\n2. \u4ece\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ddd\u79bb\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u5df2\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u4e2d\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u8282\u70b96\u3002\n3. \u5bf9\u4e8e\u8be5\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6240\u6709\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\uff08\u8fb9\uff09\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u901a\u8fc7\u8be5\u8282\u70b9\u5230\u8fbe\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5219\u66f4\u65b0\u8be5\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\n4. \u91cd\u590d\u6b65\u9aa42\u548c3\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u90fd\u88ab\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u3002\n\n\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u4e2d\uff0c\u6b65\u9aa43\u4f1a\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u8fb9(6, 7)\uff0c(6, 8)\uff0c(6, 9)\u548c(6, 14)\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fb9\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u6240\u4ee5\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u5c06\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fb9\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u5c06\u4f1a\u662f6->7->9->10\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u7b54\u6848\u662f\uff1a\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u4ece\u8282\u70b96\u5230\u8282\u70b910\u662f\uff1a6->7->9->10\u3002"}]
