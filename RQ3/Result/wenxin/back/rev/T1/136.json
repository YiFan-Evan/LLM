Repeat this process until you reach the target node 12.\n\nThe shortest path from node 6 to node 12 is:\n\n1->5->6->7->8->9->11->12\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->5->6->7->8->9->11->12.\n\nIn general, graph theory problems like this one can be solved using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm, which are based on shortest path finding principles.
