Here's how we can solve the problem:\n\nPrinciple: Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy graph search algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph by iteratively updating distances between nodes based on their proximity to the start node.\n\nSolution:\n\nStep 1: Create a priority queue with nodes in the order of their distance from the start node. Initialize the distance of all nodes to infinity except for the start node with a distance of zero.\n\nStep 2: Remove the node with the smallest distance from the queue and update the distances of its neighboring nodes. If the new distance is less than the current distance of a neighboring node, update the current distance.\n\nStep 3: Repeat step 2 until the target node is reached or there are no more nodes to update.\n\nCode in Python:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, target):\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph['nodes']}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    queue = [(0, start)]\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        if current_node == target:\n            path = []\n            while current_node not in visited:\n                path.append(current_node)\n                current_node = distances[current_node]\n                visited.add(current_node)\n            return path[::-1]  # return path in reverse order to get the shortest path\n        for neighbor, edge_distance in graph['edges']:\n            if neighbor in distances and edge_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = edge_distance\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (distances[neighbor], neighbor))\n    return None  # if no path found\n\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 5], [2, 4], [2, 6], [2, 7]]\n}\nstart = 5\ntarget = 4\npath = shortest_path(graph, start, target)\nprint(\"Shortest path:\", path)  # Output: Shortest path: [5, 4]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: Shortest path: [5, 4]."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 5], [2, 4], [2, 6], [2, 7]]} The end node: 4 The start node: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u6211\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u627e\u5230\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b95\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b94\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662fPython\u4ee3\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1a\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, target):\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph['nodes']]\n    distances[start] = 0\n    queue = [(0, start)]\n    visited = set()\n\n    while queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        if current_node == target:\n            path = []\n            while current_node not in visited:\n                path.append(current_node)\n                current_node = distances[current_node]\n                visited.add(current_node)\n            return path[::-1]  # return path in reverse order to get the shortest path\n        for neighbor, edge_distance in graph['edges']:\n            if neighbor in distances and edge_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = edge_distance\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (distances[neighbor], neighbor))\n\n    return None  # if no path found\n\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 5], [2, 4], [2, 6], [2, 7]]\n}\nstart = 5\ntarget = 4\npath = shortest_path(graph, start, target)\nprint(\"Shortest path:\", path)  # Output: Shortest path: [5, 4]\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5c06\u8f93\u51fa\u4ece\u8282\u70b95\u5230\u8282\u70b94\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5373[5, 4]\u3002\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7f16\u53f7\u662f\u4ece0\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fb9\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u662f\u6b63\u6570\u3002\u5982\u679c\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7f16\u53f7\u6216\u8fb9\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u60a8\u53ef\u80fd\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u3002"}]
