Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy, single-source shortest path algorithm that calculates the shortest path from a single source to all other nodes in the graph.\n\nHere's how you can solve this problem:\n\n1. Define the start node as node 9 and the target node as node 10.\n2. Define a list to keep track of the distances between nodes. Initially, all distances are set to infinity.\n3. Iterate through all nodes from node 9 to node 10.\n4. For each node in the current iteration, calculate the distance to all other nodes based on the edges in the graph and the distance of its adjacent nodes.\n5. If the distance of the node is smaller than the distance recorded in the list so far, update the distance and also update its parent node, which will be used later to get to other nodes in the shortest path.\n6. Continue until you reach node 10 or no more nodes can be reached.\n\nThe shortest path is the sequence of nodes along which you travel to reach your destination from your starting point, starting from node 9. Since our goal is node 10, it means we should take steps towards node 9 and follow an optimal path as few times as possible. This process can be traced through nodes from a particular node back to its original starting point. This shortest path would include node 9 and every node from node 9 that's a direct path to node 10 (e.g., node 13).\n\nNow that we have our shortest path, it would look like this:\n\n* Node 9\n* Node 13\n* Node 10\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->13->10."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 6], [1, 2], [1, 4], [3, 10], [4, 10], [5, 8], [5, 13], [6, 8], [7, 11], [9, 13], [9, 14], [10, 11], [11, 12]]} The end node: 10 The start node: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u627e\u5230\u4ece\u8282\u70b99\u5230\u8282\u70b910\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\n\n1. \u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ddd\u79bb\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u521d\u59cb\u503c\u90fd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\u3002\n2. \u627e\u5230\u8282\u70b99\u5230\u8282\u70b910\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u4ece\u8282\u70b99\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u4ece\u8282\u70b99\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\n3. \u5728\u627e\u5230\u8282\u70b99\u5230\u8282\u70b910\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u8be5\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0e\u8282\u70b910\u5230\u5176\u4ed6\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\n4. \u91cd\u590d\u6b65\u9aa42\u548c\u6b65\u9aa43\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u6240\u6709\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u90fd\u88ab\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\uff0c\u6216\u8005\u6211\u4eec\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u672a\u5904\u7406\u8fc7\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u7b49\u4e8e\u6216\u5c0f\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5df2\u5904\u7406\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\n\n\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b99\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b910\uff0cDijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f1a\u8f93\u51fa\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff1a\n\n* Node 9\n* Node 13\n* Node 10\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u4e3a\uff1a9->13->10\u3002"}]
