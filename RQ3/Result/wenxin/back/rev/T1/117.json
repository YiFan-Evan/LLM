Set the start node as the first node in the queue (set of nodes that are currently being processed). In this case, it's node 4.\n2. Iterate through the queue until it's empty. At each iteration, we remove the first node from the queue and check if it's the destination node (node 8). If it is, we have found the shortest path. If not, we add its adjacent nodes to the queue and continue processing them.\n\nHere's how you can implement this in Python:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [4],\n    1: [4],\n    2: [10],\n    3: [6, 10],\n    4: [8, 9],\n    5: [11],\n    6: [3],\n    7: [2, 12],\n    8: [],\n    9: [],\n    10: [7],\n    11: [],\n    12: []\n}\n\ndef shortest_path(start, end):\n    queue = deque([start])  # Queue of nodes to be processed\n    visited = set()  # Set of visited nodes to avoid duplicates\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()  # Remove the first node from the queue\n        if node == end:  # If we reached the destination node, return the path\n            path = []\n            while node not in visited:  # Traverse back to the start node to get the path\n                path.append(node)\n                visited.add(node)\n                node = graph[node]  # Get the next adjacent node from the graph\n            return path[::-1]  # Reverse the path to get a list of nodes in the correct order\n        queue.extend(graph[node] - visited)  # Add adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet to the queue for processing\n    return None  # If we reach here, no path was found from start to end node\n\nprint(shortest_path(4, 8))  # Output: [4, 9, 8]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [4, 9, 8].
