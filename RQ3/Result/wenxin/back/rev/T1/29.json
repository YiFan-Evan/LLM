BFS is a method of searching that explores all possible paths from the start node to the target node, and finds the shortest path by maintaining a queue of nodes.\n\nHere's how you can find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create a queue to store nodes.\n2. Initially, put node 1 in the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to store visited nodes.\n4. Start BFS from node 1:\n\t* While the queue is not empty:\n\t\t+ Extract the first node from the queue.\n\t\t+ Check if the extracted node is the target node (node 3).\n\t\t\t- If it is, return the list of nodes you visited (it's this: 1->2->3) as the shortest path.\n\t\t\t- Else, mark the extracted node as visited and go to the next level in the graph (this would be to neighbors of nodes in the extracted list).\n\t\t\t\t+ For each neighbor of the extracted nodes, check if it's not already visited and add it to the queue.\n\tContinue this process until you reach node 3.\n\nHere's the Python code to do that:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [4],\n    1: [6],\n    2: [3, 7],\n    3: [],  # an empty list to mark target reached\n    4: [],\n    5: [],\n    6: [],\n    7: [7]\n}\n\nstart_node = 1\ntarget_node = 3\n\nqueue = deque([start_node])  # initialize queue with start node\nvisited = set()  # initialize set for visited nodes\n\nwhile queue:\n    node = queue.popleft()  # pop from queue and get first node\n    if node == target_node:  # check if we reached target node\n        return list(visited)  # return list of visited nodes as shortest path\n    visited.add(node)  # mark as visited and go to next level in graph\n    for neighbor in graph[node]:  # for each neighbor of current node, check if not visited and add to queue\n        if neighbor not in visited:  # if not visited, add to queue\n            queue.append(neighbor)  # add to queue\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [1, 6, 2].
