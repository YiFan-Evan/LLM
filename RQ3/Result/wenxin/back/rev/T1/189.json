It works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes, where each node has a distance value indicating how far it is from the start node. The algorithm iteratively removes the node with the smallest distance value from the queue and expands its neighboring nodes, updating their distances if necessary.\n\nHere's how you can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 20 to node 1:\n\n1. Initialize the priority queue with all nodes in the graph. Assign each node a distance value of infinity (except for the start node, which has a distance value of zero).\n2. Remove the node with the smallest distance value from the queue and assign it a distance value of zero. This is the current shortest distance to the destination node 1.\n3. Iterate through the neighboring nodes of the current node. For each neighboring node, calculate the new distance value by adding the edge weight to the current distance value. If this new distance value is less than or equal to the distance value of any neighboring node, update its distance value accordingly.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes have been processed or no more neighboring nodes exist.\n\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 20 to node 1 is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 20->5->16->19->1\n\nNote: The path traverses nodes in the order specified above.
