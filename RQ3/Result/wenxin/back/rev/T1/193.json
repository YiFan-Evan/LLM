BFS is a recursive algorithm that explores the graph by starting from a given node and moving to adjacent nodes in order to find the shortest path to the target node.\n\nHere's how you can find the shortest path using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue (or use a pre-existing one) to store the nodes.\n2. Set the starting node (node 17) as the first node in the queue.\n3. Set a variable to keep track of the current node. Initially, it should be set to node 17.\n4. Set a variable to keep track of the distance from the starting node to the current node. Initially, it should be set to infinity (or a large number).\n5. Start a loop until the queue is empty:\n\t* Remove the first node from the queue and add it to the current node list.\n\t* Remove all adjacent nodes from the queue and add them to the current node list if they are not already in the list.\n\t* Update the distance variable with the current distance plus the distance between the current node and its adjacent nodes.\n\t* If the current node is equal to the target node (node 22), then you have found the shortest path.\n6. If you reach this point, you can return the list of nodes in order as the shortest path from node 17 to node 22.\n\nHere's the Python code for this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ngraph = {\n    \"nodes\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 22],\n    \"edges\": [\n        [0, 16], [1, 16], [1, 18], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 19], [3, 4], [3, 7], [4, 18], [4, 11],\n        [6, 7], [6, 13], [7, 22], [8, 9], [8, 10], [9, 21], [10, 14], [10, 23], [11, 15],\n        [11, 20], [12, 17], [13, 24]\n    ]\n}\nstart_node = \"start\"  #
