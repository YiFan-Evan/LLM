Breadth-first search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.\n2. To avoid infinite loops, we need to ensure that each edge is traversed in the correct order.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n1. Create a queue Q and initialize it with node 6.\n2. Create an empty set called visited to keep track of nodes that have been visited.\n3. Mark node 6 as visited and add it to the queue Q.\n4. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Dequeue a node v from Q.\n\t2. Check if v is equal to target node 8 and return the shortest path.\n\t3. For each node adjacent to v, if it is not in the visited set:\n\t\t- Add it to the visited set.\n\t\t- Repeat step 4. until no more adjacent nodes are found or target node 8 is reached.\n5. If target node 8 is not reached after going through all possible paths, return \"No path found\".\n\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 6 to node 8 is 6->4->8, which is represented as \"6->4->8\" in your question.
