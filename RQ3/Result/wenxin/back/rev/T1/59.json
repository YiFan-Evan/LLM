This can be done using a priority queue or a stack to keep track of the shortest distances to each node.\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, the shortest path from node 3 to node 6 is:\n\n* Node 3 has a distance of 0 to it.\n* Node 5 has a distance of 2 to it.\n* Node 6 is reached by following edge [5, 6] from node 5, which has a distance of 1 to it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `3->5->6`\n\nNote: This algorithm assumes that there are no negative-weight edges in the graph.
