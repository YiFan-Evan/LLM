We initialize a variable called \"shortest_path\" to be infinity, which will represent the current shortest distance from the start node to any node.\n3. We initialize a variable called \"current_node\" to be the start node (2).\n4. We iterate through all nodes in the graph and check if they are in the visited set. If they are not, we add them to the visited set and start updating the shortest_path variable based on the shortest path distances in the graph.\n5.
