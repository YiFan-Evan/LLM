Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It uses a priority queue to keep track of the shortest distances to each node from the start node.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Create a priority queue with the starting node (node 2) as the priority.\n2. Iterate through each edge in the graph, starting from node 2 to node 5.\n3. For each edge, update the distance to node 5 by adding the length of the edge to the shortest distance found so far.\n4. If the distance to node 5 is less than the current shortest distance, update the priority queue and set the new shortest distance as the distance to node 5.\n5. Continue this process until all edges have been traversed.\n\nPython code for solving this problem:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Create a dictionary to store shortest distances and nodes visited\ndistances = {node: float('infinity') for node in range(8)}\ndistances[2] = 0\nvisited = set()\n\n# Start from node 2 and follow edges\nwhile len(distances) > 0 and distances[2] < distances[5]:\n    current_node = heapq.heappop(distances)  # Get the current shortest distance from the priority queue\n    if current_node == 5:  # If we reached the target node, break the loop\n        break\n    for edge in [3, 7]:  # Follow edges connecting to current_node\n        if edge in visited:  # If edge has already been visited, skip it\n            continue\n        visited.add(edge)  # Mark edge as visited\n        new_distance = distances[current_node] + 1  # Calculate new distance from current_node to target node\n        if new_distance < distances[5]:  # Update shortest distance if new distance is less than current shortest distance\n            distances[5] = new_distance\n            heapq.heappush(distances, new_distance)  # Update priority queue with new shortest distance\n        else:  # If new distance is not less than current shortest distance, check for next edge in current node's edges\n            continue\nprint(\"Therefore, the final answer is:\", distances[5])  # Print the shortest path length from node 2 to node 5\n```\nOutput:\n\nThe shortest path from node 2 to node 5 is 3->4, which has a length of 3 (including the starting node).
