We can start at node 10 and follow the shortest possible path to reach node 6. To find the shortest path, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the distance between each node in the graph and node 10. Then, we will add up the distances to get the shortest path to node 6.\n\nThe fundamental principles involved in solving this problem are:\n\n1. Node distances are initially unknown and need to be calculated.\n2. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.\n\nAlgorithm steps:\n\n1. Create an empty list called \"shortestPath\" that will store the shortest path from node 10 to each node in the graph.\n2. Create a dictionary called \"distances\" that will store the distance from each node to node 10.\n3. Iterate through each node in the graph.\n\t* Initialize distances for each node as infinity (except for node 10, which has a distance of 0).\n\t* Calculate the distance from each node to node 10 using the edges in the graph.\n\t* Update the distances for nodes that have changed their distance (i.e., they are now closer to node 10).\n\t* If a node has a distance of zero, it means it is directly connected to node 10, so add it to the shortestPath list with a reference to its adjacent nodes (the nodes it is connected to).\n4.
