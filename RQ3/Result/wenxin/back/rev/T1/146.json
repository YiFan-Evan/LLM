Define a distance array for each node, initially setting all distances to infinity except for the start node (node 4) and the target node (node 10), which are set to zero.\n2.

Therefore, the shortest path from node 4 to node 10 is through nodes 6 and then directly to node 12. The path is therefore: [4,6,12].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [4,6,12].

Define a distance array for each node, initially setting all distances to infinity except for the start node (node 4) and the target node (node 10), which are set to zero.\n\nFor simplicity, we'll just use a single distance array. It might not be optimal for some cases but it will give us an idea about the shortest path from node 4 to node 10.\n\n2. Find the start node and the target node and mark them as visited in the distance array.\n\nThis step will tell us that the path to node 10 is from node 4 through some intermediate nodes to node 10.\n\n3. Starting from the start node, iterate through each of its adjacent nodes that are not yet visited, and update the distance of each adjacent node to its current distance plus the length of the edge to the adjacent node.\n\nThis step will give us the shortest path from node 4 to node 10.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to our specific case:\n\n* Distance array: {0: 0, 2: Infinity, 4: 4, 6: Infinity, 8: Infinity, 10: 0}\n* Initial state: The start node (node 4) is adjacent to nodes 2 and 6, and the target node (node 10) is adjacent to nodes 6 and 12.\n* Step 2: Nodes 3 and 5 are not visited yet so we can skip them.\n* Step 3: Update distance for node 6 from node 4: Distance(6) = Distance(4) + length of edge from 4 to 6 = 4 + 6 = 10.
