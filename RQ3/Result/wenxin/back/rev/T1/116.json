The basic principles involved are:\n\n1. Start with the target node (3).\n2. Consider each edge emanating from node 10 and all the nodes along the path from 10 to that edge, to check if the next node (which is 3) is in that path.\n\nUsing this technique, the shortest path from node 10 to node 3 can be found using a Dijkstra's algorithm or a breadth-first search algorithm. Here's an implementation of a breadth-first search algorithm in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef bfs(graph, start):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = [(start, 0)]  # Queue for BFS, with distance as second element\n    while queue:\n        node, distance = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        if node not in visited:\n            visited.add(node)\n            for neighbor, neighbor_distance in graph[node]:\n                if neighbor not in visited:\n                    heapq.heappush(queue, (neighbor, distance + neighbor_distance))\n    return visited\n\ngraph = {0: [(-1, 1), (2, 2)], 1: [(-1, 3)], 2: [(-1, 4), (3, 2)], 3: [], 4: [], ...}  # Your graph here\nstart = 10  # Your start node\nend = 3  # Your end node\n\npath = bfs(graph, start)\nnode = end  # Assuming the end node is at the end of the path\nwhile node not in path:\n    node = path.pop()\nprint(\"Shortest path from node {} to node {} is: {}\".format(start, node, path))\n```\nIn this code, we use a queue to keep track of the nodes that we have visited and their distances from the start node. We start with the start node and pop it from the queue. If it is not in the visited set yet, we add it to the visited set and add all its neighbors to the queue if they are not yet visited. We repeat this process until we reach the end node or all nodes have been visited. Finally, we print out the shortest path from start node to end node.\n\nPlease note that this code assumes that there is a path from start node to end node in the graph. If there is no path, it will return an empty list."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 8], [2, 8], [2, 6], [3, 11], [4, 8], [6, 9], [6, 10], [7, 8], [10, 12], [11, 12]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\uff08BFS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u627e\u5230\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b9\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f7f\u7528Python\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u793a\u4f8b\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef bfs(graph, start, end):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = [(start, 0)]  # \u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u961f\u5217\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\n    \n    while queue:\n        node, distance = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        if node == end:\n            return distance, list(visited)  # \u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5217\u8868\n        \n        for neighbor, neighbor_distance in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (neighbor, distance + neighbor_distance))\n    \n    return None, None  # \u5982\u679c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd4\u56deNone\n\ngraph = {0: [(-1, 1), (2, 2)], 1: [(-1, 3)], 2: [(-1, 4), (3, 2)], 3: [], ...}  # Your graph here\nstart = 10  # Your start node\nend = 3  # Your end node\n\ndistance, path = bfs(graph, start, end)\nif distance is not None:\n    print(\"Shortest path from node {} to node {} is: {}\".format(start, end, path))\nelse:\n    print(\"No path found from {} to {}\".format(start, end))\n```\n\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u961f\u5217\uff08queue\uff09\u6765\u5b58\u50a8\u5f85\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u5408\uff08set\uff09\u6765\u8bb0\u5f55\u5df2\u7ecf\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u65ad\u4ece\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u53d6\u51fa\u8282\u70b9\u5e76\u68c0\u67e5\u5176\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u627e\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\u6216\u961f\u5217\u4e3a\u7a7a\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u6700\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5217\u8868\u3002\u5982\u679c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5219\u8fd4\u56deNone\u3002\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u56fe\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b9\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}]
