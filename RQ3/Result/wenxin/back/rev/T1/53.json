Define a distance matrix, initially setting all distances to infinity except for the distance from the start node to itself, which is 0.\n2. For each node in the graph, check its shortest distance to all nodes in the graph that have not yet been processed.\n3. Update the shortest distance to each unprocessed node to be the minimum of the current shortest distance and the distance from the current node to the destination node.\n4. After all nodes have been processed, the shortest path from the start node to the destination node is the sequence of nodes with the shortest distances.\n\nSolution:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->2->4->1\n\nThe shortest path from node 6 to node 1 is through nodes 2, 4. There are no intermediate nodes between nodes 2 and 4, so the path is simply 6->2->4.
