BFS is a greedy algorithm that explores the graph by starting from a given node and then moving to its neighbors before moving to the next level of neighbors.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the nodes that we will explore in the BFS. Initially, add node 5 to the queue.\n2. Initialize an empty set to store visited nodes.\n3. Set a variable to keep track of the current shortest path length. Initialize it with a very large number (infinity) as we don't want to consider paths that are longer than what we've already found.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t* Remove the first node from the queue and add it to the visited set.\n\t* For each adjacent node of the current node:\n\t\t+ If the node is not in the visited set, add it to the queue and increment the shortest path length by 1.\n5.
