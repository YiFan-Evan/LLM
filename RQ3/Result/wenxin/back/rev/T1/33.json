These algorithms find the shortest path from a given starting node to every other node in the graph.\n\nFirst, we need to calculate the distances from the start node to every other node. We can use a dictionary or array to store these distances.\n\nHere's how we can do it using Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a set of nodes that are currently \"unexplored\" or \"unvisited\". Initially, only the start node is in this set.\n2. Initialize a set of nodes that are reachable from the start node. Initially, only node 6 is in this set.\n3. Iterate over the nodes in the unexplored set and find the shortest distance to each one of them. This distance is initially the distance to the start node plus the length of the edge connecting them.\n4. Remove nodes that have a distance greater than their shortest distance from the unexplored set and add them to the reachable set.\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until there are no more nodes in the unexplored set.\n\nHere's the Python code for it:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    unexplored = {node: float('inf') for node in graph['nodes']}  # Initialize unexplored nodes with infinite distances\n    unexplored[start] = 0  # Set start node as 0 distance\n    reachable = {end}  # Set end node as reachable\n    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph['nodes']}  # Store distances between nodes\n    distances[start] = 0  # Distance from start node to itself is 0\n\n    heap = []  # Store nodes that can be reached from the start node for efficient priority queue operations\n    heapq.heappush(heap, (0, start))  # Add start node to priority queue with distance 0\n\n    while heap:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(heap)  # Pop the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:  # If distance is larger than stored distance, ignore it\n            continue\n        for neighbor, edge_length in graph['edges']:  # For each neighbor of current node\n            if neighbor in unexplored and distances[neighbor] > current_distance + edge_length:  # If neighbor is unexplored and has a shorter distance\n                distances[neighbor] = current_distance + edge_length  # Update distance to neighbor\n                unexplored[neighbor] = distances[neighbor] + 1  # Mark neighbor as explored with new distance\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (unexplored[neighbor], neighbor))  # Add neighbor to priority queue if it's not already there\n        reachable.update(unexplored)  # Add reachable nodes from unexplored nodes to reachable set\n\n    return reachable  # Return reachable nodes as the shortest path\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: {6}.
