Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Start from node 2 and follow the edges in the graph until you reach node 4.\n\nExplanation of the fundamental principles involved:\n\n* Depth-first search: This is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the graph in a depth-first manner. It starts from a given node and explores all the possible paths to reach the target node.\n* Graph traversal: To find the shortest path, we need to follow all possible paths in the graph until we reach the target node.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. Create a list to store the shortest path: shortest_path = []\n2. Start from node 2: path = [2]\n3. Explore the possible paths:\n* Follow edges to get to a new node, but do not repeat edges.\n* Add the next node to the path list.\n* Continue exploring until you reach node 4 or exhaust all possible paths.\n\n4. When you reach node 4, append it to the path list: shortest_path.append(4)\n5. If you reach node 4 without repeating any edges, you have found the shortest path from node 2 to node 4.\n\n6. If you reached this point and there are still nodes remaining in the graph, continue exploring them by starting from node 3, as there are no edges from node 4 to other nodes in the graph.\n\nIn conclusion, the final answer is: shortest_path = [2, 10, 4] .

It uses a priority queue to store the nodes with the shortest distances to the target node.\n* Priority queue: It stores nodes with their distances to the target node in a priority order.

Add node 2 to the priority queue with a distance of infinity (or any large number):\n\n* priority_queue.append((2, float('inf')))\n\n3.
