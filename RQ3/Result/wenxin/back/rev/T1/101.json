To do this, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS will start from node 7 and explore all possible paths to reach node 1 by following the edges in the graph.\n\nThe fundamental principles involved in solving this problem are:\n\n1. Start from the starting point (node 7).\n2. Follow the edges in the graph to find the shortest path to the target point (node 1).\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n1. Create an empty queue Q and initialize it with node 7.\n2. Create an empty set S to store visited nodes.\n3. Set a variable called distance to infinity (or a large number) to represent the current distance from node 7 to node 1.\n4. While Q is not empty:\n\t- Remove the first node from Q (let's call it node X).\n\t- If node X is equal to node 1, then break the loop and return the shortest path (i.e., X).\n\t- For each neighbor of node X that is not yet visited:\n\t\t- Add it to S.\n\t\t- Update distance by adding the length of the edge between X and the neighbor.\n\t\t- If distance is smaller than the current shortest path, update the shortest path and reset distance to infinity (or a large number).\n5.
