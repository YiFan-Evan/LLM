BFS is a greedy algorithm that explores the graph in a breadth-first manner, starting from the initial node and moving to adjacent nodes in order of their distance from the starting node.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Initialize Q with the starting node 11.\n3. Initialize an empty set D to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. While Q is not empty:\n\t- Remove the first node from Q and add it to D.\n\t- For each adjacent node of the removed node:\n\t\t+ If the node is not in D:\n\t\t\t- Add it to Q and also to D.\n5. After the while loop is done, D will contain all nodes that are reachable from node 11 to node 13 through a shortest path.\n\nIn Python, the code would look like this:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [3],\n    1: [9],\n    2: [6],\n    3: [12, 10],\n    4: [13, 10],\n    5: [6],\n    6: [13],\n    7: [11, 9],\n    8: [11],\n    9: [14],\n    10: [],  # Empty list for the target node 13\n    11: [],  # Start node\n    12: [],  # Nodes that are reachable from node 11 to node 13\n    13: [],  # Nodes that are reachable from node 13\n    14: []  # Other nodes in the graph\n}\n\ndef bfs(graph, start):\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    queue = deque([start])  # Create a queue with the starting node as its only item\n    visited.add(start)  # Add start node to visited set as well for initialization purposes\n\n    while queue:  # Keep going until the queue is empty\n        node = queue.popleft()  # Remove an item from the queue and get it from the visited set as well for checking if it's already been visited or not\n        for adjacent_node in graph[node]:  # For each adjacent node of the removed node:\n            if adjacent_node not in visited:  # If the adjacent node is not in visited set yet:\n                visited.add(adjacent_node)  # Add it to visited set and queue as well if it's not already there in queue and visited set.\n                queue.append(adjacent_node)  # Add it to queue as well for future use.\n    return visited  # Return the visited set after all nodes have been processed.
