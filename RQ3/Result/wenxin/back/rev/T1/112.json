Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Initialize a priority queue (Q) to hold nodes in the graph, along with their distances to the target node. Initially, all nodes are at infinity distance from the target node.\n2. Set the distance of the start node to 0.\n3. Extract the node with the smallest distance from Q and update the distances of its neighbors based on the shortest path from that node to the target node.\n4. Repeat step 3 until the target node is reached or there are no more nodes to process.\n\nHere's how you can implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}  # Initialize distances as infinity\n    distances[start_node] = 0  # Distance of start node to start node is 0\n    queue = [(0, start_node)]  # Initialize priority queue with start node\n\n    while queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)  # Extract the shortest distance and node from queue\n\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:  # If the distance is larger than the current distance, skip it\n            continue\n\n        for neighbor, edge_weight in graph[current_node].items():\n            distance = current_distance + edge_weight\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:  # Update distances of neighbors if the new distance is shorter\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))  # Add the new neighbor to the queue\n\n    path = []  # Initialize path as an empty list\n    while target_node not in path:  # Append nodes in the order they are reached to path until reaching the target node\n        path.append(target_node)\n        target_node = distances[target_node]  # Get distance of next node to reach and add it to path if it is smaller than the current distance to target_node\n    return path[::-1]  # Reverse the path to get the shortest path in the correct order\n```\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to your graph:\n\n\n```python\ngraph = {i: {} for i in range(13)}  # Initialize graph with nodes and empty dicts for edges\ngraph[0][2] = 1  # Edge 0-2 with weight 1\ngraph[0][7] = 2  # Edge 0-7 with weight 2\ngraph[0][12] = 3  # Edge 0-12 with weight 3\n# Add other edges as needed...\n\nstart_node = 5\ntarget_node = 7\nresult = shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path:\", result)  #
