Initialize the distance array with all zeros, except for the starting node (node 18) which is set to infinity.\n2. Initialize a set of visited nodes with all nodes.\n3. Iterate over all nodes in the graph and update the distance of the node to the target node (node 15) if it is closer to the target node than any other node.\n4.
