Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It repeatedly adds the node with the shortest distance to the solution and updates the distances of the remaining nodes based on their adjacency relationships to the added node.\n\nTo apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph, we first need to create a distance array for the nodes where the value at each position indicates the shortest distance to the corresponding node from the start node. We initialize this array with a large value (e.g., Integer.MAX_VALUE) for all nodes except for node 3, which has a distance of 0.\n\nNext, we iterate through the nodes in the graph starting from node 3. For each node, we add it to the solution if its distance is less than the distance of any other node in the solution. We also update the distances of all adjacent nodes to the current node if their distance is decreased by adding the current node to the solution.\n\nFinally, we return the resulting distance array, which contains the shortest distances from node 3 to all nodes in the graph.\n\nHere's how we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    # Create distance array for all nodes\n    distances = [float(\"inf\")] * len(graph['nodes'])\n    distances[start_node] = 0\n\n    # Initialize priority queue with start node and its distance\n    pq = [(0, start_node)]\n\n    while pq:\n        # Extract minimum distance node from priority queue\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)\n\n        # If we reached target node, return its distance\n        if current_node == target_node:\n            return distances[current_node]\n\n        # Update distances of adjacent nodes of current node if they are closer to target node\n        for neighbor in graph['nodes'][current_node]:\n            distance = distances[current_node] + graph['edges'][current_node][neighbor]\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))\n\n    # If we didn't reach target node after traversing all nodes, return None or error message\n    return None\n```\nNow, let's use this function to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 6:\n\n\n```python\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7]]}\nstart_node = 3\ntarget_node = 6\npath = shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path:\", path)  #
