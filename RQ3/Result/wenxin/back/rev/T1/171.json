BFS is a greedy search algorithm that explores the graph in a breadth-first manner, starting from a given node and moving to its neighbors before moving to the next level of neighbors.\n\nHere's how you can find the shortest path from node 10 to node 9 using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Set the start node 10 as the current node.\n3. Enqueue the start node into Q.\n4. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Dequeue the current node from Q.\n\t2. Check if the dequeued node is the destination node 9. If it is, return the path from node 10 to node 9.\n\t3. For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n\t\t- If the neighbor is not yet visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it into Q.\n5.
