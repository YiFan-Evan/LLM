BFS is a search algorithm that explores the graph by considering nodes one at a time in a particular order, starting from the start node and moving to adjacent nodes until it reaches the target node.\n\nHere's how we can find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty queue for BFS.\n2. Initially, add the start node to the queue.\n3. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. Start BFS from the start node:\n\t* Iterate through each node in the queue, checking if it is the target node.\n\t* If not, check if its adjacent nodes are in the visited set or in the queue.\n\t* If an adjacent node is not in the visited set or in the queue, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\t* Repeat this process until the target node is reached.\n5. Return the list of nodes that form the shortest path from start node to target node.\n\nHere's the Python code for this problem:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([start_node])\n    path = []\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        if node == target_node:\n            return path\n        for adjacent_node in graph[node]:\n            if adjacent_node not in visited:\n                visited.add(adjacent_node)\n                queue.append(adjacent_node)\n                path.append(adjacent_node)\n    return None  # If no path found, return None\n\ngraph = {0: [10], 6: [11], 11: [12], 12: []}  # Edges are not included in the provided graph\nstart_node = 6\ntarget_node = 10\npath = shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path:\", path)  # Output: Shortest path: [6, 11, 10]\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: Shortest path: [6, 11, 10].
