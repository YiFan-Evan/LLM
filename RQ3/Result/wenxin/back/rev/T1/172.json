It works by maintaining a priority queue, where the priority of each node is its distance from the start node. The algorithm iteratively removes the node with the smallest distance from the start node and expands its neighbors.\n\nHere's how we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 12 in the provided graph:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Graph represented as adjacency list\ngraph = {\n    0: [9],  #

Set to keep track of visited nodes\npath = []  # Path to store the shortest path from start node to destination node\n\nwhile pq:\n    current_node, distance = heapq.heappop(pq)  # Pop the node with the smallest distance from start node\n    if current_node == destination:  # If we've reached the destination node, break\n        break\n    visited.add(current_node)  # Mark current node as visited\n    for neighbor in graph[current_node]:  # Iterate through all neighbors of current node\n        if neighbor not in visited:  # If the neighbor hasn't been visited yet\n            next_distance = distance + graph[current_node][neighbor]  # Calculate the new distance to the neighbor\n            if next_distance < graph[neighbor]:  # If the new distance is less than the old distance, update it\n                graph[neighbor] = next_distance\n                heapq.heappush(pq, (next_distance, neighbor))  # Push the new neighbor back into the priority queue\n    path.append(current_node)  #
