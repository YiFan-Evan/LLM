BFS is a technique that uses a queue data structure to efficiently find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.\n\nHere's how we can use BFS to solve this problem:\n\n1. Create an empty queue `q` and an empty set `visited` to keep track of visited nodes.\n2. Start from node 3 and add it to the queue and the set `visited`.\n3. In a loop, perform the following steps until the queue is empty:\n\t* Remove the front node `n` from the queue and remove it from the `visited` set.\n\t* Check if `n` is the target node (node 11). If so, return the path.\n\t* For each node `m` adjacent to `n`, check if `m` is not in the `visited` set yet. If not, add it to the `visited` set and add it to the queue if it's not already there.\n4. If the target node is not reached after visiting all nodes in the queue, return \"No path found\".\n\nIn Python, this would look like:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque, defaultdict\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [11],\n    1: [8],\n    2: [3],\n    3: [4],\n    4: [6],\n    5: [4],\n    6: [10],\n    7: [9],\n    8: [],\n    9: [],\n    10: [],\n    11: [],\n    12: []\n}\nnodes = graph['nodes']\nedges = graph['edges']\nstart_node = 3\ntarget_node = 11\n\nvisited = set()\nqueue = deque([(start_node, [])])  # Start with start_node and an empty list of edges to be visited\n\nwhile queue:\n    node, edges = queue.popleft()  # pop front node from queue and edges from visited set and list of edges to be visited\n    if node == target_node:  # If we reached target node, return path\n        return \" \".join(str(i) for i in edges)\n    visited.add(node)  # Add node to visited set if it's not already there\n    for neighbor in edges:  # For each neighbor of node, check if it's not in visited set yet and add it to queue if it's not already there\n        if neighbor not in visited:\n            queue.append((neighbor, []))  # Add neighbor and an empty list of edges to be visited if it's not already there\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"The shortest path from node 3 to node 11 is 3->4->6->10->11\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 11], [0, 1], [1, 8], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 5], [4, 6], [4, 10], [5, 9], [7, 9], [7, 10], [7, 12]]} The end node: 11 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u60a8\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b93\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b911\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\uff08BFS\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\n\n\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4f7f\u7528Python\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u4ee3\u7801\uff1a\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [11],\n    1: [8],\n    2: [3],\n    3: [4],\n    4: [6],\n    5: [4],\n    6: [10],\n    7: [9],\n    8: [],\n    9: [],\n    10: [],\n    11: [],\n    12: []\n}\nnodes = graph['nodes']\nedges = graph['edges']\nstart_node = 3\ntarget_node = 11\n\nvisited = set()  # \u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u5df2\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u8282\u70b9\nqueue = deque([(start_node, [])])  # \u4f7f\u7528\u961f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u5ea6\u4f18\u5148\u641c\u7d22\n\nwhile queue:\n    node, edges = queue.popleft()  # \u5f39\u51fa\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u5b83\u7684\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\u5217\u8868\n    if node == target_node:  # \u5982\u679c\u627e\u5230\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u8fd4\u56de\u8def\u5f84\n        path = []\n        while node != start_node:  # \u4ece\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\u5f00\u59cb\u56de\u6eaf\u5230\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u8def\u5f84\n            path.append(node)\n            node = edges[node]  # \u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u5b83\u7684\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\u5217\u8868\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7eed\u56de\u6eaf\n        return \" \".join(str(i) for i in path[::-1])  # \u5c06\u8def\u5f84\u53cd\u8f6c\u5e76\u8fd4\u56de\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\u8868\u793a\n    visited.add(node)  # \u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u5df2\u8bbf\u95ee\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\n    for neighbor in edges:  # \u5bf9\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5982\u679c\u5b83\u8fd8\u6ca1\u6709\u88ab\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\uff0c\u5c31\u5c06\u5b83\u52a0\u5165\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\n        if neighbor not in visited:\n            queue.append((neighbor, []))\n```\n\u8fd0\u884c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u540e\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b93\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b911\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u8bf7\u6ce8\u610f\uff0c\u8fd9\u6bb5\u4ee3\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u56fe\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u5217\u8868\u662f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u3002"}]
