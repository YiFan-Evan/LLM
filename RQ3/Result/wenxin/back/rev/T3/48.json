Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given node and explores all the adjacent nodes in a breadth-first manner until it reaches the target node.\n2. Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is similar to BFS, but it uses a priority queue to efficiently find the shortest path between two nodes.\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing BFS, we can find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 as follows:\n\n1. Start from node 5.\n2. Create an empty queue Q.\n3. Add node 5 to queue Q.\n4. While queue Q is not empty:\n\t1. Extract the first node from queue Q (let's call it current_node).\n\t2. For each adjacent node of current_node (in the given graph, there are only three adjacent nodes for each node):\n\t\t- If the distance from current_node to adjacent node is less than the distance to adjacent node so far, update the distance and add adjacent node to queue Q if it's not already there.\n5. The shortest path from node 5 to node 4 is found in queue Q. Now we can simply follow the edges in the reverse direction to get from node 4 to node 5.
