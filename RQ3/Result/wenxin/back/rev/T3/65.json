However, because you provided a list of nodes and edges in the graph, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path.\n\nBFS works by initially starting from the starting node and progressively exploring neighboring nodes until it reaches the target node. It then continues exploring neighboring nodes in the same way until it reaches the target node or has explored all nodes in the graph.\n\nHere's how you can use BFS to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 6:\n\n1. Create an empty set or list to store the visited nodes. Initially, all nodes are unvisited.\n2. Set the starting node (node 4) as visited.\n3. Use a queue (BFS uses a queue for this purpose) to store all unvisited nodes that are reachable from the starting node.\n4. While there are still unvisited nodes in the queue:\n\t* Remove the current node from the queue and add it to the visited set.\n\t* For each adjacent node of the current node that is not yet visited:\n\t\t+ Add it to the queue.\n5. After all nodes have been visited, the shortest path is the sequence of nodes in the visited set that lead from the starting node to the target node.\n\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 4 to node 6 is: 4 -> 3 -> 6.
