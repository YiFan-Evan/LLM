BFS is a greedy search algorithm that explores the graph in a breadth-first manner, starting from a given node and gradually exploring its neighbors.\n\nHere's how we can use BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Initialize a visited set V with all nodes in the graph.\n3. Initialize a path P with an empty list.\n4. Add node 3 to Q and V.\n5. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Remove the first node from Q (let's call it node x).\n\t2. If node x is equal to node 22, then we have found our shortest path. We can stop the search and return the path P.\n\t3. For each neighbor of node x that is not yet visited:\n\t\t- Add the neighbor to V (if it's not already in V).\n\t\t- Add the neighbor to Q (if it's not already in Q).\n\t\t- Append node x to the end of the path P (since we are moving to it).\n6. If no path was found by this point, return \"No path found\".\n\nThis algorithm will find the shortest path from node 3 to node 22 in the graph.
