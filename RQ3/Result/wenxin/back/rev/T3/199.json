Start with the starting node (node 5) and initialize a set of visited nodes to be empty.\n2. Iterate through all the edges in the graph starting from node 5. For each edge, check if the destination node is in the set of visited nodes. If it is not, add the edge to the set of visited edges and update the distance to the destination node using the minimum distance among all edges that lead to the destination node.\n3. Repeat step 2 until all nodes in the graph have been visited.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the given graph and find the shortest path from node 5 to node 7:\n\n1. Start with node 5 and initialize a set of visited nodes to be empty.\n2.
