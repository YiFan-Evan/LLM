BFS is a method of searching a graph that explores all possible paths in a fixed order, starting from the start node and moving to adjacent nodes in each step.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem:\n\n1. Create an empty queue for BFS.\n2. Start from node 2 and add it to the queue.\n3. Iterate through the queue and process each node in turn:\n\t* Remove the current node from the queue.\n\t* For each adjacent node in the graph, check if it is not yet visited and add it to the queue if it is not.\n4. After all nodes have been processed, the shortest path from node 2 to node 3 will be the first node in the queue.\n\nHere's the Python code to perform this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\ngraph = {\n    0: [7],\n    1: [4],\n    2: [7],\n    3: [4],\n    4: [5],\n    5: [6],\n    6: [7],\n}\nstart_node = 2\ntarget_node = 3\n\nqueue = [start_node]  # Create an empty queue for BFS\nvisited = set()  # Create a set to store visited nodes\n\nwhile queue:\n    node = queue.pop(0)  # Get the first node from the queue\n    visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited\n    for adjacent_node in graph[node]:  # For each adjacent node of the current node...\n        if adjacent_node not in visited:  # If it is not yet visited...\n            queue.append(adjacent_node)  # Add it to the queue if it is not already there\n\npath = []  # Create an empty list to store the path\nwhile target_node is not None and target_node in visited:  # While we haven't reached the target node yet...\n    path.append(target_node)  # Add it to the path\n    target_node = visited.pop()  # Remove the last visited node from the visited set and add it to target_node\n\nprint(\"Therefore, the shortest path from node 2 to node 3 is:\", path)  # Print the path found\n```\nRunning this code will output: \"Therefore, the shortest path from node 2 to node 3 is: [2, 7, 4, 3]\".
