These include:\n\n1. Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is commonly used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It is suitable for sparse, weighted, directed graphs.\n\n2. Depth-first search: We need to use a depth-first search approach to traverse the graph starting from node 3 to find the shortest path to node 13.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe shortest path from node 3 to node 13 in the given graph is: 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 14 -> 13.\n\nTo find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm, we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Initialize a set of nodes called 'visited' and set it to include node 3 only.\n2. Create a dictionary or set to keep track of the shortest distance from node 3 to reach each node. Initially, all distances are set to infinity (or a very large number).\n3. Create a queue called 'priority queue' for Dijkstra's algorithm to keep track of nodes with the shortest distance from node 3.\n4. Iterate through the nodes in the 'visited' set until all nodes are visited.\n5. In each iteration, take the node with the smallest distance from node 3 from the priority queue and add its neighboring nodes to the 'visited' set if they are not already visited.\n6. Update the distance for all nodes that have been added to 'visited' by considering the edge weights in the graph and keep track of the shortest distance for each node in the priority queue.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until all nodes in the graph have been visited.\n8. Finally, the shortest path from node 3 to node 13 is the shortest distance that is maintained in the priority queue after completion of the algorithm.\n\nNote: Dijkstra's algorithm assumes that there are no cycles in the graph.
