Initialize a set of nodes that have already been visited (set to contain only node 3).\n2. Initialize a set of nodes that have not yet been visited (set to contain all nodes except node 3).\n3. Initialize a priority queue (priority queue can be any data structure that allows quick access to elements with the smallest priority). The priority queue should be filled with the nodes that are not yet visited, and their priority should be their distance from node 3.\n4. Start with step 5.\n5.
