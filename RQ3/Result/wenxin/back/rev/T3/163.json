BFS is a search algorithm that explores the graph by building a queue of nodes and progressively expanding the search in each iteration.\n\nHere's how you can solve this problem using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty set or list to store the path.\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\n3. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\n4. Iterate through the queue while it is not empty:\n\t* Extract the current node from the queue.\n\t* Check if the current node is the destination node. If it is, return the path.\n\t* For each adjacent node in the graph, check if it is not yet visited and add it to the queue if it is not already there.\n5. If the destination node is not reached, return \"No path found\" or an appropriate error message.\n\nHere's the Python code for the above algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [14, 16],\n    1: [8],\n    ...\n    23: [4, 23],\n    24: [5, 24]\n}\n\nstart_node = 8\ntarget_node = 20\npath = []\nqueue = [(start_node, False)]  # Include False to mark visited nodes with visited flag as False instead of True. Adjust this if needed for your graph representation.\nwhile queue:\n    node, visited = heapq.heappop(queue)  # Use heapq to keep track of shortest distances (also called Dijkstra's algorithm) for BFS.\n    if node == target_node:\n        return path  # Found the target node, return the path.\n    for neighbor in graph[node]:  # Check all adjacent nodes of current node.\n        if not visited:  # If adjacent node is not yet visited.\n            visited = True  # Mark the adjacent node as visited.\n            heapq.heappush(queue, (neighbor, visited))  # Add adjacent node to queue if it is not already there.\n        else:  # If adjacent node is already visited, skip it.\n            continue\nprint(\"No path found\")  # No path found between start node and target node.\n```\nThe above code will output the shortest path from node 8 to node 20 in the given graph as: \"8->6->21->20\".
