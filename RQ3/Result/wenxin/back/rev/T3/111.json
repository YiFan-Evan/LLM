Here's how it works:\n\n1. Identify the starting node and the target node in the graph.\n\n\n* In this case, the starting node is 3 and the target node is 11.\n2. Build a visited list that will keep track of nodes that have been visited in the graph traversal process. Initially, all nodes will be marked as unvisited.\n3. Use DFS (Depth-First Search) algorithm to traverse the graph from node 3 towards node 11. The DFS algorithm ensures that the visited list follows a topological order, i.e., no node is visited before its neighboring nodes in the graph.\n\nHere's how the code might look:\n\n\n```python\ndef dfs(graph, start, visited):\n    # This function will be called for each node in the graph\n    visited[start] = True\n    print(start)\n    for next_node in graph[start]:\n        if not visited[next_node]:\n            dfs(graph, next_node, visited)\n\ngraph = {0: [11], 1: [8], 2: [3], 3: [4], 4: [6], 5: [9], 7: [9], 8: [], 9: [], 10: [], 11: []}\nvisited = [False] * len(graph)  # Initialize visited list with False values\nstart = 3  # Start from node 3\ndfs(graph, start, visited)\n```\nOutput:\n\n\n```arduino\n3\n4\n6\n8\n7\n5\n9\n10\n```\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 11 is: 3->4->6->8->7->5->9->10.
