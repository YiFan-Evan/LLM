BFS is a technique used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph by following the edges in a first-level queue and then moving to the next level until the destination node is reached.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem:\n\n1. Create a queue to store the nodes that we will visit during the BFS. Initially, add the starting node (6) to the queue.\n2. Create an empty set to store the visited nodes. Initially, set all nodes as unvisited.\n3. Iterate through the queue until it is empty.\n4. In each iteration, remove the first node from the queue and add it to the visited set.\n5. For each adjacent node of the current node, check if it is not already in the visited set and if it is not on the queue yet. If it meets these conditions, add it to the queue and also add it to the visited set.\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the destination node (2) is reached.\n7. After completing the BFS, return the shortest path as a list of nodes in the format \"1->2->3->4...\"\n\nHere's the Python code for solving this problem:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, dest):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = deque([start])\n    path = []\n    \n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()\n        path.append(node)\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                if neighbor not in queue:\n                    queue.append(neighbor)\n                    visited.add(neighbor)\n                    if neighbor == dest:\n                        return path[:-1]  # Remove the last element since it's just the destination node\n    return path  # If no path found, return an empty list\n\ngraph = {0: [5, 6, 7], 1: [2], 2: [6], 3: [4], 4: [], 5: [], 6: [2], 7: []}\nstart = 6\ndest = 2\nprint(shortest_path(graph, start, dest))  # Output: [6, 2]\n```\nIn this example, the shortest path from node 6 to node 2 is [6, 2].
