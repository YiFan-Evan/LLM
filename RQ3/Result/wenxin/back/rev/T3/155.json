Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is commonly used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It is based on the idea of assigning a priority queue containing nodes that have not yet been visited and assigning a distance to each node.\n\n2. Edge traversal: We need to follow the edges to get from one node to another.\n\nHere's the solution:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the priority queue with the starting node (node 0).\n\nStep 2: Assign a distance of infinity to all nodes except the starting node (node 0).\n\nStep 3: Update the distance of the nodes in the priority queue based on the edges and the assigned distance. If the new distance is less than the distance to its neighbors, update it.\n\nStep 4: Repeat step 3 until the priority queue is empty or no further changes are made to any of the distances.\n\nStep 5: Since we want to reach node 4, keep traversing the edges until we reach node 4 or reach a node that has already been visited.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 0 to node 4 is: 0->5->7->4.
