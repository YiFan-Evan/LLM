The starting node is 8, and the target node is 1.\n\nNext, we need to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 1. To do this, we need to follow the edges in the graph starting from node 8 and check if each edge leads us closer to the target node 1.\n\nIn this graph, there are several possible paths from node 8 to node 1. The shortest path would be the path that uses fewer edges.\n\nHere's how we can find the shortest path:\n\nStep 1: Find the path with fewer edges: This can be done by traversing the graph starting from node 8 in a breadth-first search (BFS) manner until reaching node 1. The BFS ensures that we check all nodes that are closer to the target node first before moving on to more distant nodes.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the shortest path length: Once we have found the shortest path, we can calculate its length by counting the number of edges it traverses. In this case, the shortest path from node 8 to node 1 is 4 edges long (edges [0, 9], [3, 7], [6, 8], and [6, 11]).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 8 to node 1 is [node 8] -> [node 9] -> [node 7] -> [node 8] -> [node 11] -> [node 1].
