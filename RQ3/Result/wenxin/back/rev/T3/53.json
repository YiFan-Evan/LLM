Since it's the starting node, it doesn't have any edges leading to other nodes. Therefore, the shortest path from node 6 to any other node is an edge directly connecting them.\n\nStep 2: Go to node 5, which is connected to node 6 by an edge. This is the next node in the shortest path.\n\nStep 3: Go to node 1, which is connected to node 5 by an edge. Since we have reached the target node, the shortest path from node 6 to node 1 is now: 6->5->1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->5->1.
