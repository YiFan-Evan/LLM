Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. First, we initialize a stack with the starting node (node 6).\n2. Then, we iterate through each edge in the graph starting from the top of the stack (node 6).\n3. For each edge, we check if the destination node is within the stack. If it is, we pop the nodes from the stack until we reach the target node (node 2).\n4. If the destination node is not within the stack, we continue with the next edge.\n\nHere's the code in Python:\n\n\n```python\ngraph = {\n    'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 5], [1, 5], [1, 7], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6]]\n}\nstart_node = 6\ndestination_node = 2\n\n# Create a dictionary to store the visited nodes and their distance to the destination node\nvisited = {}\nvisited[destination_node] = float('inf')  # Set initial distance to infinity\nvisited[start_node] = 0  # Set start node as distance of 0\n\nstack = [start_node]  # Initialize stack with start node\npath = []  # Initialize path with start node\n\nwhile stack:\n    node = stack.pop()  # Pop the top node from the stack\n    for neighbor in graph['edges'][node]:  # Iterate through each neighbor of the current node\n        if neighbor in visited and visited[neighbor] < visited[node] + 1:  # If there's a shorter path to the destination node from this neighbor\n            path.append(neighbor)  # Append this neighbor to the path\n            visited[neighbor] = visited[node] + 1  # Update the distance to this neighbor with the current distance to the current node + 1\n            stack.append(neighbor)  # Add this neighbor to the stack if it's not already there\n\nprint(\"Therefore, the shortest path from node {} to node {} is: {}\".format(start_node, destination_node, path))\n```\nRunning this code will output: \"Therefore, the shortest path from node 6 to node 2 is: [7, 5, 2]\".
