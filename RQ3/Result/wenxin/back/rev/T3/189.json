It repeatedly removes the \"worst\" node from the priority queue and moves its neighbors to the queue, updating their distances to the target node if necessary.\n* To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest path from node 20 to node 1. Therefore, we need to initialize the priority queue with the distances from node 20 to all other nodes in the graph.\n* We also need to keep track of the nodes that have been visited so far to avoid visiting the same node multiple times.\n\nSolution:\n\nAlgorithm steps:\n\n1. Initialize a priority queue with all nodes in the graph (except for node 1) with their distances to node 20. Set the distance to \u221e for nodes that cannot be reached directly from node 20 (i.e., nodes not in the graph).\n2. Initialize visited nodes as an empty set.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n\t* Remove the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\n\t* If the removed node is not in the visited set, mark it as visited and add its neighbors to the visited set if they are not already visited.\n\t* Update the distances of neighbors of the removed node if necessary (i.e., if their distance to node 1 is shorter than before).\n4. Return the list of nodes in the shortest path from node 20 to node 1.\n\nCode in Python:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# ...\n# graph initialized as a dictionary with edges...\ngraph = {i: set(edges[i]) for i, edges in enumerate(edges)}  # remove this part for shorter code\n\ndistances = {i: float('inf') for i in nodes}  # initialize distances as infinity for non-reachable nodes\ndistances[start_node] = 0  # distance from start node to itself is 0\nheap = [(0, start_node)]  # priority queue with distances and nodes\nvisited = set()  # visited nodes\n\nwhile heap:\n    (dist, node) = heapq.heappop(heap)  # remove (distance, node) pair from priority queue\n    if node not in visited:  # if node is not visited yet...\n        visited.add(node)  # mark it as visited\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # add neighbors of current node to visited set if not already visited...\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (dist + 1, neighbor))  # and add them to priority queue if they are closer than before...\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # update distances of neighbors if necessary...\n            for parent in graph[neighbor]:  # (assume edges have parent->child format)\n                if parent in visited and dist + 1 > distances[parent]:  # if parent was reached from child via current node...\n                    distances[parent] = dist + 1  # update parent's distance to child with new value\n                    heapq.heappush(heap, (dist + 1, parent))  # and add it back to priority queue if it's closer than before\n                    break  # no need to check other parents for this neighbor, they are all covered by this one now\n        if distances[node] < distances[target_node]:  # if new shortest path was found...\n            shortest_path = []  # initialize shortest path list...\n            while node != target_node:  # go through nodes until reaching target_node...\n                shortest_path.append(node)  # append each node to shortest path list...\n                node = distances[node] - 1  # move to next node in shortest path list...\n            return shortest_path  # return shortest path list as answer...\n```\nThis code assumes that each edge is represented by a parent->child format.
