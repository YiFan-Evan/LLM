The starting node is 6, and the destination node is 10. We need to find the shortest path between these two nodes.\n2. Each edge in the graph represents a relationship between two nodes. In this case, we have edges between nodes 2-8, 2-5, 3-6, 4-5, 4-6, 5-9, 6-14, 7-11, 7-9, 8-13, and 10-12, where each edge has a distance value associated with it.\n3. The shortest path is the path that has the smallest distance value between any pair of nodes.\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the shortest path from node 6 to node 10. Here's the algorithm in pseudocode:\n\n\n```less\ninitialize a priority queue Q with start node\ninitialize a set/list visited with start node\nwhile Q is not empty:\n    current_node = extract_min_element(Q)  # get the node with the smallest distance value from Q\n    if current_node is the destination node:\n        return the shortest path from start node to current_node\n    for each neighbor of current_node that is not in visited:\n        mark neighbor as visited\n        update the distance value of neighbor to current_node\n        add neighbor to Q if it is not already there\n```\nThe final answer is: `6->4->5->10`\n\nThis path has a distance of 4 from node 6 to node 10, which is the shortest possible distance."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 13], [1, 11], [2, 8], [2, 5], [3, 6], [4, 5], [4, 6], [5, 9], [6, 14], [7, 11], [7, 9], [8, 13], [10, 12], [10, 14]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 6 to node 5 in the given graph is `6->4->5`.
