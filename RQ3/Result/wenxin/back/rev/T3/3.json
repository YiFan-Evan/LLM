Start with node 4 as the current node.\n2. Find the shortest distance to node 5 from node 4 using the edges in the graph.\n3. If the distance is less than the current shortest distance to node 5, update the shortest distance and the path to node 5.\n4. Repeat step 2 for all nodes that are reachable from node 4 until we reach node 5.\n\nSolution:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 4 to node 5 is: 4->4->4->5.
