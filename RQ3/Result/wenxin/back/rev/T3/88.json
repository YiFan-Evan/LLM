Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given node and explores all the adjacent nodes in a given depth before moving to the next level of nodes.\n2. Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is similar to BFS, but it uses a priority queue to efficiently find the shortest path between two nodes. It is more suitable for large graphs with many nodes and edges.\n\nSolution:\n\nUsing BFS algorithm, we can find the shortest path from node 6 to node 10 as follows:\n\n1. Start from node 6 and mark it as visited.\n2. Create an empty queue Q and add node 6 to it.\n3. Create an empty set P to keep track of visited nodes.\n4. While Q is not empty:\n\t1. Extract the smallest element x from Q (this is called \"explore\").\n\t2. If x is the destination node (node 10), then return from the while loop with x and its adjacent nodes added to P as well as their respective shortest paths from x to P, storing these values in the \"ShortestPath\" list, or append them if they have already been stored (which means we found the shortest path to this destination node).\n\t3. For each neighbor of x that is not yet visited, mark it as visited and add it to P (and Q if it was not yet in Q).\n5. If we reached node 10 after following all adjacent nodes in step 4 without returning, then it means that there is no path from node 6 to node 10 and we return None.\n\nCode in Python:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes.\n    queue = [(0, start_node)]  # Queue for BFS algorithm.\n    shortest_path = []  # List to store shortest path and its distances.\n    \n    while queue:\n        cost, node = heapq.heappop(queue)  # Extract smallest element from queue.\n        if node == target_node:  # Found the target node?\n            shortest_path = [(node, cost)] + shortest_path  # Add path and its distance to shortest_path list.\n            break  # No need to explore other nodes anymore since we have found the shortest path.\n        visited.add(node)  # Mark the node as visited.\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # Explore each neighbor of current node that is not yet visited.\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # Add the neighbor to queue and visited sets if not yet there.\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (cost + 1, neighbor))  # Add new node with cost of current node plus 1 to queue (this represents a new edge in graph).\n                visited.add(neighbor)  # Add new node to visited set as well.\n    if not shortest_path:  # If we didn't find the target node after exploring all adjacent nodes, return None or error message if needed.\n        return None\n    return shortest_path  #
