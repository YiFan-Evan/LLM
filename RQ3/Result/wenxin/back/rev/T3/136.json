BFS is a search algorithm that explores the graph by considering nodes one at a time in a particular order.\n\nHere's how you can find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty queue for BFS.\n2. Start from node 6 and add it to the queue.\n3. Iterate through the queue, popping nodes one by one and updating the distance from the start node to the popped node.\n4.
