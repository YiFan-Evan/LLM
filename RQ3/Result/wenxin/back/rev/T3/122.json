These include:\n\n1. Dijkstra's algorithm: This is a well-known algorithm for finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It works by assigning a priority queue to nodes in the graph and keeping track of their distance to the destination.\n\nHere's how you can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path:\n\nStep 1: Set up a priority queue to keep track of the distances between nodes and the destination. Also, initialize all distances to infinity (except for the starting node, which can be set to zero).\n\nStep 2: Select the node with the smallest distance from the start node. Since node 8 has the smallest distance from start node, select node 8 as your current node.\n\nStep 3: Add the edges connecting the current node to other nodes to your priority queue, but only if there is no path between the current node and the destination that is shorter than the distance you are considering.\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you reach node 12 or there are no more nodes to add to the priority queue.\n\nNow that you have followed these principles, you can use them to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 12 using Dijkstra's algorithm.
