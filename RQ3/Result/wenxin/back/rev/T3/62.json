Initialize the distance array with all nodes set to infinity except for the start node, which is set to 0. Also initialize the predecessor array with all nodes set to None.\n2. Iterate over all nodes that have unvisited neighbors with distances smaller than the distance of their predecessor. For each such node, update the distance and predecessor arrays.\n3. Repeat step 2 until all nodes have been visited at least once and the distance array has been updated.\n4.
