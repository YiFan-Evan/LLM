It works by maintaining a priority queue, where the priority of each node is its distance from the target node. The algorithm iteratively removes the node with the smallest distance from the target node and updates the distances of its neighbors based on their distance from the removed node.\n\nHere's how we can implement Dijkstra's algorithm in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start, end):\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    queue = [(0, start)]\n    \n    while queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n            continue\n        for neighbor, edge_distance in graph[current_node].items():\n            distance = current_distance + edge_distance\n            if distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = distance\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))\n    \n    return distances\n\ngraph = {\n    0: {3: 2},\n    1: {2: 1},\n    2: {4: 3},\n    3: {},\n    4: {5: 2},\n    5: {},\n    6: {7: 3},\n    7: {}\n}\n\nstart = 0\nend = 3\ndistances = dijkstra(graph, start, end)\nprint(\"Shortest path:\", end)\nfor node in sorted(distances):\n    print(\"->\", node)\n```\nOutput:\n\n```makefile\nShortest path: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3\n```\n\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b57\u5178 `distances`\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b58\u50a8\u4ece\u8d77\u70b9\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u7136\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5148\u961f\u5217 `queue`\uff0c\u5c06\u8d77\u70b9\u52a0\u5165\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u8ddd\u79bb\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a0\u3002\u63a5\u4e0b\u6765\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u4e0d\u65ad\u4ece\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u53d6\u51fa\u8ddd\u79bb\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u5176\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u5982\u679c\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5c0f\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u5c06\u5176\u52a0\u5165\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u8fd4\u56de `distances` \u5b57\u5178\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u4ece\u8d77\u70b9\u5230\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4f8b\u5b50\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u662f\u4ece\u8282\u70b90\u5230\u8282\u70b93\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 6], [2, 4], [3, 5], [6, 7]]} The start node: 0 The destination:  4 "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u6839\u636e\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff1a\n\n0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 4\n\n\u8fd9\u662f\u6700\u77ed\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u603b\u5171\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e86\u56db\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8def\u5f84\u662f\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b90\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8282\u70b91\u30012\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b94\u3002"}]
