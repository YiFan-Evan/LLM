Start with the starting node (20) and initialize a set of visited nodes to be empty.\n2. Iterate through all the edges in the graph, starting from the starting node (20).\n3. For each edge, check if the destination node is the node we are trying to reach (9). If it is, add the edge to the shortest path and also mark the destination node as visited.\n4. If you encounter a node that is already visited, you can skip it and move on to the next edge.\n\nImplementation of the algorithm:\n\nPython code in pseudocode:\n\n\n```python\ninitialize shortest_path as an empty list\ninitialize visited_nodes as an empty set\nadd start_node (20) to visited_nodes\n\nfor each edge in edges:\n    if destination_node (the other end of the edge) is in visited_nodes:\n        continue\n    add edge to shortest_path\n    mark destination_node as visited\n    update shortest_path based on the edge weight (the distance between the nodes)\n\nreturn shortest_path\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 20 to node 9 is 20->21->9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 22], [1, 14], [1, 4], [1, 2], [2, 11], [3, 13], [4, 13], [4, 21], [4, 22], [5, 11], [6, 10], [7, 16], [7, 14], [8, 16], [9, 10], [9, 17], [11, 23], [11, 24], [12, 19], [12, 21], [14, 15], [16, 17], [18, 23], [20, 21]]} The start node: 20 The destination: 21"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 20 to node 21 in the provided graph is: 20->22->21."}]
