Define the starting node and the destination node.\n2. Define the graph structure by creating a set of nodes and edges.\n3. Initialize a priority queue with the starting node and set its priority to 0.\n4. Iterate through the nodes in the priority queue, updating their distances to the destination node based on the shortest path so far.\n5. When a node has no more adjacent nodes with shorter distances, remove it from the priority queue and continue with the next node.\n6. After all nodes have been processed, the shortest path is the sequence of nodes in the priority queue that were removed last.\n\nSolution:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2->4\n\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 3 is 1->2->4, which involves 3 edges and has a length of 4 units."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 1 to node 2 in the given graph is 1->2.
