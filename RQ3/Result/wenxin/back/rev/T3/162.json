Initialize a set of visited nodes and a priority queue (for storing nodes with the shortest distances).\n2. Set the distance of the starting node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.\n3. Add the starting node to the visited set.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n\t- Extract the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\n\t- Remove it from the queue.\n\t- For each node adjacent to the extracted node:\n\t\t- If the distance from the extracted node to the adjacent node is lower than the distance from the adjacent node to its target, update the distance of the adjacent node.\n\t- If the extracted node is the target node, return its path.\n5. If no path was found from the starting node to the target node, return \"No path found\".\n\nHere's how we can implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    visited = set()\n    queue = [(0, start)]\n    path = []\n    while queue:\n        (dist, node) = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        if node == end:\n            path = [node] + path\n            break\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                visited.add(neighbor)\n                new_dist = dist + 1\n                if new_dist < graph[node][neighbor]:\n                    graph[node][neighbor] = new_dist\n                    heapq.heappush(queue, (new_dist, neighbor))\n    if path == []:\n        return \"No path found\"\n    return \" \".join(str(i) for i in reversed(path))\n```\nIn this code, `graph` is your provided graph as an adjacency matrix, `start` is the starting node, and `end` is the target node. The function returns a string representing the shortest path from the starting node to the target node. If no path was found, it returns \"No path found\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: ```shortest_path``` 23->7->4->22 ```shortest_path```."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 11], [1, 3], [3, 22], [3, 7], [4, 16], [4, 11], [4, 21], [5, 21], [5, 15], [6, 7], [6, 8], [8, 18], [8, 11], [9, 20], [10, 21], [12, 15], [13, 17], [14, 20], [14, 24], [15, 20], [17, 21], [19, 21], [20, 23]]} The start node: 23 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 23 to node 4 in the provided graph is:\n\n```\n23 -> 7 -> 4\n```\n\nThis path has a total length of 3, which is the shortest possible path from node 23 to node 4.
