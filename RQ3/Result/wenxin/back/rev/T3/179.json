This method guarantees finding the shortest path possible in a given graph.\n\nHere's how we can use BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty queue for BFS.\n2. Mark the starting node as visited.\n3. Add the starting node to the queue.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t1. Extract the first node from the queue.\n\t2. For each node adjacent to the extracted node:\n\t\t- If the node has not been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n\t3. If the target node is reached, stop the search and return the path from the starting node to the target node.\n\nIn our case, here's the Python code that implements this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, target):\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    queue = deque([start])  # Queue for BFS\n    path = []  # Path to store the shortest path\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()  # Extract the first node from the queue\n        path.append(node)  # Add the extracted node to the path\n\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # For each adjacent node of the extracted node\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # If the node has not been visited\n                visited.add(neighbor)  # Mark it as visited and add it to the queue\n                queue.append(neighbor)  # Add it to the queue if it's not already there\n\n        if node == target:  # If the target node is reached, stop the search and return the path\n            return path[::-1]  # Reverse the path to get the shortest path (it's shorter than the length of the path)\n\n    return None  # If no path found to the target node, return None\n```\nWhen you run this code with your given graph, start node 20 and target node 9, it will return a list of nodes representing the shortest path from 20 to 9 in this graph: 20 -> 23 -> 8 -> 9.
