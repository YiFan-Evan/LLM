Initialize a set of visited nodes and a priority queue (for storing nodes with the shortest distances).\n2. Set the distance from start node 16 to 18 to infinity, and set the distance from start node to itself as 0.\n3. Add start node 16 to the priority queue with distance 0.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n\t- Extract the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\n\t- Remove the extracted node from the queue.\n\t- For each adjacent node of the extracted node:\n\t\t+ If the distance from the extracted node to the adjacent node is lower than the distance from the adjacent node to its target, update the distance and add the adjacent node to the priority queue.\n5.
