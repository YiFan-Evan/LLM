Start by considering the nodes in the graph that are adjacent to node 5.\n2. Once you have identified the adjacent nodes, follow the edges to reach the next node in the shortest possible path.\n3. Repeat this process until you reach node 6.\n\nSolution:\n\n1. The adjacent nodes of node 5 are nodes 6, 2, and 3.\n2. The shortest path from node 5 to node 6 is through node 2, which is connected to node 5 by an edge.\n3. Therefore, the shortest path from node 5 to node 6 is: 5->2->6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->2->6.
