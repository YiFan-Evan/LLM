Therefore, we can use a technique called \"shortest path problem\" to find the shortest path from any node to any other node.\n2. **Distance Estimation**: To find the shortest path, we need to estimate the distance between each pair of nodes. In this case, we have a starting node (1) and a destination node (2). We need to calculate the distance from node 1 to node 2 using the edges in the graph.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the given graph and find the shortest path from node 1 to node 2:\n\nStep 1: Initialize a variable `shortest_distance` with a very large number (e.g., 99999) to represent the current distance from node 1 to node 2.\n\nStep 2: Iterate through each node in the graph, starting from node 1. For each node, calculate the distance from node 1 to that node using the edges in the graph.\n\nStep 3: If the calculated distance is less than the current `shortest_distance`, update `shortest_distance` with the new value.\n\nStep 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all nodes have been visited.\n\nStep 5: The final `shortest_distance` will represent the shortest path from node 1 to node 2.\n\nAlgorithm implementation:\n\nPython code in pseudo-code:\n\n\n```python\n# Create a list to store shortest distances from node 1 to all other nodes\nshortest_distances = [99999] * len(nodes)\n\n# Initialize all distances to a large number (start with this)\nfor i in range(len(nodes)):\n    shortest_distances[i] = 99999\n    \n# The shortest distance will be stored here after we calculate it\ncurrent_shortest_distance = -1  # Assume initially there is no shortest path\n\n# Iterate through each node in the graph starting from node 1\nfor i in range(len(nodes)):\n    if i == 1:  # Skip node 1 for simplicity\n        continue\n    \n    # Calculate distance from node 1 to all other nodes using edges in graph\n    for j in range(len(nodes)):\n        if j != i:  # Skip self-loops (i.e., same node)\n            distance = calculate_distance(i, j)  # Calculate distance using graph edges here\n            if distance < shortest_distances[j]:  # Update shortest distance if necessary\n                shortest_distances[j] = distance\n                current_shortest_distance = j  # Update current shortest path if necessary\n                break  # No need to continue calculating distances for other nodes after finding a shorter path\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 1 to node 2 is `1->3->2`.
