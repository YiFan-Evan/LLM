However, Dijkstra's algorithm is generally considered to be more suitable for undirected graphs.\n\nIn Dijkstra's algorithm, we start from a given node and keep track of the nodes that have already been visited. We also keep track of the distance from the start node to each node. We then keep removing nodes from the set of unvisited nodes that have the shortest distance to the target node. This process continues until we reach the target node or there are no more nodes to visit.\n\nHere's how you can implement Dijkstra's algorithm for this problem:\n\n1. Initialize the distance array with all zeros, except for the starting node (node 5) with a distance of infinity.\n2. Initialize a set of visited nodes with an empty set.\n3. Iterate over all nodes in the graph that are not yet visited:\n\t* If the distance from the current node to the target node is smaller than the distance in the distance array for any node, update the distance for all nodes that are reachable from the current node.\n\t* Remove all nodes that have a distance of infinity from the set of unvisited nodes.\n4. After all nodes have been visited, return the shortest distance from the starting node to the target node.\n\nHere's the Python code for implementing Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    # Initialize distance array and visited set\n    distance = [float('inf')] * len(graph['nodes'])\n    visited = set()\n    \n    # Update distance for all nodes reachable from start node\n    for edge in graph['edges']:\n        start_node, destination = edge[0], edge[1]\n        if start_node in visited and destination in visited:\n            distance[destination] = distance[start_node] + graph['edges'][edge]\n    \n    # Main loop to find shortest path from start node to target node\n    while len(visited) != 0:\n        # Get node with smallest distance to target node that is not yet visited\n        min_distance = float('inf')\n        current_node = None\n        for node in graph['nodes']:\n            if node not in visited and distance[node] < min_distance:\n                current_node = node\n                min_distance = distance[node]\n        \n        # Remove current node from visited set and update distances for all its neighbors that are not yet visited\n        visited.remove(current_node)\n        for edge in graph['edges']:\n            node1, node2 = edge\n            if node1 == current_node and node2 not in visited:\n                new_distance = distance[current_node] + graph['edges'][edge]\n                if new_distance < distance[node2]:\n                    distance[node2] = new_distance\n                    heapq.heappush(visited, node2)  # Update visited set with new neighbors that are now reachable from current node\n                    break  # No need to update distances for other neighbors of current node as they have already been processed during initialization step above\n    return distance[target_node]  # Return shortest distance from start node to target node\n```\nNow you can use this function to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 1 in the given graph:\n\n```python\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 6], [0, 7], [2, 4], [3, 4], [3, 7], [5, 6]]}\nstart_node = 5\ntarget_node = 1\nshortest_path = dijkstra(graph, start_node, target_node)\nprint(\"Shortest path:\", shortest_path)  #
