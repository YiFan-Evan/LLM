Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. Start from the starting node, 7.\n2. Follow the edge from node 7 to node 8.\n3. If we reach a node that is already visited, we can stop and return the path we have followed so far.\n4. Otherwise, we need to continue following edges until we reach a node that has a different adjacent node or we have reached the destination node.\n\nUsing these steps, here's how we can find the shortest path from node 7 to node 8:\n\n1. Follow edge 7->8, which takes us directly to the destination node 8. No other edge can lead to the destination from node 7.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->8\n\nNote: This is a single-node path from start to end. The shortest path could also include intermediate nodes along the way if there are any such nodes between start and end nodes that can be reached by following certain edges. In this case, there are no such nodes, so the shortest path is from start to end."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [1, 13], [2, 5], [2, 12], [2, 8], [3, 9], [4, 6], [4, 13], [6, 10], [7, 11], [7, 9], [8, 13], [9, 10], [13, 14]]} The start node: 7 The destination: 8, which takes us directly to the destination node 8.
