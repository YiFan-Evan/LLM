These algorithms will use the graph structure to find the shortest path between two nodes by considering the cost of each edge and the distance to the destination node.\n\nHere's how you can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 2:\n\n1. Initialize a priority queue with all the nodes in the graph.\n2. Set the distance to the destination node (in this case, node 2) to infinity and assign it a priority of 0.\n3. While there are still nodes in the priority queue:\n\t* Extract the node with the minimum priority from the queue.\n\t* Check if this node is the destination node (node 2). If it is, return the path from node 0 to node 2.\n\t* For each neighbor of this node:\n\t\t+ Calculate the new distance from this node to the destination node (distance = distance + cost of edge)\n\t\t+ If the new distance is less than the current distance, update the priority of this neighbor and add it back to the queue.\n4. If no path is found from node 0 to node 2, return an error or indicate that such a path does not exist.\n\nHere's how you can implement this algorithm in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, destination_node):\n    # Initialize priority queue with all nodes\n    nodes = [node for node in graph['nodes'] if node != destination_node]\n    heapq.heapify(nodes)\n\n    # Initialize distance and priority for each node\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph['nodes']}\n    distances[start_node] = 0\n    priorities = {node: distance for node, distance in distances.items()}\n\n    while len(nodes) > 0:\n        #
