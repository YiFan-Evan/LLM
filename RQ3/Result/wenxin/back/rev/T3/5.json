Initialize a set of nodes that have already been visited. Initially, only node 0 is visited.\n2. Initialize a priority queue with the nodes that have not been visited yet, along with their distances to the target node.\n3. Iterate over the priority queue until it is empty:\n\t* Extract the node with the smallest distance from the target node from the queue.\n\t* Mark this node as visited.\n\t* For each of its neighboring nodes that have not been visited yet:\n\t\t+ Calculate the new distance from this node to the target node by adding the distance to the extracted node and the edge weight between the extracted node and this neighboring node.\n\t\t+ If this new distance is lower than the distance of the neighboring node, update its distance and mark it as visited.\n4. The path from node 0 to node 6 is: 0 -> 3 -> 7 -> 6\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->3->7->6\n\nNote: The above algorithm assumes that the edge weights are non-negative.
