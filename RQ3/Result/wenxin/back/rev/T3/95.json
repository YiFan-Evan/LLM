Breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts from a given node and explores all the adjacent nodes in a given depth before moving to the next level of nodes.\n2. Recursive method: This method is used to efficiently find the shortest path between two nodes by recursively calling the BFS algorithm for each intermediate node.\n\nSolution:\n\n1.
