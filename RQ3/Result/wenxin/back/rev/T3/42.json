It iteratively chooses the vertex with the highest \"remaining cost\" and reduces its cost by one unit, thus reducing the shortest path from all vertices towards the chosen vertex.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a set of visited nodes (say, visited) and a cost map (say, dist) with all nodes having infinite cost initially.\n2. Initialize a priority queue with the starting node as the priority.\n3. Iterate over the priority queue until it is empty:\n\t* Remove the node with the minimum cost from the queue.\n\t* Mark it as visited.\n\t* For each adjacent node of the current node:\n\t\t+ If the adjacent node is not visited, update its cost to be the minimum of the current cost and the cost of the edge.\n\t\t+ Update the priority queue by increasing the priority of all adjacent nodes with cost equal to the edge cost or higher.\n4. Return the shortest path from node 4 to node 2.\n\nIn Python, this can be implemented like this:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, dest_node):\n    visited = set()\n    dist = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph['nodes']}\n    dist[start_node] = 0\n    priority_queue = [(0, start_node)]  # Cost of path and node together are added to make priority unique for Dijkstra algorithm\n    while priority_queue:\n        current_cost, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)\n        if current_node == dest_node:\n            return current_cost, visited  # If destination is reached, return path length and visited nodes\n        visited.add(current_node)\n        for neighbor in graph['nodes'][current_node]:\n            if neighbor not in visited:\n                new_cost = dist[current_node] + 1  # Cost of edge is 1 for each edge in graph\n                if new_cost < dist[neighbor]:  # If new cost is less than old cost, update new cost\n                    dist[neighbor] = new_cost\n                    heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (new_cost, neighbor))  # Update priority queue with new nodes and their costs\n    return None  # If destination is not reachable from start node, return None\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 4 to node 2 is 4->5->2 with a total cost of 3.
