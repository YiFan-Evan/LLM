Dijkstra's algorithm works by maintaining a set of nodes (known as the priority queue) and storing distances to each node. Initially, all distances are infinite except for the start node, which is set to 0.\n2. It then iteratively expands the set of nodes by considering the node with the smallest distance to the target node. It then updates the distances of all neighboring nodes of the current node to take into account the newly calculated distance.\n3. The process continues until reaching the target node or all nodes have been processed.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to our specific problem:\n\nStep 1: Initialize the priority queue with the start node (node 5) and set its distance to 0. Set all other nodes' distances to infinity.\n\nStep 2: Iteratively expand the priority queue by considering the node with the smallest distance to the target node (node 4). In this case, it's node 5.\n\nStep 3: For each of node 5's neighboring nodes (1, 2, 4), calculate their distances by adding the edge weights between node 5 and these neighboring nodes (0, 0, and infinity for nodes 1, 2, and 4 respectively). The distances of nodes 3 and 6 remain unchanged as they are not directly connected to node 5.\n\nStep 4: If the calculated distance for a neighboring node is smaller than its current distance, update its distance and add it to the priority queue. In this case, it's node 4 which becomes a neighboring node of node 5 after adding edge weights and thus needs to be updated to a shorter distance (which is also known as an improvement).\n\nStep 5: Continue until reaching node 4 or until there are no more nodes to process.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 5 to node 4 is: 5->3->4.
