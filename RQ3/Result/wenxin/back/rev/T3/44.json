BFS explores all the adjacent nodes in the graph at each iteration and selects the shortest path to the next node.\n\nHere's how you can find the shortest path:\n\n1. Start with node 6 as the starting node.\n2. Initialize a queue for BFS and add node 6 to the queue.\n3. Iterate through the queue while it is not empty.\n4.
