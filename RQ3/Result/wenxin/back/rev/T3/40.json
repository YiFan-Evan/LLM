Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. First, we initialize a stack with node 4 as the top of the stack. This will be our starting point.\n2. Then, we iterate through each edge in the graph. For each edge, we check if the start node is in the edge. If it is, we check if the target node is in the edge. If both conditions are true, we know that we can move from the start node to the target node along that edge.\n3.

Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. First, we initialize a queue with node 4 as the top of the queue. This will be our starting point.\n2. Then, we iterate through each node in the graph that is reachable from node 4. For each node, we add it to the queue and also add all its adjacent nodes to the queue if they are not already there.\n3. We keep track of the shortest distance to node 5 for each node in the queue. Initially, all distances are set to infinity.\n4. We start by setting the distance to node 5 to 0 for all nodes in the queue.\n5. Then, we iterate through the queue again and compare the distances to node 5 for each node in the queue with its current distance. If the distance has decreased, we update it.\n6.
