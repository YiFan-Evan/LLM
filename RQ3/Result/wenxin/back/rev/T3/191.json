BFS is a greedy search algorithm that explores the graph in a breadth-first manner, starting from the starting node and moving to adjacent nodes in order of their distance from the starting node.\n\nHere's how you can find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty queue Q for BFS.\n2. Initially, add the starting node 21 to Q.\n3. Create an empty set/list P to store the visited nodes.\n4. Initialize P with the starting node 21.\n5. Start BFS:\n\t* Iterate over Q until it becomes empty.\n\t* In each iteration, dequeue a node v from Q and check if v is the destination node 2. If v is the destination node, return P as the shortest path from 21 to 2.\n\t* For each neighbor u of v in the graph, check if u is not in P or Q and add u to P and Q if it is not already in P or Q.\n6. If no node in P is the destination node 2, return \"No path found\".\n\nHere's the Python code implementation for the above steps:\n\n\n```python\nimport queue\n\n# Define the graph\ngraph = {\n    0: [1, 13],\n    1: [2, 3],\n    2: [4, 5],\n    3: [6, 8, 12],\n    4: [7],\n    5: [8, 9, 21],\n    6: [10],\n    7: [14],\n    8: [11, 21],\n    9: [15],\n    10: [16],\n    ...\n}\n\n# Define start and destination nodes\nstart_node = 21\ndest_node = 2\n\n# Create a queue for BFS and initialize it with start node\nQ = queue.Queue()\nQ.put(start_node)\nvisited = set()  # Set to track visited nodes for BFS\nvisited.add(start_node)  # Add start node to visited set initially\n\n# Perform BFS until queue becomes empty or destination node is reached\nwhile not Q.empty():\n    node = Q.get()  # Dequeue a node from queue\n    if node == dest_node:  # If destination node is reached, return shortest path from start node to destination node\n        return list(visited)  # Convert set to list for printing shortest path in given format (1->2->3->4...)\n    for neighbor in graph[node]:  # Iterate over neighbors of current node and add to visited set and queue if not already visited/in queue and it is not part of current path from start node to destination node or not visited before (by adding to visited set)\n        if neighbor not in visited or neighbor not in Q.queue:  # Add to queue and/or visited set if not yet visited/not in queue/not part of path before from start node to destination node (add to visited set) or has not been visited before (add to queue)\n            visited.add(neighbor)  # Add neighbor to visited set for BFS with next iteration of BFS (to avoid visiting same node multiple times)\n            Q.put(neighbor)  # Add neighbor to queue for next iteration of BFS (to explore adjacent nodes)\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: [21, 20, 6, 9].
