DFS is a search algorithm that explores the graph by moving from a given starting node to the next node in the shortest possible path. It uses a stack to keep track of the nodes that have not yet been visited.\n\nSolution:\n\nThe shortest path from node 3 to node 5 is:\n\n1->2->4\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2->4->5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 6], [0, 3], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 4], [5, 7]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 3 to node 4 in the given graph is:\n\n1->2\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2->4."}]
