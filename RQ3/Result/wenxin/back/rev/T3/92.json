Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Initialize a distance array to all infinity, where the starting node has a distance of 0.\n2. Initialize a priority queue to hold nodes.\n3. Pop the first node from the priority queue. This will be node 3.\n4. Initialize the distance to infinity.\n5. Update the distance of the popped node (node 3) to its neighboring nodes.\n6. For each adjacent node, if the distance to that node is less than what we have so far, update it.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the priority queue is empty or all nodes have been processed.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to our graph:\n\n1. Initialize distance array with all infinity, except for node 3 with a distance of 0 (start node).\n2. Pop node 3 from priority queue.\n3. Update distances of nodes 4 and 7, as they are adjacent to node 3 and are currently not visited (i.e., their distances are infinity). Update their distances to 1 and 2 respectively.\n4. Update distances of nodes 6 and 12, as they are adjacent to node 6 and are currently not visited (i.e., their distances are infinity). Update their distances to 2 and 3 respectively.\n5. After popping all nodes, the priority queue is empty, so we know that we have found the shortest path from node 3 to node 6, which is \"3->4->6\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"Therefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 6 is '3->4->6'.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 12], [1, 7], [1, 4], [2, 4], [2, 12], [3, 6], [5, 6], [6, 10], [6, 11], [6, 8], [7, 9], [8, 12]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 3 to node 4 in the given graph is \"3->4\"."}]
