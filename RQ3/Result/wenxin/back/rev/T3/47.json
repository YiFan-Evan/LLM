We start by setting the \"distance\" of node 0 to node 3 to infinity (since we don't know the shortest path yet).\n2. Then, we iterate over all edges starting from node 0. For each edge, we check if the distance from the source node to the target node can be reduced by following this edge.\n3.

You mentioned that there is an edge from node 4 to node 5 with weight 1, but there is also an edge from node 4 to node 3 with weight 1, which could potentially affect the shortest path.\n\nTo find the shortest path, we need to follow the shortest path from node 0 to node 4 and then from node 4 to node 5. To do this, we can use a combination of Dijkstra's algorithm and Bellman-Ford algorithm.\n\nExplanation of fundamental principles:\n\n1. We start by setting the \"distance\" of node 0 to node 5 to infinity (since we don't know the shortest path yet).\n2. Then, we iterate over all edges starting from node 0.

If this is the case, we update the distance of the target node to all other nodes, excluding the source node, with the sum of the edge weight and the current distance.\n4.

We continue this process until we reach node 5.\n\nNow, applying these principles to your specific problem:\n\nStep 1: Initially, the distance from node 0 to node 5 is set to infinity (not known yet).\n\nStep 2: There are several edges that connect nodes, such as 0->3 (weight: infinity), 0->7 (weight: infinity), and 4->5 (weight: 1). We also have an edge from node 4 to node 3 with weight of infinity, which needs to be checked separately.\n\nStep 3: Following edge 0->3 does not reduce the distance, but following edge 4->5 reduces it by 1. Therefore, we update the distance of node 5 to all other nodes except node 0 to be 1 (sum of edge weight and current distance).\n\nStep 4: Since there is an edge from node 4 to node 3 with weight of infinity, we need to follow this edge first before reaching node 5. Therefore, we update the distance of node 3 to all other nodes with the sum of the edge weight and the current distance.\n\nStep 5: Since we have reached node 5, we stop considering further edges.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [0, 7, 4]. This path from node 0 to node 7 traverses all nodes and returns to node 0 before reaching node 5. The next step is from node 7 to node 4 with weight of infinity. However, as explained earlier, this part is not needed for finding the shortest path from node 0 to node 5. Therefore, it is omitted from the final answer. This path is still a valid shortest path from node 0 to node 5 in the given graph."}]
