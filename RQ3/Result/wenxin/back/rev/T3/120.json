Define the start node and destination node.\n2. Initialize a priority queue (or similar data structure) with the nodes from the graph that are reachable from the start node.\n3. Initialize a distance array for each node, setting the distance to infinity for all nodes except the start node, which is set to 0.\n4. Traverse the priority queue and update the distance array for each node that has been visited, keeping track of the shortest distance to reach the destination node.\n\nNow, applying these principles to the provided graph:\n\n* Start with node 7 as the start node and node 12 as the destination node.\n* Create a priority queue with nodes reachable from node 7. These are nodes 7, 2, 3, and 6.\n* Initialize a distance array for each node in the priority queue, setting the distance to infinity for all nodes except node 7, which is set to 0.\n* Perform a Dijkstra-like algorithm on the priority queue, updating the distance array for each node that has been visited.\n* The shortest distance found is 3, which corresponds to the path 7 -> 3 -> 6 -> 12.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->6->12."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 14], [2, 3], [3, 7], [4, 13], [5, 12], [5, 6], [6, 13], [6, 7], [8, 10], [8, 14], [9, 12], [11, 12]]} The start node: 7 The destination: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u8981\u627e\u5230\u4ece\u8282\u70b97\u5230\u8282\u70b96\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u6216Bellman-Ford\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4e0b\u9762\u662f\u4f7f\u7528Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\n\n1. \u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u961f\u5217\uff08\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u961f\u5217\u662f\u5e26\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u5143\u7d20\u6309\u7167\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u987a\u5e8f\u5b58\u50a8\uff09\u6216\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b97\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u3002\n2. \u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ddd\u79bb\u6570\u7ec4\uff0c\u521d\u59cb\u503c\u90fd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b97\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e3a0\u3002\n3. \u4ece\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u53d6\u51fa\u8ddd\u79bb\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u8be5\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u90bb\u5c45\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u6dfb\u52a0\u5230\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u3002\n4. \u91cd\u590d\u6b65\u9aa43\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u961f\u5217\u4e3a\u7a7a\u3002\n5. \u5728\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u961f\u5217\u4e3a\u7a7a\u540e\uff0c\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u5269\u4e0b\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u5c31\u662f\u4ece\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b97\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b96\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u3002\n\n\u6839\u636e\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b97\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b96\uff0c\u4e0a\u8ff0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u8fd4\u56de\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u4e3a\uff1a7 -> 2 -> 6\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u662f\uff1a7->2->6\u3002"}]
