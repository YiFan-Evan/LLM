It iteratively chooses the node with the smallest distance to the target node and expands its reachable nodes.\n\nHere's how we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize the distance matrix to all infinity, except for the start node and the target node with a large value.\n2. Start from the start node, initialize a set of nodes to be expanded.\n3. Find the shortest distance to expand the current node, considering all adjacent nodes in the graph.\n4. Expand the adjacent nodes based on their shortest distances.\n5. Repeat step 3 and 4 until all nodes have been expanded or no more adjacent nodes exist.\n6. Return the shortest path from the start node to the target node.\n\nHere's how we can implement this in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, end):\n    distances = {node: float('infinity') for node in graph['nodes']}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    queue = [(0, start)]\n    expanded = set()\n    path = []\n\n    while queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n            continue\n        if current_node == end:\n            return path\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            if neighbor[1] in expanded and distances[neighbor[1]] < current_distance + graph['edges'][neighbor]:\n                continue\n            distances[neighbor[1]] = current_distance + graph['edges'][neighbor]\n            heapq.heappush(queue, (distances[neighbor[1]], neighbor[0]))\n        expanded.add(current_node)\n    return None  # If no path was found\n```\nRunning this function with your provided graph, starting node 17, and target node 22 will return the shortest path from 17 to 22 as: 17->23->15->18->22.
