Start by considering the node you want to reach (destination) and the node you are currently at (start).\n2. For each edge in the graph, check if it goes from the current node to the next node in the path.\n3. Once you find a path that starts at the start node and ends at the destination node, record the sequence of nodes along that path as the shortest path.\n\nApplying these principles to the given graph and starting node 5 and destination node 4, we can find the shortest path as follows:\n\n1. The start node is 5.\n2. The first edge in the graph is (5, 6).\n3. There is no edge that goes from node 6 to node 4, so we need to follow another path.\n4. The next edge in the graph is (6, 7).\n5. There is no edge that goes from node 7 to node 4, so we need to follow another path.\n6. The last edge in the graph is (4, 7).\n7.
