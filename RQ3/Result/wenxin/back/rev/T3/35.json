Define a distance array for each node, where the distance[i] value represents the shortest distance from node 0 to node i. Initially, all distances are set to infinity (except for distance[4] = 0, because we know that the shortest path from node 0 to node 4 is 0).\n2. Iterate through each edge in the graph, updating the distance array as we go. If there is an edge connecting node i to node j with a lower distance than what is currently stored in distance[j], update distance[j] with the new lower value.\n3. If you reach node 4 while iterating through the graph, you have found a path from node 0 to node 4, and you can stop the algorithm. Otherwise, if you reach a node for which all edges have been visited without reaching node 4, that node cannot be part of the shortest path, so you can ignore it.\n\nThe shortest path in this case is: 0->4 because the shortest distance from node 0 to node 4 is directly connected (no other path exists).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 6], [2, 5], [3, 4], [4, 5], [4, 6], [6, 7]]} The start node: 0 The destination: 4 because the shortest distance from node 0 to node 4 is directly connected (no other path exists).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for your help!
