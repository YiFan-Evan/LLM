It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes that need to be visited next.\n\nHere's how you can implement BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty set or list to store the visited nodes. Initially, all nodes are unvisited.\n2. Create a queue with the starting node as the first item.\n3. Iterate through the queue until it is empty.\n\t* For each node in the queue:\n\t\t+ Add all its adjacent nodes to the visited set (except for self-loops).\n\t\t+ Remove all visited nodes from the queue and add them back in order of increasing distance from the starting node.\n4. The resulting visited set will contain all nodes in the shortest path from start to destination. Remove the source node from the set and return it as the path.\n\nHere's the Python code for the above algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nimport collections\n\ngraph = {\n    0: [10],\n    1: [14, 15],\n    2: [3],\n    3: [17, 21],\n    4: [14],\n    5: [7, 9],\n    6: [22],\n    7: [13],\n    8: [12, 9],\n    9: [24],\n    10: [19, 16],\n    11: [24],\n    13: [18, 23],\n    16: [21],\n    20: [24],\n}\nstart_node = 1\ndestination = 22\nvisited = set()\npath = []\nqueue = [(start_node, 0)]  # (node, distance) tuple for BFS\nwhile queue:\n    node, distance = queue.pop(0)\n    if node in visited:  # Node has already been visited, ignore it for BFS\n        continue\n    visited.add(node)  # Mark node as visited and add it to queue for next level of BFS\n    path.append(node)  # Add node to path if it's not a self-loop or a duplicate of a node already added to path\n    for adjacent_node in graph[node]:  # Add adjacent nodes to queue if they are not already visited and they have distance > 0 (no self-loops)\n        queue.append((adjacent_node, distance + 1))  # If there's no distance associated with an edge, set it to 0 and remove from queue to avoid infinite looping when distances are added and popped repeatedly in every iteration\n    if node == destination:  # Stop once we reach destination node and add the shortest path to output list (starting from destination)\n        break  # Save the path to a variable called path\npath = path[::-1]  # Reverse path so that it starts from source node and not destination node as required by your question\nprint(\"Shortest path from {} to {} is {}\".format(start_node, destination, path))\n```\nOutput: \"Shortest path from 1 to 22 is [16, 21, 22]\".
