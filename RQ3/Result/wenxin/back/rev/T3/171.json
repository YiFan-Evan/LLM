Here are the principles involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. **Shortest Path** - To find the shortest path, we need to follow the edges in order. The edges in the graph represent connections between nodes, and the direction of each edge indicates whether a node can be reached from another node by following that edge in that direction.\n2. **DFS (Depth-First Search)** - One possible approach for finding the shortest path is using Depth-First Search (DFS). DFS explores all possible paths from a given node to find the shortest path.\n\nNow, based on the provided graph and starting node 10, here's the shortest path from node 10 to node 9:\n\nStep 1: Start from node 10 and follow edge 9->12->23->19 to reach node 9.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->9\n\nNote: The provided graph is not complete, so it's possible that there are other paths that are shorter than the one mentioned above.
