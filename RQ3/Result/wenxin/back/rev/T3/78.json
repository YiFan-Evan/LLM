Dijkstra's algorithm: This algorithm is used to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It uses a priority queue to maintain the shortest distances to each node and select the next node to explore based on its distance.\n\n2. Pre-processing: Before applying Dijkstra's algorithm, we need to pre-process the graph by computing the distances between all pairs of nodes. This can be done using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the given graph and find the shortest path from node 5 to node 6:\n\nStep 1: Pre-process the graph using BFS and compute the distances between all pairs of nodes. This step takes O(n^2) time, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.\n\nStep 2: Apply Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue that contains only nodes within reach of the starting node (node 5). Since there are only five nodes in the graph, this step takes O(log n) time.\n\nStep 3: After Dijkstra's algorithm finishes, we will have a list of shortest paths from node 5 to each node in the graph. We can find the shortest path from node 5 to node 6 by following the list of edges and adding them to our path in order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 5 to node 6 in the given graph is 5->2->3->6.
