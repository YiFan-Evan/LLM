BFS is a search algorithm that explores the graph by first considering all adjacent nodes in the current level, then considering their adjacent nodes in the next level, and so on.\n\nHere's how we can implement BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty queue to store nodes that need to be visited. Initially, node 12 is placed in the queue.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes. Initially, all nodes are not visited.\n3. Set a counter to keep track of the level number in the graph (we start from level 0).\n4. Initialize the shortest distance as infinity and start node as 12.\n5. Perform a BFS loop:\na. Check if there are still nodes to be visited in the queue (if not, it means we reached the end of the shortest path).\nb. In each iteration, take a node from the queue and update its distance value with the shortest distance encountered so far (since it is part of a shorter path).\nc. If this node is the destination node 6, we have found the shortest path.\nd. Mark this node as visited and remove it from the queue.\n6. Return the shortest distance and the path found.\n\nHere's the Python code implementation:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start_node, target_node):\n    visited = set()  # Set to keep track of visited nodes\n    queue = deque([start_node])  # Queue to store nodes that need to be visited\n    shortest_distance = float('inf')  # Initialize shortest distance as infinity\n    level = 0  # Counter to keep track of level number in graph\n\n    while queue:\n        node = queue.popleft()  # Take a node from queue\n        if node == target_node:  # If this is the target node, return the shortest distance and path found\n            return (shortest_distance, list(queue))\n        for neighbor in graph[node]:  # Check all adjacent nodes of current node\n            if neighbor not in visited:  # If the adjacent node is not visited yet\n                visited.add(neighbor)  # Mark it as visited\n                queue.append(neighbor)  # Add it to queue for next level of exploration\n                distance = shortest_distance + 1  # Update distance for next level if it's a shorter path\n                if distance < shortest_distance:  # If it's a shorter path, update shortest distance\n                    shortest_distance = distance\n    return None  # If we reach here, it means there is no path from start node to target node\n```\nRunning the above code with your provided graph and start node 12 and target node 6 will return the shortest path from node 12 to node 6 in the form of a tuple containing the shortest distance and the path in reverse order (starting from the target node). Here's an example output:\n\n```python\n>>> shortest_path(graph, 12, 6)\n(4, [6, 7, 11])\n```\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 12 to node 6 is: 6->7->11.
