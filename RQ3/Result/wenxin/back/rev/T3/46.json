First, initialize a set of visited nodes with all nodes in the graph.\n2. Then, initialize the distance from start node to all nodes as infinity except for the start node itself, which is set to 0.\n3. Then, for each node in the graph, calculate the shortest distance to the target node 4 using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nDijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path by iteratively removing the node with the maximum remaining distance from the target node and updating the distances of adjacent nodes based on their weights. It then removes those adjacent nodes that do not reduce the shortest distance.\n\nIn this case, node 4 will have the shortest distance from node 3 since it has a direct edge connection (4 -> 7) that does not have a longer path in between.\n\nHere's the code in pseudocode:\n\n\n```pseudo\ninitialize all nodes as unvisited\nadd start node 3 to visited set\nset distance of node 3 to target node 4 to 0\nfor each node n in nodes do:\n    if n is not visited:\n        remove n from visited set\n        calculate shortest distance from n to target node 4 using Dijkstra's algorithm\n        if shortest distance is less than current distance:\n            update current distance for n and its adjacent nodes\nadd node 4 back to visited set\nreturn shortest distance from start node 3 to target node 4\n```\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 3 to node 4 is 3->2->3->4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 7], [6, 7]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 3 to node 3 in the provided graph is an empty path.
