Here's how we can solve the problem:\n\nPrinciple: Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It iteratively updates the shortest distance between a node and its neighbors, until it reaches the destination node.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a set of visited nodes (say, visited) as an empty set.\n2. Initialize a priority queue (say, queue) with the starting node (node 1) as the priority.\n3. Iterate over the queue until it is empty:\n\t* Remove the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\n\t* If the removed node is equal to the destination node (node 4), then we have found our path.\n\t* Otherwise, mark the removed node as visited and update the distances of its unvisited neighbors.\n4. If we reached the destination node before emptying the queue, then we have found a shorter path to the destination node.\n\nImplementation in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# Graph represented as adjacency list\ngraph = {\n    0: [2],\n    1: [3, 5],\n    2: [4],\n    3: [],\n    4: [],\n    5: [7],\n    6: [],\n    7: []\n}\n\n# Nodes in the graph (in starting point order)\nstart_node = 1\ndest_node = 4\nvisited = set()  #
