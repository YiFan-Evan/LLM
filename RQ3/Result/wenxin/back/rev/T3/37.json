Start with node 4 as the current node.\n2. Find the shortest distance to all neighboring nodes of node 4.\n3. If the shortest distance to a neighboring node is less than the current distance to that node, update the current node and distance to that neighboring node.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until reaching node 3.\n\nSolution:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->2->3\n\nThe shortest path from node 4 to node 3 is 4->2->3 because there are only two edges connecting nodes 2 and 3, and the distance from node 4 to node 2 is less than the distance from node 4 to node 3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [1, 2], [2, 4], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 4 to node 2 is 4->2\n\nIn the graph provided, there are direct edges from node 4 to node 2, and from node 5 to node 2, with distances of 3 and 1 respectively.
