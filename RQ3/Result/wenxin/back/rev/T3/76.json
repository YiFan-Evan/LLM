The 'nodes' array contains the node IDs, while the 'edges' array contains pairs of nodes and the cost of the edge. The provided start node is 2 and the destination node is 3.\n\nThe shortest path from node 2 to node 3 using Dijkstra's algorithm would be:\n\n2 -> 4 -> 3\n\nHowever, if you are specifically looking for the path from 2 to 3 using an edge or if you need to check whether such an edge exists in the graph, then it's difficult to provide you with a direct answer because there isn't any edge directly from node 2 to node 3 in the provided graph. You can, however, check for the existence of such an edge in the graph using the 'edges' array.\n\nIf you want to know if there is a path from node 2 to node 3 using any edge, you can iterate over all edges and check if there is a path from node 2 to node 3 using any of them.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfor edge in graph['edges']:\n    node1, node2, cost = edge\n    if node1 == 2 and node2 == 3:\n        path = [node1]  # Assume you want to start from node 2\n        while len(path) < len(graph['nodes']) and len(graph['nodes']) - path > 0:\n            node = path[-1]\n            for neighbor, edge_cost in graph['edges']:\n                if neighbor in path and edge_cost < graph['nodes'][node] + edge_cost:\n                    path.append(neighbor)\n        print(\"The shortest path from node 2 to node 3 using edge:\", edge, \"is:\", path[::-1])\n```\nPlease note that this assumes that all nodes in the graph are represented as integers.
