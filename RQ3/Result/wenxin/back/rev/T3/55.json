Initialize a set of \"distances\" for each node, initially setting all distances to infinity.\n2. Initialize a priority queue with the starting node (node 2) as the priority.\n3. Select the node with the smallest distance from the starting node (the \"shortest\" distance). Remove this node from the priority queue.\n4. Repeat step 3 until all nodes have been processed:\n\t* Check the \"next\" nodes of the current node.\n\t* If there is a path from the current node to the next node that is shorter than the current distance, update the distance to the next node.\n\t* If there is no such path, skip to the next node in the priority queue.\n5. After all nodes have been processed, the shortest path from node 2 to node 3 is the distance of the last node processed in step 3.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to our graph:\n\n* Initialize all distances to infinity (or an extremely large number if you prefer).\n* Set the distance of node 2 to zero, because it's our starting point.\n* Remove node 2 from the priority queue.\n* Iterate through the \"next\" nodes of node 2. Nodes 1 and 5 have zero distance from node 2 and are thus candidates for being shortest paths from node 2 to node 3. However, we need to compare their distances to node 3 to see if there's a shorter path through them.\n* Node 5 has a shorter distance to node 3 (i.e., 1) than node 1 (i.e., 2). So, set the distance of node 5 to 1 and update its distance in the priority queue.\n* After processing all nodes, we'll have a shortest path from node 2 to node 3 of length 1 (i.e., 2->5->3).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2->3->4->7."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u597d\u7684\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u60a8\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u56fe\u548c\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u4ece\u8282\u70b92\u5230\u8282\u70b94\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff1a\n\n\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u4e3a\uff1a2 -> 4\n\n\u89e3\u91ca\uff1a\n\n* \u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u6309\u7167\u987a\u5e8f\u7f16\u53f7\u4e3a0\u52307\u3002\n* \u8fb9\u7684\u6570\u7ec4\u8868\u793a\u8282\u70b9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8fde\u63a5\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\n* \u4ece\u8282\u70b92\u5230\u8282\u70b94\u6709\u4e00\u6761\u8fb9\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u4e3a4\u3002\n\n\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u662f\u4ece\u8282\u70b92\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8282\u70b94\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u957f\u5ea6\u4e3a2 + 4 = 6\u3002\u6700\u7ec8\u7684\u7b54\u6848\u5c31\u662f\u201c2 -> 4\u201d\u3002"}]
