Initialize a set of visited nodes and a priority queue (for storing nodes with the shortest distances).\n2. Set the distance of the start node to 0 and mark it as visited.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n\t* Extract the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\n\t* If the extracted node is the destination node, stop the algorithm and return the path from the start node to the destination node.\n\t* For each adjacent node of the extracted node:\n\t\t+ Update the distance of the adjacent node using the distance of the extracted node plus the edge weight.\n\t\t+ If the updated distance is smaller than the current distance of the adjacent node, update the distance and mark it as visited.\n4.
