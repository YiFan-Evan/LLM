Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It starts by choosing the node with the smallest distance from the starting node and then moves to the neighbor of that node with the smallest distance. It continues this process until it reaches the destination node.\n\nHere's how you can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 4:\n\n1. Define the starting node (2) and the destination node (4).\n2. Create an empty set called shortestDistances, which will hold the distances from the starting node to each node in the graph. Initially, all distances will be infinity or some large number, since we haven't calculated any distances yet.\n3. Initialize a variable called shortestPath to be an empty list, which will hold the nodes in the shortest path from the starting node to the destination node. Initially, it will be an empty list.\n4. Iterate through each node in the graph, starting from node 2. For each node, calculate its distance from node 2 using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n5. If a shorter distance is found for a node that is not yet in shortestPath, add it to shortestPath and update its distance in shortestDistances.\n6. Continue this process until all nodes in the graph have been visited.\n\nIn this case, after applying Dijkstra's algorithm, you will find that the shortest path from node 2 to node 4 is: 2->10->4, which has a distance of 2 + 1 = 3 nodes hops. Therefore, the final answer is: [2, 10, 4].\n\nNote: This is a basic explanation of Dijkstra's algorithm and assumes that you have access to a programming language that supports this algorithm. You can implement this algorithm in any programming language that supports graph algorithms."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 11], [0, 10], [2, 10], [3, 13], [3, 4], [4, 10], [5, 9], [6, 14], [7, 11], [8, 13], [9, 12], [9, 14], [10, 12]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The shortest path from node 2 to node 10 is 2 -> 10.
