This will give you the shortest path from node 9 to node 2 (if it exists).\n2. Repeat the process by moving from node 2 to neighboring nodes (nodes with indexes 4 and 9) until you reach node 1.\n\nExplanation of the above steps:\n\n* We start from node 9 because it is the starting point specified in the problem.\n* Then, we go to node 4, which is adjacent to node 9 (as specified by the graph edges array). If this is a valid path to node 2, we can skip it.\n* Next, we move to node 2 (as specified by the edges array).\n* Finally, we go to neighboring nodes 9 and 5. Node 5 is not directly adjacent to node 2, but it is directly adjacent to node 1, so we follow it to reach our destination node 1.\n\nThe final shortest path is: \"9->5->1\".
