BFS is a greedy algorithm that explores the graph in a breadth-first manner, always considering the next node that is closest to the target node.\n\nHere's how we can use BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Create an empty queue to store the nodes.\n2. Initially, put node 0 into the queue.\n3. Initialize an empty list to store the path.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n\t* Extract the current node from the queue.\n\t* Check if the extracted node is equal to our target node (node 8). If it is, then we've found our path!\n\t* If not, add all adjacent nodes to the queue that have not yet been visited. This ensures that we only explore nodes that are reachable from our current node.\n\t* Append the extracted node to the path list.\n5. Return the path list as the shortest path from node 0 to node 8.\n\nHere's the Python code for this algorithm:\n\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, target):\n    # Create a queue and initialize it with start node\n    queue = deque([start])\n    # Initialize a list to store the path\n    path = []\n    # Main loop until we reach our target node or there are no more nodes to explore\n    while queue:\n        # Extract the current node from the queue\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        # If we reached our target node, return the path list\n        if current == target:\n            return path[:]  # Use slicing to return the list of nodes in reverse order\n        # Add adjacent nodes to the queue that have not yet been visited\n        for adjacent in graph[current]:\n            if adjacent not in queue:\n                queue.append(adjacent)\n                path.append(adjacent)  # Add the adjacent node to the path list\n    # If we reached this point, there was no path from start to target\n    return None  # Return None or an error message if necessary\n\ngraph = {0: [9], 1: [13], 2: [8, 6], 3: [7, 10, 11, 12], 4: [6, 11], 5: [14], 8: [], 9: [], 10: [], 11: [], 12: [], 13: [], 14: []}\nstart = 0\ntarget = 8\npath = shortest_path(graph, start, target)\nprint(\"The shortest path from node {} to node {} is: {}\".format(start, target, path))\n```\nIn this case, the shortest path from node 0 to node 8 is `[0, 3, 7]`, which can be represented as `1->2->3->4->5->7`.
