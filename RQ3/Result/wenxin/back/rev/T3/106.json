Start by considering the nodes in the starting point (node 8).\n2. Then, consider the nodes that are reachable from the starting point through the edges.\n3. Iterate through the nodes and their adjacent edges until you reach the target node (node 3).\n\nNow, let's solve the problem using these principles:\n\n1. Start with node 8: This is our starting point. We'll go through all the edges adjacent to node 8 and follow them until we reach node 3.\n2. Follow edge [3, 8]: This edge connects node 3 to node 8. We'll follow this edge and reach node 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->3\n\nSo, the shortest path from node 8 to node 3 is: 8->3."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 6], [1, 7], [1, 9], [2, 4], [3, 10], [3, 11], [3, 8], [4, 11], [5, 9], [6, 8], [6, 12]]} The start node: 8 The destination: 3\n\nSo, the shortest path from node 8 to node 3 is: 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!
