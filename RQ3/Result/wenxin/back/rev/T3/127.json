BFS is a search algorithm that explores the graph by starting from a given node and moving to its neighbors, then moving to their neighbors, and so on. It finds the shortest path by always considering the shortest distance between nodes.\n\nHere's how you can solve this problem using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue Q to store the nodes to be visited.\n2. Initialize the queue with the starting node (node 10).\n3. Create an empty set S to store visited nodes.\n4. Initialize S with the starting node (node 10).\n5. While Q is not empty:\n\t* Extract the first node from Q (node 10).\n\t* If the extracted node is the destination node (node 6), then you have found the shortest path.\n\t* Otherwise, add all adjacent nodes of the extracted node to Q and also to S.\n6. Return the shortest path found in S.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shortest path from node 10 to node 6 is: 10->8->6.
