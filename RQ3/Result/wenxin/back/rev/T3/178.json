Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n1. Initialize a distance array of size equal to the number of nodes in the graph, with all distances set to infinity (except for the starting node, which is set to 0).\n2. Initialize a set of visited nodes as an empty set.\n3. Start with node 6 and set its distance to 0.\n4. Find the shortest distance from node 6 to all its neighbors. This can be done by checking if the distance from node 6 to each neighbor is less than the current distance to that neighbor in the distance array. If it is, update the distance array and mark the neighbor as visited.\n5. Repeat step 4 for all nodes that are reachable from node 6 until all nodes have been visited.\n6. The shortest path from node 6 to node 4 will be the shortest distance found in the distance array for nodes 6->7->8->4.\n\nHere's how it translates to code in Python:\n\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\n# graph representation\ngraph = {\n    0: [1],\n    1: [2],\n    2: [3, 4],\n    3: [4],\n    4: [],\n    5: [21],\n    6: [21],\n    7: [21],\n    8: [24],\n    9: [19, 24],\n    10: [24],\n    11: [12, 23, 19],\n    12: [],\n    #
