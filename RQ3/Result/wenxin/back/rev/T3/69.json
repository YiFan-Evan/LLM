It uses a priority queue to maintain the shortest distances to each node.\n\t* The algorithm starts from a given starting node and iteratively expands the shortest path to reach the next node. It continues this process until it reaches the target node.\n2. **Solution**:\n\n\n\t* Initialize an empty priority queue `Q` with the starting node `5` as the key.\n\t* Initialize a set `visited` to keep track of nodes that have already been visited.\n\t* Iterate through the edges in the graph:\n\t\n\t\n\t\t+ If a new node `6` is not yet visited and is adjacent to the current node `5`, we can reach `6` by traversing `2->3->4->6`. Therefore, we add `6` to the priority queue `Q` with the distance of `2 + 3 + 4 = 9`.\n\t\t+ If `6` is already visited, we can skip this edge.\n\t\t+ Otherwise, we remove the edge from `Q` and update the distance of `5` to `Q` with the new distance `dist + length of edge`.\n\t* After completing all edges, the shortest distance to `6` will be stored in `dist[6]`.\n\t* The shortest path from `5` to `6` is obtained by reversing the path and converting it into an actual sequence of nodes (i.e., \"6->4->3->2->5\").\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is**: \"The shortest path from node 5 to node 6 is '6->4->3->2->5' with a distance of 9.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 7], [5, 7]]} The start node: 5 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u627e\u5230\u4ece\u8282\u70b95\u5230\u8282\u70b92\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u7528Dijkstra\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4ee5\u4e0b\u662f\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a\n\n1. **\u521d\u59cb\u5316**\uff1a\u9996\u5148\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a7a\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u961f\u5217Q\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8d77\u59cb\u8282\u70b95\u653e\u5165\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u5408visited\u6765\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5df2\u7ecf\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fc7\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u3002\n2. **\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u6269\u5c55**\uff1a\u4ece\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u53d6\u51fa\u8ddd\u79bb\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u76f8\u90bb\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u672a\u8bbf\u95ee\u3002\u5982\u679c\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\u5728\u961f\u5217\u4e2d\u6216\u5728visited\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u8fd9\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u65e0\u6548\uff0c\u7ee7\u7eed\u4e0b\u4e00\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002\u5426\u5219\uff0c\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\u653e\u5165\u961f\u5217\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\n3. **\u66f4\u65b0\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb**\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u88ab\u6807\u8bb0\u4e3a\u672a\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u76f8\u90bb\u8282\u70b9\uff0c\u68c0\u67e5\u662f\u5426\u6709\u65b0\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u8282\u70b92\uff0c\u5e76\u66f4\u65b0\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002\n4. **\u8f93\u51fa\u7ed3\u679c**\uff1a\u5728\u6240\u6709\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b8c\u6210\u540e\uff0c\u8282\u70b92\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u5c06\u4f1a\u5728visited\u96c6\u5408\u4e2d\u3002\u4ece\u8282\u70b95\u5230\u8282\u70b92\u7684\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u662f\uff1a2->4->7\u62165->1->6->7\u3002\u6ce8\u610f\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u90fd\u662f6\u3002\n\n\u6240\u4ee5\uff0c\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u662f\u201c2->4->7\u201d\u6216\u201c5->1->6->7\u201d\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u90fd\u662f6\u3002"}]
