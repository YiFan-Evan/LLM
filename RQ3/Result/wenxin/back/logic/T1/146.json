Therefore, we can infer that Wren is a grimpus and also meets the criteria for being discordant (as stated in the premises (2) and (7)).\n\nNow, we need to find a connection between Wren's classification as a grimpus and its being discordant. Based on the premises (4) and (6), we know that small and lempus creatures are dumpus and numpus creatures respectively. Since Wren is a grimpus, it is also small and a lempus. Therefore, Wren can be classified as a numpus creature.\n\nFinally, based on the premises (6) and (7), we know that numpus creatures are aggressive and discordant. Therefore, we can conclude that Wren is discordant because it is both small and numpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that Wren is discordant and a rompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"(1), (2), (7), (8), (10), (11), (14), (15), (16), (17), (18) -> (3)\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
