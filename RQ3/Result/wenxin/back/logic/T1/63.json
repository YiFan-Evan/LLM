If Polly is temperate, she cannot be both a wumpus and a lorpus. Therefore, we can infer that Polly is not a wumpus.\n\n* (6) Everything that is kind and mean and a wumpus is a vumpus.\n* (16) Polly is cold.\n\nFrom the second premise, we know that vumpus is a sub-type of wumpus, which implies that a kind and mean character may also make someone a wumpus. However, Polly's character of being cold indicates that she is not kind and mean, so we can infer that Polly is not a vumpus.\n\nFrom the remaining premises, we can see that Polly's character of being moderate, fast, and a tumpus is sufficient to make her a lorpus. Therefore, we can conclude that:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (15), (16), (17)] -> (18): Polly is moderate, fast, and a wumpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
