[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

From the first premise, we know that everything that is a grimpus or a tumpus is a yumpus. Since Polly is not a yumpus, it follows that Polly cannot be a grimpus or a tumpus.\n2. From the second premise, we know that everything that is a wumpus or a brimpus is a yumpus. Since Polly is not a yumpus, it follows that Polly cannot be a wumpus or a brimpus.\n3. Therefore, based on the above two premises, we can conclude that Polly cannot be a brimpus or a wumpus.\n\nFrom the third and fourth premises, we know that there are other types of creatures, such as a yumpus or a shumpus. However, this does not affect our conclusion since our focus here is on proving that Polly is not a brimpus or a wumpus.\n\nThus, we have shown that the proof obligation stated in \"(6) Polly is not a brimpus and Polly is not a wumpus\" can be derived from the given premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
