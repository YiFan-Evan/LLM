Sally is kind.\n4. Everything that is wooden and a numpus is a rompus.\n5. Sally is wooden.\n\nTherefore, from these premises, we can conclude that Sally is related to being opaque, rompus, kind, and wooden, which are all related to each other. Based on these relationships, we can infer that Sally is an impus and a rompus. However, to prove that Sally is opaque and a rompus, we need to find a premise that directly states that Sally is both opaque and a rompus.\n\nFrom the given premises, we can see that (1) Everything that is snowy and a sterpus is a jompus and (8) Everything that is wooden and a numpus is a rompus, we can infer that if Sally is snowy or wooden, she is also a rompus. Therefore, it can be inferred that since Sally is opaque and wooden (from (12), (14)), she must also be a rompus.
