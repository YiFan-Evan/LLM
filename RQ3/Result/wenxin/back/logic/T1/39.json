[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first explain the fundamental principles involved in solving it, and then provide the answer to the problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Grimpuses are yumpuses.

The first premise states that Grimpuses are yumpuses, and since Grimpuses are also a type of jompus, we know that every jompus is a yumpus.\n2. The fourth premise tells us that every jompus is a yumpus, so if Max is a jompus, he is a yumpus.\n3. The sixth and seventh premises tell us that every tumpus and shumpus is a yumpus, so if Max is a tumpus or shumpus, he is also a yumpus.\n4. The last premise says that Max can be a jompus, tumpus, or shumpus, so he is also a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, from the premises we have, we can conclude that Max is a yumpus.
