Since we know Rex is metallic, he is also a lempus. Then, from the premise (3), Rex is a brimpus if he is a grimpus or a shumpus. From the premise (8), Rex is mean, which implies he is amenable and aggressive. Therefore, based on the premises (18) and (19), Rex is angry and amenable. Finally, from the premise (20), Rex is aggressive. Based on all these premises, it can be inferred that Rex is both metallic and liquid.
