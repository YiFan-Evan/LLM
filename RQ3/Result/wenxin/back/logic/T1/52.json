You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

If a thing is described with multiple adjectives that are mutually exclusive (such as \"angry\" and \"amenable\"), then it is possible to prove that it has both properties.\n\n2. Stella is described as being shy, angry, a rompus, cold, and hot. She also has the additional characteristic of being a zumpus. Therefore, based on the premises, we can infer that she is also a brimpus, based on the description of brimpus as having characteristics of being angry, amenable, and a brimpus.\n\nTherefore, from the premises given and the rules of inference applied, we can conclude that Stella is angry, amenable, and a brimpus.
