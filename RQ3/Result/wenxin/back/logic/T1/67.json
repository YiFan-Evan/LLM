To prove the proposition (22), we need to find out the necessary and sufficient conditions that satisfy the proposition.\n\nFirstly, from the premises (1), (2), and (3), we know that grimpus can only be defined by specific color(s). Therefore, to prove the proposition (22), we need to find out what color(s) define a grimpus. Since there are only 3 specific colors (blue, orange, brown) in the premise (8) that describe Polly as a brimpus, we can infer that Polly is a grimpus if and only if she is blue, orange, brown or red.\n\nSecondly, we know from the premise (4) that zumpus can also be defined by specific characteristics such as being muffled or loud. However, this does not conflict with the previous inference because it does not contradict that Polly is already described as a grimpus by being color(s) that defines a grimpus. Therefore, the previous inference is still valid and can be combined with premise (9) to form an intermediate conclusion: Polly is both a grimpus and a zumpus.\n\nThirdly, from the premise (6), we know that dumpus is described as being nervous and happy. Therefore, Polly's being described as a zumpus does not conflict with her being described as a dumpus. However, this does not mean that Polly is also described as a grimpus because we have already established that she is described as a grimpus based on her color(s). Therefore, the combination of intermediate conclusion and premise (6) can be used to further infer that Polly is also described as being sunny.\n\nFinally, we can conclude that Polly is blue because she is described as being so in premise (16). She is orange because she is described as such in premise (20). She is brown because she is described as such in premise (14). She is red because she is described as such in premise (21). She is also sunny because she is described as such in premise (6) and also in premise (13). She is also windy because she is described as such in premise (17). Therefore, based on all these premises and deductions, we can conclude that Polly is blue and orange and brown and red and sunny and also a grimpus. This concludes our proof of the proposition (22)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son. (1) Everything that is hot, temperate, cold, and a wumpus is a yumpus.
