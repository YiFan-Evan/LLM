Premise (2) states that \"everything that is opaque, transparent, and a rompus is a dumpus.\" Since Alex is transparent, he must be a dumpus.\n\n2. Premise (4) says that \"everything that is small, large, and a dumpus is a gorpus.\" Since Alex is both small and a dumpus, he must be large.\n\n3. From the previous two premises, we can infer that Alex is both small and large. Therefore, he must be one of the two categories mentioned in the third premise of \"(3) Everything that is amenable, kind, and a rompus is a wumpus.\" Since Alex is kind and amenable, he must be a wumpus.\n\nNow that we have determined that Alex is a wumpus and small/large based on the given premises, we can further deduce that he must also be a dumpus from the second premise mentioned above.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nTherefore, from the premises given we can infer that Alex is a dumpus, a wumpus, and large/small.
