Firstly, from the premise \"(8) Max is a wumpus\" and \"(12) Max is a tumpus,\" we can infer that Max is both a wumpus and a tumpus. 2. Based on the additional premise \"(7) Everything that is metallic and a shumpus is a grumpus,\" we can further conclude that Max is also a grumpus, given his already existing attributes of being a wumpus and tumpus. 3. The final premise, \"(16) Max is metallic,\" completes the proof by stating that Max has the attribute of being metallic, which proves that he is both a shumpus and metallic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: From the given premises, we can infer that Max is both a shumpus and a grumpus, given his attributes of being a wumpus, tumpus, and metallic.
