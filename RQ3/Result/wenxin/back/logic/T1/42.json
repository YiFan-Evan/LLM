Start with the premises and organize them in order of introduction.\n2. Apply the principles of reasoning to build intermediate conclusions from the premises.\n3. Use the intermediate conclusions to prove the desired proof obligation.\n\nFrom the premises, we can infer that Polly is spicy, sweet, and bright. We also know that Polly is liquid and earthy. These premises lead us to conclude that Polly is a lempus or rompus.\n\nFrom the premises (7) and (8), we know that a spicy rompus is a gorpus and that a sweet sterpus is a lempus. Therefore, Polly can be inferred to be a gorpus or lempus based on her spiciness and sweetness.\n\nFinally, from the premises (4), (5), and (6), we know that a dull lempus is a zumpus and that both liquids and luminous items are lempus. Polly fits these descriptions as a zumpus or lempus based on her dullness and her being liquid and luminous.\n\nTherefore, based on these premises and reasoning, we can conclude that Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus. \n\nThe minimal set of premise propositions to prove (16) Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus is '(1),(7),(8)'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
