The first premise, \"(1) Everything that is spicy, sour, and a numpus is a jompus\", does not directly support our proof obligation, but it provides a necessary condition for the definition of \"jumpus\".\n\n2. The second premise, \"(17) Max is discordant\", indicates that Max is a member of the category of things that are discordant, which means that he satisfies the condition of \"discordant\".\n\n3. The third premise, \"(3) Everything that is bright and dull and an impus is a grimpus\", states that if something is both bright and dull, it is a grimpus. Since Max is described as both bright and dull in the last premise, we can infer that he is a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, we can establish a logical link between the given premises and the proof obligation.
