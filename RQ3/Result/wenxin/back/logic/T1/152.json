For example, since Sally is a grimpus (premise 16), she is fast (premise 1). Since she is not sweet (premise 11), she is not also a grimpus (contradiction). We can use these premises to further conclude that Sally is not a grimpus. Similarly, from the premise that every brimpus is a yumpus, we can infer that Sally is not a brimpus.\n\nFrom the premises that every rompus is a jompus, every dumpuse is large, and every numpus is hot, we can infer that Sally is a jompus, a dumpuse, and a numpus respectively. However, we already know from the previous inference that Sally is not a grimpus or a brimpus, so she cannot be a jompus or dumpuse. Therefore, Sally cannot be a numpus either.\n\nSince Sally is not a grimpus, brimpus, jompus, dumpuse, or numpus, and has characteristics such as being fast and having characteristics common to other species identified in the premises (like being windy and being large), we can conclude that Sally is in fact a rompus. However, the evidence given for her being a rompus so far are premises regarding other species or attributes, so we cannot infer that directly from the premises.\n\nTherefore, we can only conclude that Sally is dull based on the premise that every rompus is dull (premise 2). We have eliminated all other possibilities and have no further information to draw conclusions from. Therefore, the only conclusion we can draw from the given premises is that Sally is dull.\n\nNote: This reasoning follows the deductive reasoning process of modus ponens, where we start with the given premises and draw conclusions based on those premises. We then use those conclusions to further infer new information based on our previous conclusions.
