[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Firstly, it's worth noting that premise (8) provides a link between Max and a genus of 'jompuses', implying that Max is a type of jompus. Additionally, (12) states that Max is an impus, which means it's a type of shumpus. Using these premises, we can now examine whether or not Max has the property of melody.\n\nFrom (7), we know that each shumpus is not melodic. However, since Max is a type of shumpus, we can infer that it too cannot be melodic.
