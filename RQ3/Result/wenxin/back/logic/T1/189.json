Introduction of the concept of classification: The premises give us information about various types of animals (such as sterpuses, impuses, brimpuses, etc.) and their properties (such as being cold, sour, happy, etc.). We can use this classification to identify the specific type of animal that Alex belongs to.\n\n2. Modus Ponens: We use this rule of reasoning to move from statements that follow directly from the premises to conclusions. In this case, we can use the premise \"(7) Each impus is not snowy.\" and infer that an impus, such as Alex, is not snowy.\n\nBased on these principles, we can now provide the answer to the stated problem:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"Therefore, from the given premises we can infer that Alex is not a snowy animal, because every impus is not snowy.\" Thus, the proof obligation \"(25) Alex is not snowy.\" can be derived from the given premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
