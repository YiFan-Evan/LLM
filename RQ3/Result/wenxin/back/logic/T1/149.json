Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Based on premise (15), Sam is a vumpus, which implies that every vumpus is transparent by premise (1).\n2. Then, using the conjunction of premise (7) and (8), Sam is a brimpus that is cold.\n3. Using the definition of \"slow\" from premise (2), it can be inferred that brimpuses are slow, and hence that brimpuses are also overcast.\n4.
