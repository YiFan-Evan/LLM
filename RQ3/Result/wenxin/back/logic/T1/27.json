[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

The given premises are connected together using the implication operator \"is a zumpus\" which is a stronger condition than \"is a shumpus or a sterpus\".\n\n2. The negation of \"Alex is not a tumpus\" (premise 4) implies that Alex is a tumpus.\n\n3. The negation of \"(Alex is a zumpus and Alex is a shumpus)\" implies that at least one of the conditions is not true.\n\nTherefore, using these principles, we can use the following sequence of premises to prove the proof obligation:\n\n1.

Everything that is a jompus or a numpus is a zumpus (premise 3)\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that Alex cannot be both a shumpus and a sterpus because they are both subsets of the zumpus category.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, from the given premises [(1) Everything that is a shumpus or a sterpus is a zumpus, (2) Everything that is a jompus or a numpus is a zumpus, (4) Alex is not a tumpus, and (5) Alex is not a zumpus], we can infer that Alex is not a sterpus and Alex is not a shumpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
