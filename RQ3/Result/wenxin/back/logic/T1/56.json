[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

However, in this case, Sam is not a grimpus, so we need to consider other premises.\n\nFrom the second and third premises, we can infer that if something is bright or red, it is a numpus. Based on this information, we can infer that Sam may be a numpus since he is bright (based on premise 2) and/or red (based on premise 3). Therefore, Sam could be rainy or a numpus, depending on which condition applies to him.\n\nFrom the premises 4 and 5, we can also infer that if something is amenable or sour, it is a lorpus or vumpus, respectively. Since Sam is not known to be either of these (premise 7), we cannot use these conditions to rule out his being rainy or a numpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can infer that Sam is rainy or a numpus, and the minimal set of premise propositions that proves this proof obligation is: [(1), (2), (3), (7)] -> (8)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
