Each class of objects is defined by its properties. For example, \"dumpuses\" are defined by their lack of happiness, \"gorpuses\" are defined by their being brimpuses, etc.\n2. Properties can be logically related to each other through inference rules such as modus tollens.\n\nUsing these principles, we can proceed with the proof:\n\n1.
