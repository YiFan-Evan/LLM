Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Premise (6) states that Wren is angry. This implies that Wren is aggressive and mean.\n2. Premise (7) states that Wren is melodic. This means that Wren is harmonious and pleasing to listen to.\n3. Premise (8) states that Wren is bright. This implies that Wren is not dull or dim.\n4. Premise (9) states that Wren is mean. This means that Wren is not kind or benevolent.\n5. Premise (14) states that Wren is dull. This means that Wren is not bright or lively.\n6. The combination of these premises indicates that Wren is aggressive, mean, not kind or benevolent, and not bright or lively. Therefore, it can be inferred that Wren is muffled and loud and discordant and melodic and a dumpus as stated in the proof obligation (18).\n\nSo far, we have derived that Wren has these characteristics because of its aggressive behavior and unkindness. Additionally, because it is melodic, it could be interpreted as harmonious and pleasing to listen to, which is why it is bright. However, because it is also dull and mean, it may also be interpreted as unpleasant to be around or unpleasant to listen to.
