(6)\n2. Max is a jompus. (2)\n3. Max is a zumpus. (4, 15)\n4. Max is a tumpus. (14)\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that a lempus is a gorpus. Since Max is a lempus, he is also a gorpus. Using the third premise, we know that everything that is a zumpus and a tumpus is a yumpus. Therefore, Max is also a yumpus. From the fourth premise, we know that Max is a numpus. Finally, we know from the second premise that Max is a jompus and that jompuses are yumpuses, so Max is a yumpus and a jompus.\n\nNow, let's consider the proof obligation: \"Prove that Max is not an impus.\" If Max is an impus, then he must be either one of the three mentioned above (lempus, tumpus, or numpus) and an impus or any of the types mentioned in the final conclusion. But this can't be true because of the premises given: the first and sixth statements tell us that lempuses are not yumpuses and that every lempus is a gorpus; the third and fourth statements tell us that zumpuses, tumpuses, and numpuses are yumpuses; and the seventh statement tells us that Max is a gorpus. Therefore, we can conclude that Max cannot be an impus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions to prove (17) Max is not an impus is: [(6), (2), (4), (7), (14)].\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [(6), (2), (4), (7), (14)]->(17)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
