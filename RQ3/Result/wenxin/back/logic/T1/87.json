The premises provide a set of rules for identifying different types of animals based on their characteristics.\n2. The rules state that certain animals have certain traits, and that if a given animal has a certain trait, they are also a certain type of animal.\n3. Based on these rules, we can infer that if Sally is a brimpus, she is also a wumpus, because everything that is dull or a lorpus is a brimpus.\n4.
