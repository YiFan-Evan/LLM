Combine information given in different premises by logical reasoning.\n2. Apply deductive reasoning based on the established premises.\n\nBased on these principles, here's the process:\n\n1. From premise (1), we know that Vumpuses are opaque and lempuses. And from (4), lempuses are spicy and brimpuses and grimpuses. Therefore, vumpuses are opaque, spicy, and brimpuses or grimpuses.\n2. From (3), we know that Brimpuses are blue, yumpuses, and jompuses. However, wren is opaque and a lempus and a grimpus, which indicates that wren is not blue, but spicy and brimpish (as lempuses are brimpish and grimpuses are also brimpish). Therefore, Wren cannot be a brimpus.\n3. From (7), we know that every wumpus is sunny, a sterpus, and an impus. However, wren is sunny and a sterpus, which indicates that wren is not a wumpus. Therefore, Wren cannot be a brimpus.\n4. From (9), we know that Wren is opaque and a lempus and a grimpus. And from (5), we know that each yumpus is bright and a zumpus and a numpus. Therefore, wren must be bright and grimpish (as it is opaque and a grimpus).\n5. From (8), we know that each dumpus is small and large and a gorpus. And since wren is bright and grimpish, it must also be small or large (and therefore a dumpus).\n6. Since wren is also a dumpus (from above), we can infer that Wren must be either a yumpus or a jompus from (3) and (6).\n7. Since Wren is also a brimpus from (1), we can conclude that Wren must be a jompus from (6).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can prove that Wren is a jompus. \n\nTo prove specifically that Wren is a brimpus requires additional premises or evidence beyond what has been provided.
