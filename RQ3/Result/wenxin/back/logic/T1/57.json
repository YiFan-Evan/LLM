Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

(13) Wren is a gorpus]\n\nDeductive reasoning:\n\n1. Wren is a grimpus (premise 12) and according to premise 2, grimpus is a type of impus, therefore Wren is an impus.\n2. Based on premise 8, Wren is slow and from premise 4, slow and fast and an impus is a lempus, so Wren is both slow and an impus.\n3. Similarly, from premise 7, Wren is dull and from premise 5, dull and bright and a grimpus is a sterpus, so Wren is both dull and a grimpus.\n4. Based on the above reasoning, Wren can be classified as both a grimpus and a slow impus. Furthermore, from the same premises it can be inferred that since Wren is bright, it must also be fast according to premise 3.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Wren is slow, fast, and an impus as stated in the proof obligation (14)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
