Based on the premises, we can follow the following reasoning to prove the target proposition:\n\n1. Wren is fruity, earthy, floral, and a rompus (premise 7).\n2. From the fact that Wren is sweet (premise 11), we can infer that Wren is sweet and spicy (because sweetness and spiciness are both properties of Wren).\n3. From the fact that Wren is sour (premise 9), we can infer that Wren is sour and a brimpus (because sourness and brimposity are both properties of Wren).\n4. From the fact that Wren is sunny (premise 1), we can infer that Wren is a wumpus (because sunnyness is a property of Wumpus).\n5. From the fact that Wren is a wumpus, a shumpus, and a rompus (premise 8, 16), we can infer that Wren is also a brimpus.\n\nCombining these four inferences, we can conclude that Wren is sweet, spicy, sour, and a brimpus.
