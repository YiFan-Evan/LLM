[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Premise (1) states that everything that is nervous, feisty, or a tumpus is a brimpus. Since Max is a wumpus, he cannot be nervous or feisty or a tumpus. Therefore, Max cannot be a brimpus.\n\n2. Premise (2) says that everything that is blue or orange or a lempus is a tumpus. However, we know that Max is not a tumpus from the previous rule, so he cannot be blue or orange or a lempus.\n\n3. Premise (3) says that everything that is aggressive or angry or a gorpus is a lempus. Max is known to be aggressive and angry, so he must be a lempus.\n\n4. From the above three premises, we know that Max is a lempus and he is aggressive and angry. Therefore, he cannot be cold or hot or a lempus according to premise (5).\n\n5. Premise (4) states that everything that is small, large, or an impus is a vumpus. Since Max is already known to be a lempus, he cannot be small or large or an impus. Therefore, he cannot be a vumpus either.\n\n6. From the above four premises, we know that Max cannot be a brimpus, tumpus, vumpus, or grimpus. Therefore, he must be a yumpus according to premise (6).\n\n7. Premise (8) states that everything that is windy, rainy, or a gorpus is a dumpus. Since Max is already known to be a yumpus and the environment he is in (according to premise (9)) cannot cause him to be either transparent or opaque or a wumpus. He cannot be dumpus as well because it's rainy. Therefore, Max cannot be windy or rainy according to this rule either.\n\n8. From the above five premises, we know that Max is not a brimpus, tumpus, vumpus, grimpus, nor dumpus. Therefore, he must be an impus according to premise (7).\n\n9. Finally, we have reached the conclusion that Max is an impus and his color (blue) has been established by premise (1) and (2). He is either orange or a lempus based on the nature of his actions and emotions according to the other premises listed above.
