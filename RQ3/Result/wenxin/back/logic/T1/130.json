Premise (1) states that vumpus and hot, temperate, cold, and a shumpus belong to the same category. Therefore, Sally being a shumpus means that she must be a vumpus.\n\n2. Premise (2) stipulates that zumpus belong to the class of red, blue, brown, and a yumpus. Therefore, since Sally is a zumpus, she must also be a yumpus.\n\n3. From (1) and (2), it follows that Sally is a vumpus and a yumpus.\n\n4. Premise (18) states that Sally is happy and feisty. Since Sally is already a vumpus and a yumpus, this means that she must also be happy and feisty as stipulated in (18).\n\n5. Finally, we have to prove that Sally is also shy and a yumpus. This can be derived from premise (19), which stipulates that red belongs to the class of spicy, bitter, sour, and a zumpus. Since Sally is already a zumpus and red, it follows that she must also be shy and a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can conclude that Sally is happy, feisty, shy, and a yumpus.
