All propositions given in the premises must be true and relevant to the statement to be proved.\n\n2. The relationships defined in the premises must be consistent with the statement to be proved.\n\n3. The reasoning process must follow a logical order and be consistent with the relationships defined in the premises.\n\nFrom the premises given, we can draw the following relationships:\n\n1. \"Everything that is sour and a lempus is a sterpus\" (premise 1)\n2. \"Everything that is cold and a lempus is a numpus\" (premise 2)\n3. \"Fae is a tumpus\" (premise 13)\n\nUsing these relationships, we can infer that \"Fae is sour\" and \"Fae is cold\". Since \"Fae is a tumpus\", we can also infer that \"Fae is a shumpus\" (premise 16). Based on premise 17, we know that \"everything that is wooden and a jompus is a tumpus\", which implies that \"Fae is wooden\".\n\nTherefore, using these inferred relationships, we can prove \"(18) Fae is cold and a lempus\".
