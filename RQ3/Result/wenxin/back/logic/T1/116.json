Based on the premises, we can infer that Sam is a yumpus, which is included in the set of premises for the wumpus category. Additionally, we know from the premise (6) that Sam is spicy. Therefore, we can infer that Sam is spicy based on the combination of these two premises. Similarly, we can infer that Sam is bitter, sour, and sweet based on the corresponding premises (12), (14), and (18). As for the brimpus category, we have a single premise (4) which states that happy and feisty and a yumpus is a brimpus. Since Sam is happy and feisty, he falls into this category.
