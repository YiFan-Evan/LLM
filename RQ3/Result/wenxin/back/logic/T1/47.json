We also know that Alex is earthy and floral and fruity and a wumpus, which means he is also a jompus. Therefore, Alex is both a grimpus and a jompus.\n\nFrom the premise that Alex is orange, we can infer that he is also brown and blue. Furthermore, based on the premise that Alex is feisty, shy, nervous, and a grimpus, we know that he has these three qualities: feisty (a grimpus is typically described as being feisty), shy (Alex is shy), nervous (Alex is nervous), and he is also a grimpus (Alex is overcast and windy and rainy and a lempus).\n\nTherefore, based on the premises provided, we can conclude that Alex is feisty, shy, nervous, and a grimpus.
