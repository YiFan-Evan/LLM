Based on the premises, we can follow these steps to prove the desired conclusion:\n\n1. From the first premise, we know that each sterpus is a shumpus and a grimpus. Therefore, we can infer that Polly, being a gorpu and a wumpus, is also a shumpus and a grimpus.\n2. From the third premise, we know that shumpuses are impuses and vumpuses. Therefore, we can infer that Polly, being a shumpus and a grimpus, is also an impus and a vumpus.\n3. From the fourth premise, we know that every yumpus is happy and a dumpus. However, we cannot use this directly to prove our conclusion because Polly is not yet identified as a yumpus.\n4.
