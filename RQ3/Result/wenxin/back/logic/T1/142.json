Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the proof process:\n\n1. Fundamental Principles: The premises provide information about different types of creatures (zumpuses, tumpuses, grimpuses, etc.) and their relationships. The proof obligation requires us to use these relationships to establish a contradiction with the claim \"(13) Stella is not a gorpus.\"\n\n2. Application of Premises: We start by using the information provided in the premises to establish that Stella is a zumpus, a tumpus, and a grimpus, based on (1), (4), and (7).\n\n3. Intermediate Conclusion: We further combine the premises (4), (7), and (8) to infer that Stella is also a grMPU (the term \"grimpus\" used in the premises is used interchangeably with \"grMPU\" in this proof).\n\n4. Application of Relationships: Based on the information provided in (9), we know that zumpuses are lorpuses. Therefore, Stella, as a zumpus, must also be a lorpus.\n\n5. Contradiction: Finally, we use the premise (11) to infer that Stella is also a rompus and a jompus, which contradicts the claim \"(13) Stella is not a gorpus.\" Therefore, we can conclude that Stella is a gorpu.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\"Therefore, the proof of (13) Stella is not a gorpu. requires only the premises [(1) Stella is a zumpus., (4) Jompuses are zumpuses., (7) Each impus is a lorpus and a tumpus and a grimpus., (8) Grimpuses are rompuses., and (9) Zumpuses are lorpuses.]\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
