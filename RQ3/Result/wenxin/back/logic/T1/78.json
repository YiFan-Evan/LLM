Everything that is fast, moderate, and a yumpus is a shumpus (premise 5) and Alex is fast (premise 10), so Alex is a shumpus.\n\n2. Everything that is discordant, melodic, and a yumpus is a vumpus (premise 2) and Alex is discordant (premise 7), so Alex is a vumpus.\n\n3. Everything that is red, blue, and an impus is a brimpus (premise 3) and Alex is blue (premise 9), so Alex is a brimpus.\n\n4. Everything that is snowy, sunny, and a shumpus is a rompus (premise 4) and Alex is sunny (premise 6), so Alex is a rompus.\n\n5. Combining the above conclusions, we can infer that Alex is snowy and sunny because both shumpus and rompus refer to the qualities of snowy and sunny. Alex is also a shumpus because of the combination of fast, moderate, and a yumpus. Therefore, Alex is snowy, sunny, and a shumpus (proof obligation 14)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
