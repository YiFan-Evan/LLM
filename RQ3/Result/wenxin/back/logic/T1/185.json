Based on these facts, we can further infer that Rex is a wumpus or an impus.\n\nStep 3: Next, we must apply the principles of set theory to understand which entities Rex could be. From the premises (4) and (5), we know that brimpuses, wumpuses, and impus are zumpuses or sterpuses or dumpuses or grimpuses or vumpuses. Therefore, Rex could be a grimpus.\n\nStep 4: Finally, we must apply the specific information provided in premise (10) about Rex being a rompus to complete the proof. The fact that Rex is a rompus is a strong piece of evidence to prove that Rex is also a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\"Therefore, from the given premises [(1) Lempuses are shumpuses.
