Introduction of Variables: We need to introduce a new variable 'Stella' to represent the specific person in question.\n\n2. Connecting the Premises: We need to connect the premises to each other using logical relationships like 'is a', 'is not', 'is small', 'is not opaque' etc.\n\n3. Derivation of the Proof:\n\nFrom the premises (1) and (2), we can infer that every gorpus is an impus and every dumpus is a gorpus, hence Stella, as a dumpus, is a gorpus.\n\nFrom the premises (4), (5) and (6), we can infer that every grimpus is not a grimpus, but Stella is a grimpus. Therefore, Stella cannot be a grimpus.\n\nFrom the premises (7), we know that gorpuses are melodic. Since Stella is a gorpus, she is melodic.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can infer that Stella is melodic. \n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions that proves the proof obligation is: [(1), (2), (4), (5), (6), (7) -> (13)] - i.e., the list of propositions [(1) Every gorpus is an impus, (2) Every dumpus is a gorpus, (4) Every grimpus is not a grimpus, (5) Gorpuses are grimpuses, (6) Each dumpus is a lempus, (7) Gorpuses are melodic] proves that Stella is melodic."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
