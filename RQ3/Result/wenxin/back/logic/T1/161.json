[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first explain the fundamental principles involved in solving it, and then provide the answer to the problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Each numpus is hot and a zumpus.

The first premise is that each numpus is hot and a zumpus. This is used to establish that Polly (being a vumpus and a wumpus) must be both hot and a zumpus.\n2. The next premise establishes that vumpuses are sterpuses and wumpuses. Therefore, Polly, as a vumpus, is also a sterpus.\n3. The next premise indicates that gorpuses are tumpuses and dumpuses. Since Polly is already identified as a sterpus, she must also be a gorpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided premises, we can conclude that Polly is a gorpu.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [(1), (5), (8), (9), (10)]->(11)\n\nExplanation: The deduction process begins by identifying the specific properties of Polly based on the premises provided.
