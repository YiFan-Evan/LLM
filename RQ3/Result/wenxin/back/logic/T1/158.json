Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Use the fourth premise to infer that every rompus is a sterpus.\n3. Since Sam is both a wumpus and a rompus (given in the ninth premise), he must also be a sterpus by virtue of the inference above.\n4.
