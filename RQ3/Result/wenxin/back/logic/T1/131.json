Firstly, we need to find out the relevant premises about Sam's attributes. Based on the premises (1), (3), (6), and (7), we know that Sam is either a dumpus or a yumpus, kind or small, slow or a wumpus, and luminous or a yumpus. We also know from the premises (4) and (8) that an opaque or a wumpus is a rompus, and luminous or a wumpus is a lempus. From these premises, we can infer that Sam is a wumpus based on premise (10) and that he is also opaque.\n\nNow, we need to combine these two pieces of information to prove the proof obligation (15). Based on the premises (12) and (13), we know that Sam is luminous and discordant. Since he is also opaque, he must be either a wumpus or a brimpus. Since he is a wumpus according to premise (10), we can infer that he is discordant and a brimpus or a wumpus and discordant. However, since the proof obligation (15) specifically mentions that Sam is discordant and a rompus, we can conclude that he must be discordant and a brimpus. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [(1), (3), (6), (7), (10),(12)]->(15): Sam is discordant and a brimpus. Since Sam is discordant based on premise (14), he must be a brimpus based on premise (9). Since he is also a brimpus, he must be discordant and a brimpus based on the inference from premise (4).
