[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first explain the fundamental principles involved in solving it, and then provide the answer to the problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Tumpuses are gorpuses and impuses.

Prepositional relationships: Based on the given premises, we can establish prepositional relationships between various types of creatures (tumpuses, lorpuses, numpuses, etc.) and objects (cold, gorpuses, impuses, etc.).\n2. Modus Ponens: We can use Modus Ponens to infer conclusions based on the premises and assumptions.\n\nBased on these principles, we can follow the following reasoning steps to prove the statement (10):\n\n1. From the premise (8), we know that Max is a tumpus and a lorpus.\n2. From the premise (2), we know that Lorpuses are rompuses and tumpuses. Therefore, Max is a rompus because he is a tumpus.\n3. From the premise (5), we know that every rompus is a vumpus and a lempus. However, Max is already a tumpus, so he doesn't need to be classified as a vumpus or lempus.
