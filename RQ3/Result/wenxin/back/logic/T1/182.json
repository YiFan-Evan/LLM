This means that Stella must belong to the class of zumpuses. Then, we use the premise that each yumpus is fruity to conclude that Stella is fruity. However, the premise that each zumpus is not transparent implies that Stella is not transparent, as zumpuses belong to a class of creatures that do not possess transparency. Furthermore, we can also use the premise that every dumpus is not happy to rule out that Stella could be happy as a dumpus, given her nature as a zumpus.\n\nTherefore, we have all the pieces we need to complete the proof.\n\nSo, using (1)-(24), we prove (25) Stella is not happy.
