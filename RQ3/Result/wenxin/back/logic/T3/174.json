However, the proposition that Sally is a jompus conflicts with the premise that Sally is a dumpus and a numpus, which suggests that Sally cannot be a wumpus.\n\nSecond, we see that the premise stating that Sally is a shumpus is inconsistent with the claim that Sally is a vumpus, because a shumpus is not a vumpus. Therefore, this proposition proves that Sally cannot be a vumpus, and hence cannot be a wumpus.\n\nThird, we observe that the premises provide no evidence to support the claim that Sally is a wumpus. For example, although Sally is mentioned to be a yumpus and a dumpus, these properties do not imply that she is a wumpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises and derivations, we can conclude that Sally is not a wumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(6),(7),(8),(10),(11),(12)->(14) The premises do not provide any evidence to support the claim that Sally is a wumpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is not a wumpus then Taylor is a visionary.

Then, using the assumption and the other premises, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary because of the following steps:\n\n- Taylor's status as a wumpus is inferred from the premises that wumpuses are yumpuses and grimpuses, gorpus, or rompus are vumpuses. However, since Sally is not a wumpus, Taylor cannot be a wumpus.\n\n- Since Taylor is not a wumpus, it follows from the premise that each shumpus is a vumpus that Taylor is also a vumpus.\n\n- The fact that Sally is a shumpus, which implies that she is also a vumpus, further strengthens Taylor's status as a vumpus.\n\n- Finally, from the premise that everything that is a brimpus or a tumpus is a brimpus and Taylor is a vumpus, it follows that Taylor is also a brimpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises and derivations, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (15) Taylor is a visionary."}]
