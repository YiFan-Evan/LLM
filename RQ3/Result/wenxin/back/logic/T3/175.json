If Sally is not small, then Taylor is a visionary. This is a conditional statement that we can use to infer that Taylor's status as a visionary depends on Sally's size.\n\nCombining these principles, we can infer that if Sally, being a brimpus, is not small, then Taylor, being a jompus, must be a visionary. However, the premises do not explicitly state that Sally is small. Therefore, in order to complete the proof, we need to use other premises or proof obligations to establish that Sally is not small. Once we establish that Sally is not small, then Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTo do this, we need to use the premise (23) \"Brimpuses are windy\" and the fact that Sally is a brimpus to infer that Sally is windy. Then we can use the premise (24) \"Sally is a shumpus\" and the fact that shumpuses are jompuses to infer that Taylor is also a jompus. Finally, we can use the premise (19) \"Each jompus is not small\" to conclude that Taylor is not small and thus Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is based on a set of premises and proof obligations that directly lead to the conclusion without using any additional premises or principles."}]
