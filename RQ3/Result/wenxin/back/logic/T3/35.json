However, since Rex is not a shumpus (according to premise 4), it cannot be an impus or a tumpus. Therefore, the only possibility for Rex is to be a numpus or a brimpus, according to the second and third premises.\n\nSecond, we can use the premise that everything that is a numpus or a brimpus is a gorpus to conclude that Rex is a gorpu.\n\nFinally, since Rex is not a tumpus and a tumpus is also not an impus (the first premise), it follows that Rex cannot be an impus.
