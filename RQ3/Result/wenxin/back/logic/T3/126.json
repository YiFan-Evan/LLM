From (2) and (5), we know that each grimpus is loud and a numpus, and lempuses are floral, gorpuses, and sterpuses. Since Alex is both a grimpus and a lempus, he must be a sterpus.\n\nThe proof is based on the associative property of logical connectives (+, *, and &) and the transitivity of the property of being orange (Orange is a type of vumpus). The inference from (1) to (3) shows that all Numpuses are vumpuses and lempuses, and (6) states that dumpuses are temperate and jompuses and tumpuses.
