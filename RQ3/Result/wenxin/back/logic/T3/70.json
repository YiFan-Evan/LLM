[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Since everything that is a grimpus, a gorpu, or a yumpus is a vumpus, Max is also a vumpus.\n\nThen, we have that Taylor is a visionary because he/she must be the same as Max, and Max is already shown to be a vumpus (i.e., possessing certain characteristics that make him/her an example of such category). Therefore, we can infer that Taylor must also be a vumpus.\n\nNext, since Taylor is already shown to be a vumpus, it follows that Taylor must also be a dumpus because every dumpus is a wumpus.
