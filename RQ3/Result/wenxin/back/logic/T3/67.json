From the premises (2), (5), and (6), we know that everything that is large and small and a grimpus is a gorpus, and everything that is nervous and happy and feisty and shy and a zumpus is a dumpus. Since Polly is both large and small, nervous and happy, feisty and shy, we can infer that she is a gorpus.\n\nFinally, we need to verify that Polly is also blue and orange and brown and red. This can be done by comparing the premises (16), (17), and (19) with the properties of grimpus. The premises clearly state that Polly is windy and snowy, which is exactly what a grimpus is.
