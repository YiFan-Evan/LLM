From the first premise, we know that grimpus or tumpus are yumpus.\n2. From the second premise, we know that wumpus or brimpus are yumpus.\n3. Since we know that Polly is not a yumpus (statement 4), it follows that Polly cannot be a grimpus or a tumpus, nor can she be a wumpus or a brimpus.

Combining the above information, Taylor cannot be a grimpus or a tumpus nor a wumpus or a brimpus (given by premise 4), hence they are both false, thus making Polly a gorpus.\n6.
