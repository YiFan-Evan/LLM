This implies that anything that is transparent or jompus must also be a vumpus, according to the premise (1). Therefore, we have Rex, being a numpus (from premise (10)), as being a tumpus = jompus.\n\nNext, we can combine this with the premise (9) that metallic or tumpus is a yumpus. This means that Rex can also be considered as a yumpus, because he is a tumpus = jompus. Therefore, Rex is transparent or a jompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10), (9)->(12) Rex is a numpus, which in turn means he is a tumpus = jompus.
