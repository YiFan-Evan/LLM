Based on the premises, we know that if Wren is slow, fast, and an impus, then Taylor is a visionary. Additionally, Wren is slow, fast, and an impus, which means that Taylor is a potential visionary. However, we also have to take into account that Taylor's nature (a tumpus) has not been stated in the premises, so it needs to be inferred based on the definitions and the previous premise. With this in mind, we can conclude that the missing premise (15) would read as follows: \"Taylor is a tumpus\". This final inference is consistent with all the given premises and their relationships, and it provides a solid basis for proving that Taylor is indeed a visionary. Therefore, the final answer is: \"Taylor is a visionary.\""}]
