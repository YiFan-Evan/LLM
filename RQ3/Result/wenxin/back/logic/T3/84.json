(2) Alex is a yumpus.\n\nFrom (1) and (2), we can infer that Alex is either large, small, or a yumpus.\n\nUsing the premise \"(3) Everything that is spicy or sour or a rompus is a sterpus\", we can apply transitivity again to infer that if something is spicy or sour or a rompus, then it is a sterpus. Since Alex is a member of this category, we can infer that Alex is a sterpus.\n\nFinally, using the premise \"(4) Everything that is happy, nervous, or a lorpus is a grimpus\", we can apply transitivity once more to infer that if something is happy, nervous, or a lorpus, then it is a grimpus.
