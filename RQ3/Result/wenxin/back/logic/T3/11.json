The first and second premises state that sterpuses and every lorpus are lempus. Since Stella is a sterpus, she is also a lempus.\n2. The fourth and fifth premises suggest that Jompuses are also lempus and that each sterpus is a rompus. This allows us to infer that Stella could be a jompus, thus she could be a rompus.\n3. The seventh premise further suggests that Wumpuses are rompuses.
