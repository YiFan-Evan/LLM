Therefore, Rex, who is a jompus (as stated in premise 11), is also a sterpus by extension. Based on premise (2), we know that everything that is a wumpus, zumpus, or yumpus is a sterpus. Since Rex is both a wumpus and a jompus (see premises 5 and 9), Rex is a sterpus. Next, we take the \"grimpus\" part of the proof obligation from premise (8), which states that each vumpus is a lorpus, and Rex is also a vumpus.
