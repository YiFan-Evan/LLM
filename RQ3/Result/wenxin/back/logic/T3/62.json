[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

A numpus is either metallic or floral or small. (1) and (9) tell us that Wren is both floral and small.\n\n2. Since Wren is both small and floral, Wren is a zumpus. (3) tells us that a zumpus is also a numpus.\n\n3. Furthermore, since Wren is also both small and floral and metallic, and also has the yumpus characteristic, (7) indicates that Wren is both small and large.\n\nTherefore, by following these three premises (which can be interpreted as an induction), we can conclude that Wren is both small and large and a numpus, as requested in the proof obligation."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is small, large, and a numpus then Taylor is a visionary.
