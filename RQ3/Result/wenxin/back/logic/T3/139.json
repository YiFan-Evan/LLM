You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Alex is a tumpus, so according to the fourth premise, Alex is a numpus.\n5. Also, according to the second and seventh premises, we know that anything that is a lorpus and a lempus and a rompus is a numpus, which means Alex is a numpus.\n6. The final step is to use the fourth and fifth premises again, together with the fact that the \"zapus\" is an intermediate step between \"numpus\" and \"zumpus\".
