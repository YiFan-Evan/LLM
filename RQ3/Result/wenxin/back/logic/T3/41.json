Therefore, if Rex is amenable and he is aggressive, mean, angry, and a brimpus, then Taylor must also be aggressive, mean, angry, and a brimpus.\n\n3. Then we apply the second premise, which says that everything that is amenable, aggressive, mean, angry, and a brimpus is a rompus. This tells us that Taylor is a rompus.\n\n4. Finally, we apply the third premise which says that everything that is fruity, floral, earthy, and a brimpus is a lorpus. Therefore, Taylor must also be a lorpus.\n\n5.
