Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

We use the knowledge that impuses are rompuses to infer that Fae is not a red thing, because it belongs to the category of impuses. And then we use the premise (10) that says that impuses are not red to strengthen this inference.\n\nNow we can combine the above inference with the other premises to further prove Fae's colorlessness. Using the premises (4), (5), and (6), we can infer that Yumpuses are not temperate and are either impuses or wumpus. Since Fae is a tumpus, it follows from (4) that Fae is a yumpus. Therefore, Fae cannot be temperate, which means it cannot be red.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, from the given premises we can prove that Fae is not red. \n\n(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (11), (12)->(13)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Fae is not red then Taylor is a visionary.
