From premise (8), Wren is a shumpus.\n4. From premise (9), Wren is sour.\n5. From premise (10), Wren is floral.\n6. From the fact that Wren is sweet, fruity, sour, and a shumpus, we can infer that it is a wumpus.\n7. From the fact that Wren is a wumpus and everything that is a wumpus is a brimpus, we can infer that Wren is a brimpus.\n\nNow that we have established that Wren is a brimpus and a sweet, spicy, sour, and a shumpus, we need to further verify these relationships using other premises:\n\n8. From premise (1) and (3), we know that everything that is temperate and hot and cold and a wumpus is a zumpus. Therefore, if Wren is a brimpus and temperate, hot, and cold (because it is snowy), then it must be a zumpus.\n9. From premise (4), everything that is fruity, earthy, floral, and a rompus is a grimpus. Therefore, if Wren is a brimpus and fruity (because it is fruity), then it must be a grimpus instead of a wumpus.\n10. The above conclusion together with our inference in step 7 rules out Wren being a wumpus. Since we have shown that it cannot be a wumpus and we know it is a brimpus (as established in step 7), then Wren must be a grimpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided premises, the minimal set of premise propositions needed to prove the proof obligation '(17) Wren is sweet, spicy, sour, and a brimpus' are: [(6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (1)] -> (17).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [(6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (1)] -> (17)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is sweet, spicy, sour, and a brimpus then Taylor is a visionary.
