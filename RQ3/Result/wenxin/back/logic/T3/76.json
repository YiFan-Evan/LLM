Then, from the premise (10), we know that Sam is a jompus and a numpus, and from the premise (7), we know that each numpus is a tumpus or a jompus.

Therefore, Taylor is also sunny, a vumpus, and a lorpus.\n\nThirdly, from the premise (3), we know that zumpuses are slow, fast, and wumpuses. Since Taylor is also a zumpus, Taylor is also slow and fast.\n\nFinally, from the premises (4), (5), and (6), we know that shumpuses are large, rompuses, and impuses; each tumpus is feisty, a dumpus, and a gorpus; and each sterpus is loud.
