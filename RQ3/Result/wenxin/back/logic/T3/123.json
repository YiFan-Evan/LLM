You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

From the third premise, we know that shumpuses are impuses and vumpuses.\n3. Therefore, based on the transitivity of \"is\" (if A is B and B is C, then A is C), we can infer that Polly, being a shumpus and a grimpus, is a sterpus.\n4.
