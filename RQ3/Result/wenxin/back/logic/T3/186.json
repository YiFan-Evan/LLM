Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to do it:\n\n1. The first step is to identify the relevant propositions that can lead to the conclusion \"(21) Max is not sour.\" The premises provide information about several different animals and objects, but it's helpful to keep the conclusion in mind to identify the relevant relationships.\n2. The premise \"(9) Vumpuses are not sour\" provides an important piece of information. It suggests that vumpuses (gorpuses) are not sour, which implies that Max, if he's a tumpus (which we know from premise (15)), is not sour.\n3. Next, we need to draw conclusions from the remaining premises. Since sourness is related to other properties mentioned in the premises, we need to use rules of inference to connect these properties to sourness.\n4. From the premise \"(18) Dumpuses are muffled\" and the definition of Max as a tumpus (premise (20)), we can infer that Max is a dumpus.\n5. From the premise \"(9) Vumpuses are not sour\" and the inference above, we can infer that Max is not sour because vumpuses (gorpuses) are not sour and Max is a vumpus.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions that lead to the proof obligation \"(21) Max is not sour.\" is: [(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (15), (18)] -> (21).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nFrom the given premises, we can infer that Max is a tumpus and not sour using the rules of inference provided."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is not sour then Taylor is a visionary.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to do it:\n\n1. The first step is to identify the relevant propositions that can lead to the conclusion \"(22) Taylor is a visionary.\" We have to consider the premise that if Max is not sour then Taylor is a visionary.\n2. Since we have no information about sourness of Taylor, we cannot directly infer that Taylor is a visionary. However, since Max (premise (20)) is not sour (premise (10)), it follows that Taylor (since they are the same person) is also not sour.\n3. Then, we need to use the premise that if Max is not sour then Taylor is a visionary. This premise establishes a relationship between Max's property (not being sour) and Taylor's property (being a visionary).\n4. Therefore, based on the premises and inference rules, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions that lead to the proof obligation \"(22) Taylor is a visionary\" is: [(1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), (10), (20)] -> (22).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nFrom the given premises, using inference rules, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary based on the premise that if Max is not sour then Taylor is a visionary."}]
