From the first premise, we know that if Max is a rompus, then Taylor is a visionary. However, we also know from the third premise that Lorpuses are rompuses and tumpuses, which means that Taylor could also be considered a tumpus or a Lorpus, depending on whether he identifies as such or not. Therefore, it cannot be derived from the premise alone whether Taylor is indeed a rompus or not.\n3.

Based on the above information, it can be inferred that Taylor could be considered one of the following categories: shumpus, numpus, lempus, vumpus, or brimpus/jompus.
