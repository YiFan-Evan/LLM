Start with the given premise (1) which states that \"Every sterpus is dull and a wumpus and a brimpus.\" This implies that if Fae is a sterpus, then she must be dull and also a wumpus or brimpus.\n2. Use premise (4) to know that wumpuses are kind, grimpuses, and gorpus. Therefore, Fae, as a wumpus, must also be kind.\n3. Finally, we can use the last two premises (8) and (9) to conclude that Fae is sweet and a shumpus and a zumpus. This directly supports our conclusion that Fae is a sterpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can prove that Fae is a sterpus.
