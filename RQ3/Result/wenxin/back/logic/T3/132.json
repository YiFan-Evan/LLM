Since Alex is identified as kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus, Taylor is a candidate for being a visionary.\n2. Based on the premise (3), Alex is a vumpus, which implies that he has kind and angry, aggressive and amenable, and also is a lempus.\n3. We already know from the previous step that Taylor is a candidate for being a visionary due to Alex's kindness and aggressiveness. However, to fully prove that Taylor is a visionary, we need to establish that Taylor has other qualities as well.\n4. The premises (4), (5), and (6) tell us that sour, bright and dull, and shy and nervous are all characteristics of tumpus, respectively. Based on these premises, we can infer that Taylor is a tumpus.\n5. Therefore, Taylor is a tumpus and kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and sweet.
