Furthermore, since Alex is a shumpus according to premise 9, we can infer that Alex is also a numpus and a vumpus. Using the definition of dumpus, we know that Alex is a dumpus if he is either a sterpus, impus, or jompus. Therefore, since Alex is already a dumpus, he must also be a sterpus or an impus or a jompus.
