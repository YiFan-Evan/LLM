Start with the premise \"(1) if Wren is not a zumpus and Wren is not a lorpus then Taylor is a visionary.\" This is our starting point.\n2. Since Wren is not a zumpus and Wren is not a lorpus (premise 5), we can apply the \"if and\" condition in the premise to infer that Taylor must be a visionary (step 1).\n3.
