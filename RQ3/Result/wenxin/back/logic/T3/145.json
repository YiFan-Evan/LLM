And since Fae is also a shumpus (premise 8), she must be either a grimpus or a dumpus (because every numpus is a shumpus).\n3. However, we know from the second premise that dumpuses are yumpuses and tumpuses, so Fae cannot be a dumpus.\n4. Therefore, Fae must be a grimpus.\n5. And since Fae is also a grimpus (from the first premise), she must also be a dumpus (because each gorpus is also a dumpus).\n6.
