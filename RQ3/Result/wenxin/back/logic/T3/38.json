Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first explain the fundamental principles involved in solving it, and then provide the answer to the problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is slow and a vumpus is a grimpus.

Stella is a jompus. (13)\n3. Stella is a lempus. (14)\n4. Stella is a tumpus. (18)\n\nFrom (1), (2), and (4), we know that Stella is a grimpus or a wumpus, which are both types of tumpus, thus supporting the claim that Stella is a tumpus. From (15), we know that Stella is red. Then from (7), since everything that is small and a wumpus is a rompus, Stella is a rompus because she is small and a wumpus. Then from (6), we know that everything that is sweet and a lempus is a tumpus, which implies that Stella's temperament must be sweet because she is a lempus. Therefore, Stella is temperate and a vumpus.\n\nExplanation:\n\nTo prove that Stella is temperate and a vumpus, we need to consider the following fundamental principles:\n\n1. If something has certain characteristics, then it can be classified into certain types of objects based on those characteristics.\n2. If something has multiple characteristics, then it can be classified into multiple types of objects based on those characteristics.\n\nBy applying these principles, we can conclude that since Stella is sweet, a jompus, a lempus, and a tumpus, she must also be temperate and a vumpus based on her other characteristics mentioned in the premises. This is because she can be classified as a tumpus due to her temperament and behavior (as explained above), which can be considered a type of wumpus, which is one of the types of vumpus mentioned in the premises."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Stella is temperate and a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
