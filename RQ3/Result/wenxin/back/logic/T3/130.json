We will follow a process of elimination to reach our conclusion.\n\nFrom the premise (1) and (2), we know that everything that is a vumpus (hot, temperate, cold) is a tumpus (liquid and metallic and luminous). Since Sally is a shumpus, she must be a tumpus. However, she is also happy and feisty, which would indicate that she is not just a tumpus but also belongs to other categories. Therefore, Sally cannot be both hot or cold because both these states require external temperature. She is neither purely a shumpus nor purely a tumpus, which makes her shumpus distinct from both the categories.\n\nNow let's go through the other premises to find out if there is any overlap between the shumpus and yumpus categories. The premise (6) says that everything that is slow, moderate, fast, and a dumpus is a yumpus. Sally is indeed slow and belongs to the dumpus category. But she is also happy and feisty, which indicates that she is not just slow but also belongs to other categories. Therefore, Sally cannot be both slow and dumpus because both these states require different qualities.\n\nFrom the premise (4), we know that everything that is a zumpus (happy, feisty) is a yumpus. Therefore, Sally's happiness and feistiness make her a yumpus. The premise (8) says that everything that is floral and fruity and earthy and a zumpus is a numpus. However, Sally's color and quality do not fit into this category, so this does not apply to her.\n\nBased on these premises, we can conclude that Sally's happy, feisty, shy, and colorful qualities indicate that she belongs to the yumpus category. Sally is indeed a yumpus as per the proof obligation (21).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: '(1), (4), (6), (7), (8), (9), (17), (18), (19), (20),->(21)'\n\nThe minimal set of premise propositions necessary to prove the proof obligation (21) are: (1) Everything that is hot, temperate, cold, and a shumpus is a vumpus; (4) Everything that is happy, feisty, shy, and a yumpus is a zumpus; (6) Everything that is slow, moderate, fast, and a dumpus is a yumpus; and (7) Everything that is rainy, windy, snowy, and a tumpus is a rompus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is happy and feisty and shy and a yumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
