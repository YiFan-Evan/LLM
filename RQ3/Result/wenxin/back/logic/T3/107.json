Start with the premise (1), which states that if Sam is dull and a shumpus then Taylor is a visionary. This is our main inference.\n2. From the premise (14) and (15), we know that Sam is both snowy and angry, which in turn can be inferred to mean that Sam is angry and snowy.\n3. Using the premise (16), we know that Sam is a tumpus, which is supported by the previous inference.\n4. Finally, since Sam is a tumpus, he is also a numpus, which is supported by the premise (13).\n5. Combining all these premises, we can infer that Sam is dull and a shumpus.\n\nNow, since Taylor is a visionary if Sam is dull and a shumpus, it follows that Taylor must also be a visionary. Therefore, the proof obligation (18) can be derived from the given premises."}]
