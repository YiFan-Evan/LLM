From the given premises, we can observe that certain classes of objects (spicy, sour, numpus, orange, red, opaque, opaque/transparent, luminous, wooden, earthy, fruity, small/large, muffled, melodic, slow/fast, nervous, shy) are classified as tumpus or zumpus or grumpus or yumpus or vumpus or lempus or sterpus or wumpus or dumpus. Among these classes, Max is identified as a brimpus (premise 12), and based on our understanding of classification systems and further properties related to brimpus (orange and red), we can infer that Max is also a yumpus (premise 2).\n\nBased on the properties of yumpus (opaque/transparent and earthy/fruity), we can further infer that Max is also a vumpus (premise 11). From the properties of vumpus (numpus), we can conclude that Max is also a brimpus because he has already been identified as such. Based on the above inference, we can then identify Max as earthy or fruity or a vumpus based on his classification as a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is derived from the combination of the given premises and the inference drawn from them. The minimal set of premise propositions that proves the proof obligation is (1), (2), and (6) for the classification of Max as a brimpus and (11) for his classification as a vumpus.

From the properties of yumpus (numpus), we can infer that Taylor is also a numpus (premise 7). Based on the properties of numpus and the additional information about Taylor's nature (nervous, shy), we infer that Taylor is also a vumpus (premise 10). The property of vumpus leads to the conclusion that Taylor is also a brimpus.\n\nNow, with the identification of Taylor as both a brimpus and a vumpus, we can use the implication from the premises to conclude that Taylor is also a visionary (premise 1). Therefore, the final answer is derived from the combination of the given premises and the inference drawn from them.
