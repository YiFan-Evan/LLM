From (3) Every lempus is angry and (8) Every numpus is small, we can infer that a lempus (a tumpus) is small and angry, and that a numpus (which could be either a tumpus or a brimpus) is small.\n2. From (7) Grimpuses are vumpuses and (17) Tumpuses are brimpuses, we can infer that a grimpus (which could be either a tumpus or a brimpus) is a vumpus.\n3. From (16) Every zumpus is dull and (6) Dumpuses are zumpuses, we can infer that a dumpus is dull.\n4. From (5) Dumpuses are blue and (15) Every x is liquid, we can infer that blue dumpuses are liquid.\n5.
