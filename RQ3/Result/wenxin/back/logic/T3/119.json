Since we know that each yumpus is large or small or a vumpus or a tumpus, Max must be a yumpus.\n\nNext, we consider the properties of yumpuses. We know that they are described as being both muffled and loud, which implies that they must have both muffled and loud qualities. Since Max is described as both mean and kind, it follows that he must have both muffled and loud qualities.\n\nMoreover, we know that each rompus is sour and bitter and a zumpus and a shumpus.
