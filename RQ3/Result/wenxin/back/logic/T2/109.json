Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Conditional statements: If a statement A implies B, then A is true if and only if B is true.\n\nBased on these principles, we can proceed with the derivation:\n\nFrom the premises (4) and (5), we know that \"every tumpus is a wumpus and yumpuses are not temperate\".

Therefore, Fae cannot be impure or dirty, as impure or dirty impuses would not be roomy enough for a tumpus to be a rompuse.\n\nFinally, from the premises (10) and (11), we know that \"every impus is not red and Fae is a brimpus\".
