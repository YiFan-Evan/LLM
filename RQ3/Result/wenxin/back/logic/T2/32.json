Connecting propositions: Propositions are connected by logical relationships such as \"is a\", \"is\", \"not\", \"every\", etc.\n2. Modus Ponens: If a proposition (P) and its consequent (Q) are both true, then it follows that Q must be true.\n3. Modus Tollens: If a proposition (P) is true but its negation (not-P) is false, then all the related propositions that follow from P must also be true.\n\nFrom the given premises:\n\n(1) Each rompus is a grimpus.\n(2) Every yumpus is a dumpus.\n(3) Rompuses are large.\n(9) Each rompus is a gorpus.\n(21) Grimpuses are bitter.\n\nFrom these premises, we can infer that Polly is a grimpus rompus.\n\n(4) Each vumpus is brown.
