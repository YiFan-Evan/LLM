[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Then, using this inference rule, we can infer that if Max is a vumpus or a lorpus, then Max is a dumpus.\n\nSecond, we know from the premise \"(4) Max is not a dumpus\" that Max cannot be a dumpus. Therefore, using the negation of the above inference rule (i.e., \"If x is a vumpus or a lorpus, then x is not a dumpus\"), we can infer that Max is not a vumpus or a lorpus.\n\nFinally, since we have already shown that Max cannot be a vumpus or a lorpus, and we know from the premise \"(5) Max is not a yumpus\" that Max cannot be a yumpus either, it follows that \"Max is not a lorpus and Max is not a vumpus\".
