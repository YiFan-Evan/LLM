Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Use the fourth premise to infer that every wumpus is an impus or a shumpus.\n3. Use the fifth and sixth premises to infer that vumpuses are rompusises and lorpusises.\n4. From the above inferences, we can infer that Polly is a gorpu because she is both a vumpus and a wumpus, which means she is also a sterpuise, an impus or a shumpus, and a rompusise or a lorpise.
