Based on the third and fourth premises, we can infer that if Sally is a brimpus, then she must be either large or temperate. Since Sally is large (premise 2), we can conclude that Sally is also a vumpus (from the second premise). Finally, since Sally is brown (premise 8), it follows from the sixth premise that Sally must be brown or a vumpus.
