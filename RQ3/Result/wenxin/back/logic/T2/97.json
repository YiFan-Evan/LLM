Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

A premise states that \"Sterpuses are rompuses\" and \"Every gorpus is a jompus and a zumpus.\"\n\n2. Based on the above premises, we can infer that a sterpuse is a jompus or a zumpus.\n\n3. Another premise says that \"Vumpuses are discordant and lorpuses.\" This can be used to infer that a vumpuse is discordant.\n\n4. From the previous inference, we can also infer that a rompus is either discordant or lorpus.\n\n5. A final premise indicates that \"Every yumpus is a dumpus and a gorpus.\" Using this rule, we can infer that Fae, who is both a brimpus and a rompus, must also be a yumpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the above inference chain, we can prove that \"Fae is a yumpus,\" as the final proof obligation requires. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [(1) Sterpuses are rompuses., (2) Every gorpus is a jompus and a zumpus., (6) Zumpuses are wumpuse and tumpuses., (7) Every rompus is a yumpus and a brimpus., (9) Fae is a tumpus and a wumpus., (10) Fae is a brimpus and a rompus. -> (11) Fae is a yumpus.]"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is a brimpus and a rompus.
