The premises provide information about various types of animals (zumpuses, vumpuses, lempuses, etc.) and their relationships.\n2. The premises also provide information about specific individuals (Alex) and their characteristics and relationships with other animals.\n\nTo prove \"(11) Alex is not a brimpus.\", we must follow the steps:\n\n1. Begin with the premise \"(7) Alex is a tumpus.\" and combine it with the premise \"(5) Brimpuses are jompuses and numpuses and zumpuses.\". This shows that Alex is either a brimpus or a tumpus or a numpus or a zumpus.\n2. Use the premise \"(6) Every brimpus is a shumpus.\" to infer that if Alex is a brimpus, he must also be a shumpus.\n3. The premise \"(9) Alex is a wumpus, an impus, and a shumpus.\" already states that Alex has all three of these characteristics, so it cannot also be a brimpus.\n4. The premise \"(8) Each jompus is a grimpus.\" does not apply to Alex because he is not a jompus.\n5. Finally, the premises do not provide any information about Alex being a numpus or a gorpus, which would also rule out the possibility of him being a brimpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that Alex is not a brimpus.
