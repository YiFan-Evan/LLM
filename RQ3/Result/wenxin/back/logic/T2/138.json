Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

The first premise states that \"Everything that is small or a lempus is a brimpus\". Since we know that Sam is a lempus, we can infer that Sam is a brimpus.\n2. The second premise states that \"Everything that is spicy or a lorpus is a dumpus\". However, this premise does not directly apply to our current situation.\n3. The third and fourth premises deal with specific attributes of brimpus, but they do not directly affect our current goal.\n4.
