The first two premises indicate that if something is earthy and a grimpus, it is a gorpus. Since Alex is earthy and a grimpus, it follows that Alex is a gorpus. Then, the sixth premise tells us that Alex is a lempus, which is a necessary condition for something to be feisty. Therefore, Alex is feisty. The third premise indicates that if something is amenable and a lempus, it is a grimpus. Since Alex is amenable and a lempus, it follows that Alex is a grimpus.
