From premise (4), we know that everything that is dull and bright and a lempus is a zumpus. However, Polly is already described as a lempus, so this rule does not apply to Polly directly.\n2. From premise (8), we know that Polly is spicy. This is a different property from being dull, bright, and a lempus.\n3. From premise (9), we know that Polly is a sterpus. This is another property that is different from being dull, bright, and a lempus.\n4. Since Polly is spicy, a sterpus, and dull/bright/lempus, it follows that Polly must also be liquid (from premise (12)).\n5. Finally, from premises (6) and (14), we know that everything that is liquid and luminous and a rompus is a dumpus. Therefore, since Polly is liquid and luminous, it follows that Polly must also be a dumpus.\n\nTherefore, Polly is dull, bright, spicy, a sterpus, liquid, and a dumpus, which implies that she is also a zumpus (from premise (4)). Since there are no other premises that specifically describe Polly as being dull, bright, and a lempus, we can conclude that she must also be one of these creatures.\n\nTherefore, the proof of (16) Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus is complete."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Polly is a rompus.
