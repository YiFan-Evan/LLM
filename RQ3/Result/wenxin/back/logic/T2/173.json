Premise (1) states that each sterpus is a jompus.\n\n2. Premise (4) states that each zumpus is a brimpus.\n\n3. Premise (9) states that grimpuses are brimpuses, implying that there is a one-to-one relationship between grimpuses and brimpuses.\n\n4. We also know from the definitions given in premise (2) and (6) that zumpuses, grimpuses, and impuses belong to a set of related classes of creatures, including tumpuses, yumpuses, and rompuses.\n\n5. Finally, the claim we are trying to prove (15) states that Fae is not a zumpus.\n\nProof:\n\n1. From the fact that Fae is a jompus (premise 9), we can infer that Fae is also a grimpus or an impus, based on the definition of jompus given in premise (2).\n\n2. Since Fae is also a brimpus (from premise 4), we can infer that Fae is a grimpus and an impus.\n\n3. Fae is also a wumpus (from premise 11), so Fae is a member of all three classes mentioned in the definition of jompus (grimpus, zumpus, and wumpus).\n\n4. However, if Fae were a zumpus, then it would also be a brimpus, which contradicts the fact that Fae is also a brimpus as stated in premise 4.
