[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Everything that is rainy or a numpus is a grimpus (premise 1)\n2. Everything that is bright or a jompus is a numpus (premise 2)\n3. Sam is a tumpus (premise 6)\n4.
