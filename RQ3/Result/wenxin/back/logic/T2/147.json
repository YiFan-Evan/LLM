Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Firstly, from the premise (7), we know that everything that is metallic and a shumpus is a grimpus. Secondly, from the premise (9), we know that Max is happy. Combining these two premises, we can infer that Max is happy and metallic because happiness and being metallic are mutually exclusive features of wumpuses, but we have established that Max has both. Then, we use this inference as a basis to draw the conclusion that Max is a shumpus, given that all happy and metallic wumpuses are shumpuses.
