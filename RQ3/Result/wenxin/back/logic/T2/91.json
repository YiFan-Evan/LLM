Here is the proof:\n\n1. From the premises (1) and (2), we know that everything that is large, small, or a yumpus is a wumpus, and everything that is dull, bright, or a rompus is a lempus. Therefore, if Fae is a grimpus (according to premise (12)), it follows that Fae is also a wumpus or lempus.\n\n2. From the premises (3) and (4), we know that everything that is orange or blue or a rompus is a grimpus, and everything that is kind, angry, or a grimpus is a yumpus. Therefore, if Fae is a wumpus or lempus (from the previous step), it follows that Fae is also a yumpus.\n\n3. From the premises (6) and (7), we know that everything that is luminous, metallic, or a yumpus is a vumpus, and everything that is happy, shy, or a jompus is a tumpus. Therefore, if Fae is a yumpus (from the previous step), it follows that Fae could be luminous or metallic or a jompus.\n\n4. The final piece of evidence provided is that Fae is known to be a shumpus (premise (13)). However, whether shumpus refers to sourness or dimness (since both are unremarkable features of wumpians), this can also be equated to a biting one of sourness. Thus, from this piece of evidence it can be inferred that Fae may also be sour.\n\nCombining these steps and pieces of evidence together, we arrive at the conclusion that Fae must be either luminous or metallic or sour and/or happy/shy. However, the given proof obligation asks for something else: \"Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus.\" Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [(1), (2), (3), (4), (6), (7), (13)] -> (14): Fae is luminous or metallic or a yumpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is a shumpus.
