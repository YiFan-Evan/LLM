Each shumpus is not feisty.\n2. Jompuses are shumpuses.\n3. Grimpuses are jompuses.\n4. Every dumpus is an impus.\n5. Every grimpus is aggressive.\n6. Rex is a dumpus.\n\nFrom the first premise, we know that shumpuses are not feisty. From the second and third premises, we know that jompuses are shumpuses and grimpuses are jompuses, which implies that Rex is a grimpus. From the fourth premise, we know that every impus is a dumpus, which means that Rex is a dumpus by another application of the fourth premise.\n\nFrom the fifth premise, we know that grimpuses are aggressive. Therefore, we can infer that Rex is aggressive as well. However, from the sixth premise, we know that Rex is not large (vumpuses are not large), which implies that Rex cannot be a large grimpus (zumpuses).\n\nFrom the seventh premise, we know that vumpuses are not luminous (except for numpuses), so Rex cannot be luminous, nor could he be opaque. Furthermore, from the ninth and tenth premises, we know that brimpuses are yumpuses and every yumpus is impus, which implies that Rex is a brimpus and therefore he is not sunny.\n\nFrom the last three premises, we also know that numpuses are not dull (except for sterpuses), which rules out the possibility of Rex being dull. Since we know Rex is both aggressive and not large (or opaque or slow), it follows that he cannot be feisty (therefore proving the proof obligation).\n\nIn conclusion, using these premises, we have derived all the necessary steps to prove that Rex is not feisty. Therefore, the minimal set of premise propositions required to prove (25) Rex is not feisty is: [(1) Each shumpus is not feisty], [(2), (3), (6) Jompuses are shumpuses; Grimpuses are jompuses; Rex is a dumpus], [(7) Vumpuses are not large], [(8) Brimpuses are not sunny], [(9), (18) Brimpuses are numpuses; Numpuses are not dull], [(10) Every dumpus is an impus], [(11) Every grimpus is aggressive], [(15) Lorpuses are cold], [(16) Sterpuses are numpuses] -> (25) Rex is not feisty."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a dumpus.
