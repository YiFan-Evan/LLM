The third premise, \"Alex is a lempus,\" while not directly related to the conclusion, is crucial in identifying Alex as a member of the category of luminous, liquid, and a lempus, which is included in the category of tumpus. The fourth premise, \"Everything that is small, large, and a dumpus is a gorpus,\" could potentially lead to the conclusion Alex is a gorpus. However, we need to further identify whether Alex is also opaque and a rompus. The fifth premise, \"Everything that is orange, brown, and a dumpus is a jompus,\" does not directly apply to Alex because he is transparent.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that Alex is small (premise 4), large (premise 7), and a dumpus (premise 1) based on the premises given.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [(4) Everything that is small, large, and a dumpus is a gorpus.
