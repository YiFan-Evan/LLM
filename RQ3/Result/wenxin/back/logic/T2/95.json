The principles involved in solving this problem are the definitions of various types of animals and Max's characteristics. Based on these definitions and Max's characteristics, we can infer that Max is either a tumpus (premise 1), a lempus (premise 2 or 3), or a grimpus (premise 9). In addition, it is mentioned that Max is also a wumpus (premise 10). Since a wumpus cannot be any other type of animal, it follows that Max is either blue or orange or a lempus (from the list of animals that are blue or orange or a lempus).
