From the premises (1) and (4), we know that everything that is a lorpus or a gorpus or a grimpus is an impus. Since Rex is a grimpus, it follows that Rex is an impus.\n2. From the premise (7), we know that everything that is a grimpus, a sterpus, or a lempus is a numpus. Therefore, Rex being a grimpus implies that Rex is also a numpus.\n3. From the premise (8), we know that zumpuses are numpuses. Therefore, Rex being a numpus implies that Rex is also a zumpus.\n4. Finally, from the premises (5) and (6), we know that jompuses are a part of every group (lorpus/gorpus/grimpus) and jompuses are impuses, which directly translates to Rex being a member of the jompus group and Rex being an impus, hence a tumpus or a dumpus or a wumpus.\n\nCombining all these deductions together, we arrive at the conclusion that Rex is a tumpus or a dumpus or a wumpus, as per the proof obligation stated in (11)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a jompus.
