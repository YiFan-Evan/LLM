Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Premise (1) tells us that every sterpus is an impus and a vumpus. Therefore, Rex is also an impus and a vumpus.\n2. Premise (4) tells us that each dumpus is a brimpus and a sterpus. Therefore, Rex, as a dumpus, is also a brimpus and a sterpus.\n3. Combining the information from (1) and (4), we can conclude that Rex is an impus and a vumpus, and also a brimpus and a sterpus.\n4. Premise (5) states that lorpuses are dumpuses and wumpuses. Since lorpuses are defined as dumpuses, Rex, as a lorpus, is also a wumpus.\n5.
