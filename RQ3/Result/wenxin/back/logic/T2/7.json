[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

We start with premise (8), which states that Alex is a lorpus and a brimpus. Then, using the fact that every brimpus is a vumpus and a rompus (premise 2), we can infer that Alex is a vumpus and a rompus. Similarly, using the fact that every lorpus is a grimpus and a brimpus (premise 4), we can infer that Alex is also a grimpus. Finally, combining these three pieces of information, we can conclude that Alex is a lorpus.\n\nExplanation: The key to the proof is the use of modus ponens, which allows us to infer conclusions based on premises and their implications. We also rely on the definitions of various terms, such as \"lorpus\" and \"brimpus\", which provide us with additional information about Alex's identity."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is a wumpus and a tumpus.
