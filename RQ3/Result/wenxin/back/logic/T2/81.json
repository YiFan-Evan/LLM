Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Then, using the definition of \"numpus\" in (4), we can infer that Wren is also a tumpus. Furthermore, from (7), we know that every tumpus is also an impus, so Wren is also an impus. Finally, (8) tells us that impuses are zumpuses and grimpuses, so Wren is also a zumpus and a grimpus.
