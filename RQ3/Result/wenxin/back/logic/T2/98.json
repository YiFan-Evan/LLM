Here's the derivation:\n\n1. Sam is happy (premise 13).\n2. Happy people are typically jompus (premise 4).\n3. Therefore, Sam is a jompus (premise 4 is stronger than a mere \"happy\").\n4. Sam is overcast (premise 11), and overcast conditions can refer to having moderate winds (or at least a neutral weather state) as stated in our initial premise 14.\n5.
