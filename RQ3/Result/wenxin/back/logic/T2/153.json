Inference from properties: We can infer the properties of an object based on its relationship with other objects. For example, if we know that everything that is overcast and a dumpus is a lempus, and Alex is overcast, then we can infer that Alex is a lempus.\n\n2. Modus Ponens: If we know that something is true and we know that something implies that thing, then we can infer that the thing is true. For example, if we know that everything that is loud and a tumpus is a jompus, and Alex is loud, then we can infer that Alex is a jompus.\n\nFrom the given premises:\n\n(1) Everything that is sour and a wumpus is an impus.
