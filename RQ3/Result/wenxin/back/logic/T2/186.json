Modus Ponens: If a statement A implies B and B is asserted, then A must be true as well.\n2. Transitivity: If A implies B and B implies C, then A implies C.\n\nFrom the given premises, we can establish the following chain of reasoning:\n\n1. Each gorpus is red. (from premise (14))\n2. Gorpus Max is red. (from premise (18) and (19) Max is a gorpus)\n3. Tumpus Max is red. (from premise (20) and Max is a tumpus)\n4. Tumpus Max is sour (from premise (11) Tumpuses are mean and sourness is a characteristic of many fruits)\n5. Vumpus Max is sour (from premise (6) Vumpuses are yumpuses and the transitivity rule)\n\nFrom this chain of reasoning, we can see that if Max is a tumpus, it follows that he is sour. However, our goal is to prove that Max is not sour, which means we need to find a way to break this chain of reasoning.\n\nSince sourness is not mentioned in any of the other premises, we can conclude that it cannot be inferred from any other source. Therefore, we can safely remove the last inference regarding sourness and keep only the ones stated above.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can prove that Max is not sour.
