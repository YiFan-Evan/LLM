From the first premise, we know that yumpuses are sterpuses and jompuses. Sally, as a jompus and sterpus, is therefore also a yumpus. From the sixth premise, we know that vumpuses are grimpuses and lorpuses, and rompuses are vumpuses and gorpuses. Therefore, Sally's yumpus status implies that she is also a grimpus and lorpus, which in turn implies that she is a gorpues. Finally, the third premise provides direct evidence of Sally's gorpues identity by stating that Sally is a jompus and sterpus, which also implies that she is a gorpues.
