The first fundamental principle is the inference rules used in the premises. Based on the premises, we can infer that each impus is a dumpus, that each lorpus is an impus, that each jompus is a tumpus, and that each grimpus is an impus.\n2. The second fundamental principle is the definition of terms. Based on the definitions, we can know that dumpus, lorpin, jompus, grimpus, and vumpus are specific types of corpus.\n3. The third fundamental principle is the conjunction rule of inference, which states that if two or more propositions are logically related, we can infer conclusions based on them. Based on premises (2), (4), (6), and (8), we can infer that dumpus is lorpus, that tumpus is a lorpin, and that each lorpin is an impus.\n4. Using these inference rules, we can now construct a chain of reasoning to prove the proposition (25) Rex is sweet.\n\nFrom the premises (1), (2), (4), and (7), we know that each lorpin is not transparent and that dumpus is fruity. Therefore, Rex being a numpus implies that Rex is fruity and not transparent.\n\nFrom the premises (17) and (20), we know that each grimpus is sweet and that Lempuses are vumpuses. Since Rex is a grimpus, it follows that Rex is sweet.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [(1),(2),(4),(7),(17),(20) -> (25)]. The minimal set of premise propositions that proves the proof obligation (25) Rex is sweet are: (1) Numpuses are rompuses, (2) Each impus is a dumpus, (4) Dumpuses are lorpuses, (7) Every lorpin is not transparent, and (17) Impuses are sweet."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a numpus.
