Start with the premises (1) Polly is a tumpus, (2) Polly is muffled, and (3) Polly is melodic.\n2. From these premises, we can infer that Polly is musical.\n3. Using the premise (4) Polly is temperate, combined with the inference in step 2, we can infer that Polly is not extremely cold.\n4. Based on the premise (5) Polly is cold and the inference in step 3, we can infer that Polly is not temperate.\n5. From the premises (8) Everything that is snowy, overcast, and a lorpus is a rompus and (18) Polly is moderate, fast, and a wumpus, we can infer that Polly is snowy and overcast.\n6. Since we know that Polly is not extremely cold and not temperate, we can infer from the premise (6) Everything that is kind and mean and a wumpus is a vumpus that Polly is not kind or mean.\n7. Since we know that Polly is not kind or mean and also is snowy and overcast, we can infer that Polly is mean.\n8. Combining this inference with the premise (16) Polly is cold and again with step 5's inference, we can infer that Polly is not cold or mean.\n9. Finally, since we know that Polly is not cold or mean and also is a tumpus, we can infer that she must be fast and moderate.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nTherefore, from the given premises, we can prove that Polly is moderate, fast, and a wumpus.
