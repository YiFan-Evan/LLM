Based on the given premises, we can infer that Wren is an impus and an amenable grimpus. Since Wren is described as being angry, mean, and aggressive in the premises, we can further infer that Wren is also a dumpus. Additionally, Wren is described as being bright and muffled in the premises, which further supports the conclusion that Wren is a dumpus. Finally, since everything that is discordant and melodic is a lempus in premise 4, we can conclude that Wren is also a lempus.
