Classification: The premises provide information about different types of creatures (e.g., brimpuses, tumpuses, grimpuses, etc.) and their relationships. We need to use these classifications to identify the specific properties of Max.\n\n2. Modus Ponens: We use this logical rule to prove statements that are self-evident or directly inferred from premises.\n\nBased on the given premises, here's the proof process and resulting set of premises:\n\n1. From the statement \"(7) Max is a grimpus\" and the premise \"(17) Max is a brimpus\", we can infer that Max is a grimpus of a brimpus type.\n2. From the statement \"(18) Max is a brimpus\" and the premise \"(16) Max is a sterpus\", we can infer that Max is a brimpus of a sterpus type.\n3. From the statement \"(14) Rompuses are jompuses\" and the previous inference, we can infer that Max's brimpus is a jompus.\n4. From the statement \"(2) Every tumpus is a numpus\" and the inference that Max's jompus is a tumpus, we can infer that Max is a numpus.\n5.
