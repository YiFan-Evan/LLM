Then, we use premise (2) to show that gorpuses are lorpuses and wumpuses. Since Fae is a gorpus, she is also a lorpus.\n\n3. From premise (3), we know that impuses are metallic and sterpuses. Since Fae is a lorpus, she must also be a sterpus.\n\n4. From the combination of the above two premises, we can infer that Fae is a grimpus and a sterpus.\n\n5. Finally, we use premise (7) to show that each grimpus is a yumpus and a tumpus. Since Fae is already shown to be both a grimpus and a sterpus, she must also be a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we can conclude that Fae is a grimpus, as asserted in the proof obligation (10).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: [(1), (2), (3), (7) -> (10)] Fae is a grimpus."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is a zumpus and a shumpus.
