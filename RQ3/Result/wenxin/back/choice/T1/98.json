Practice is required over and over again in order to perform well in a big game. This is supported by the context of the question where they had a theory of what they could do and they would repeatedly do it over and over again. \"Practise\" does not mean \"the practical\" or \"a fact\", which are unrelated to the question. \"Park\" is not relevant to the question at all. Therefore, the answer is B. Practice."}]
