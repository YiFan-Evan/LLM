Therefore, the final answer is: B. having friends.\n\nThe question is asking about the reason why someone who is outgoing finds making friends easy. The answer E, friendship, is not a valid answer because it does not explain why making friends is easy for someone who is outgoing. The answer A, scary, is also incorrect because it does not explain why making friends would be easy for someone who is outgoing. The answer D, conflict, and C, good feeling, are both related to personal feelings and not related to the reason why making friends would be easy for someone who is outgoing. Therefore, the only valid answer is B, having friends."}]
