Therefore, the answer is \"A. much\".\n\nThe other options provided in the question are not commonly used to describe the opposite of a little. \"Big\" is a size or quantity term, but it does not have an opposite term that directly fits the context. \"More\" is used to indicate an additional amount or degree, but it does not have a direct opposite term. \"Plenty\" is a synonym of \"a lot\", but it does not provide an exact opposite of \"little\". \"Lot of\" can be used as a substitute for a large amount, but it doesn't provide a direct opposite term for \"little\"."}]
