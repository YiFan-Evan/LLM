A basketball with a hole but not losing its general shape is punctured, as it is not functioning correctly for playing purposes.

As stated in the question, a basketball with a hole but not losing its general shape is punctured, as it is not functioning correctly for playing purposes. Punctured means a small hole is present and this is different from a general hole that might be for the player's convenience. The hole could also be there due to other reasons, like someone using it as a bat, so the question needs to know if this condition affects its nature. Since it's a small hole and it does not change the shape of the basketball, it's still round. If it was not round, it would be different from what it is now. So, the answer is A. punctured."}]
