This is because reasonable demands are fair and equitable agreements that are likely to be accepted by the other party, leading to an end to the strike. More money, not going to work, and return to work are not valid conditions for ending the strike, as they do not constitute fair or equitable agreements. The union itself is not a condition that directly affects the outcome of the strike."}]
