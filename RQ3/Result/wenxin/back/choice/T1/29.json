The list of supplies provided by the student includes paper and pencils, which are common items needed for schoolwork. If a parent is going to purchase these items for their child, they would likely go to a store, as this is the location where most goods are sold and one can easily find items like paper and pencils.

Store.\n\nExplanation above. According to the list of supplies, it includes paper and pencils, which are commonly needed items for schoolwork. Therefore, a parent would likely go to a store to purchase these items.\n\nIn contrast, the other options do not seem to make sense. The cabinet is not a suitable place for purchasing school supplies, and a backpack would only contain the items temporarily without giving them access to store supplies. A classroom is the location of the class itself and would not be a good place for purchasing school supplies. The parking garage does not seem to have anything to do with this question. Therefore, the only answer that makes sense is C. Store."}]
