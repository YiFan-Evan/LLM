A basement is a lower level of a building that is typically used for storage or other purposes.

The basement of an office building can typically be accessed with an elevator, which allows easy access to and from the building's lower levels. This is different from other options like own house, which is typically a single-family home and would not typically have an elevator to access the basement. Similarly, a church and a closet do not have an elevator, while eat cake is clearly incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is \u201cD. office building\u201d."}]
