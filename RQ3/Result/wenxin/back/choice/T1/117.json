Sick person.\n\nThe man had a fear of illness, so he never visited friends who were sick. If someone is sick, they are not able to take care of themselves and may need help and support. If a person is sick, they are likely to be in the hospital or have recovered from an illness, but they are still sick. Graveyards and elderly people do not represent illness, and doctors' offices are not related to fear of illness. Therefore, the correct answer is A. Sick person."}]
