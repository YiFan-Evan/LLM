Therefore, the final answer is: B. making new friends. Going to a party in a new town is an opportunity to meet new people and make connections with them, which is the main goal of socializing. Getting drunk, doing drugs, and setting home are not related to making new friends. New contacts could be achieved through meeting new people and establishing relationships with them, but it is not the only reason for going to a party.\n\nExplanation of each option:\n\n* A. Getting drunk: This is not the main reason for going to a party in a new town. While alcohol may be consumed, it is not the primary focus of making connections with other people.\n* C. New contacts: This is a correct option, but it is not the only reason for going to a party. Making new friends is also a reason for going to a party, and it is more inclusive of other reasons such as socializing and having fun.\n* D. Doing drugs: This is not a reason for going to a party, as it is illegal and can have negative effects on one's health and social life.\n* E. Set home: Going to a new town does not imply that you are moving your home there, so this option is not applicable here.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B. making new friends."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: If you're going to a party in a new town what are you hoping to make?\nOptions: E. set home D. doing drugs C. new contacts B. making new friends A. getting drunk"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation of the correct answer:\n\nThe correct answer is B.

Agetting drunk and Ddoing drugs are not healthy or legal ways of meeting people and establishing relationships. Cnew contacts can be achieved through meeting new people, but it is not necessarily the primary goal of going to a party.
