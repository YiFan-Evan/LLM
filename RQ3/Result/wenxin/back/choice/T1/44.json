Nest. Birds typically build nests to lay eggs and raise their young, so they tend to make their homes in suitable nesting sites. Roofs and forests are not suitable nesting sites for most birds, while leaves may be suitable for some birds, but not as a primary nesting site. The sky is not a place where birds typically make their homes. Therefore, the most logical choice is a nest."}]
