Killing people can cause strong emotions of fear, disgust, sadness, etc., but not joy. If someone kills people, it usually indicates guilt or remorse and it should not give rise to feelings of pleasure or satisfaction. It may result in fear and remorse.\n\nExplanation: the emotion of joy is an incorrect option because it does not seem to fit with the idea of killing people. Going to prison is also incorrect because it does not represent an appropriate reaction or emotion for the situation. Vengeance, although a human emotion, does not fit well with the context of killing people because it can lead to more violence and pain. The emotion of terrible is appropriate because it reflects the horror and sadness that killing people can generate."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Killing people should not cause what emotion?\nOptions: E. terrible D. afraid C. joy B. going to prison A. vengeance"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Explanation:\n\t\tIn the given question, it is stated that killing people should not cause any emotion.
