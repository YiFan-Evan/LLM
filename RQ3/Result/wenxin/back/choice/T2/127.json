Machines can perform work that humans cannot do. Machines have a highly developed technology and precision machinery that allow them to perform tasks that are beyond the ability of humans, such as precision machining, heavy lifting, and assembly work. On the other hand, humans have limitations in terms of physical strength, endurance, and dexterity that limit their ability to perform certain tasks.
