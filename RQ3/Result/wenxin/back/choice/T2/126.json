When meeting a child for the first time, it is typical to introduce yourself and ask the child their name. This establishes a foundation for future communication and helps to establish a sense of trust and rapport between the adult and child. Counting to ten or asking questions are not relevant answers for this question, as they do not contribute to the overall objective of the interaction.
