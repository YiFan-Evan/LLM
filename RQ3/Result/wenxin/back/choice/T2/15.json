In most cases, it grows in large bodies of water such as oceans or seas, which are surrounded by land masses and contain the nutrients necessary for seaweed growth. Therefore, the final answer is: E. Ocean. \n\nThis answer is based on the fact that seaweed is a type of algae that is usually found in large bodies of water such as oceans or seas. Therefore, it is more likely to be found alive in the ocean where it can grow and thrive in the nutrient-rich water. \n\nBeach is a relatively small body of water that is often sandy and has a limited amount of nutrients for seaweed growth. Also, it is often dead seaweed that is washed up on the beach, not live seaweed. Therefore, it is not the correct answer. \n\nFound in sea and found in ocean are synonymous and do not provide any additional information about where seaweed is usually found alive. \n\nWater is a general term that does not provide any specific information about where seaweed grows. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is E. Ocean."}]
