A reusable shopping bag should be stored at home, where it can be easily accessed for future use. This is because home is the most convenient location for storing items that are regularly used and will be needed again in the future. The other options are incorrect because they do not provide a suitable storage location for a reusable shopping bag. A supermarket is not a suitable location for storing a reusable shopping bag because it is designed for quick shopping and does not have space for storing items that are not bought. A mart is a wholesale market and is not suitable for storing personal items like a reusable shopping bag. Obesity is an illness and not a suitable location for storing items. Closet is also not a suitable location for storing a reusable shopping bag because it is designed for storing personal items that are regularly used, but are not frequently needed.
