If the engine cannot be restarted during this period, the airplane will gradually approach a stall condition as it loses altitude and speed. A stall occurs when an aircraft reaches insufficient forward velocity and becomes decelerated to such a degree that the airflow over its wings is insufficient to generate lift, causing it to lose altitude and stability. Therefore, the final answer is A.stall."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\nOptions: A. speed up B. crash C. taxi D. start melting E. stall"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When an airplane engine cuts off and is unable to be restarted in flight, the airplane may experience a stall. A stall occurs when an aircraft loses forward velocity and becomes decelerated to such a degree that the airflow over its wings is insufficient to generate lift, causing it to lose altitude and stability. As the airplane slows down due to aerodynamic drag and loses altitude, it is at risk of hitting the ground if there is no control over the descent. Therefore, the final answer is E. stall and crash."}]
