The correct answer is D. A hard-to-read note is likely to be on a sheet of paper (i.e., sheet music), which is commonly used by musicians. It is written in a condensed font and in a way that is difficult to understand, making it hard to read. Medical charts, beds, and desks are not likely to have notes written on them that are hard to read. Therefore, the final answer is: D. Sheet music."}]
