Call each other.\n\nWhen friends need each other's help, they usually call each other to communicate and ask for assistance. Call each other is the most appropriate response as it reflects the true nature of a friend, which is to help and support each other. Other options like parting company, meeting for lunch, or understanding each other do not reflect the true essence of a friend relationship. The friend who is seeking help should also call their friend back and discuss what can be done to assist in resolving the issue. Therefore, calling each other is the most likely course of action for friends seeking assistance from each other."}]
