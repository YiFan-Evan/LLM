To find his balance, he can either go to the bank to talk to a teller or check his account online through an automated teller machine (ATM).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. Automatic Teller Machine.\n\nATM is the correct term for an automatic teller machine. Slot machines are games of chance and do not provide banking services. Ticket machines are usually for ticket purchases, not banking services. The bank machine option mentioned in the question does not fit into the scenario, because card balance checking cannot be done using a bank machine alone. Hence, it was just an option mentioned incorrectly.\n\nTo clarify: he may also go to a nearby bank or call his bank and they will be able to provide him with the balance. Therefore, I recommend you select D as it provides more clarity in this case."}]
