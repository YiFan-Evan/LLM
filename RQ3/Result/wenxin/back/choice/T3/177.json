(Since the woman was in a dimly lit area like a subway tunnel and potentially friendless, she may have felt vulnerable and motivated to get rid of the stranger as a means of protecting herself. Additionally, the word \"gynocrat\" may suggest a desire to assert power or control over men, further supporting the idea of wanting to eliminate the stranger. Lastly, the word \"give_birth\" could indicate a desire to protect herself and potential offspring from harm.
