Based on the given information, the person wanted lodging in a specific location, so that he was already where he needed to be. Based on the options, the correct answer is a big city, as it is a common place where lodging options are available. A yurt, resort area, and Michigan are not large enough to provide lodging to accommodate someone who wants to be in a certain location. Going on vacation is an event that doesn't describe the location of lodging required by the person.
