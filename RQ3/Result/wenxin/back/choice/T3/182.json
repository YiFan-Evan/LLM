It can be a byproduct of increased cardiovascular function or increased body temperature during exercise. If you are sweating excessively, it may indicate a lack of hydration or excessive exertion that may affect your health negatively. Therefore, sweating should not be the only reason for exercising."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is main benefit to exercising?
