It's not mentioned anywhere in the options where the race track is located. This tells us that it is most likely that the racetrack is somewhere in a region that has apple trees, so they would be close to someplace that is culturally significant. Therefore, based on this, we can narrow down the options to two.\n\nAmong the provided options, Maryland and New Jersey do not have apple trees in their landscapes. They also don't have large scale race tracks nearby, while Indy has been a place where they hold such events and it is culturally significant in that sense. Hence, Indy would be the most likely answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B.
