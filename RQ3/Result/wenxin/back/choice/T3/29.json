The student has a list of supplies like paper and pencils, which implies that they need to purchase these items. Therefore, their parent would have to take them to a store to purchase these items.\n \nTherefore, the final answer is: C. Store. \n \nThe reason for this is that a store is typically where one can purchase items like paper and pencils.
