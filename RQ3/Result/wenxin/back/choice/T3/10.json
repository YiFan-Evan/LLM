The person tried to reduce his weight with a shrink ray, but he got it backwards and only gained weight. The reason-word \"degrowth\" implies a reduction in size or amount, and the reason-word \"lightness\" suggests a decrease in weight. Since the shrink ray is designed to shrink objects, if someone tried to use it incorrectly and aimed it towards his body, it is not expected to cause weight loss. Hence, it resulted in him gaining weight. Therefore, the final answer is: gain weight."}]
