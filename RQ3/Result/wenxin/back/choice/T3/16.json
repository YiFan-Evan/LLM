Freeway. On freeways, cars travel at very high speeds because they are designed for speed and traffic flows freely. Roads can be narrow and slow-moving, alleyways are usually small and narrow, and parking lots are designed for parking vehicles and not for high-speed travel. Race tracks are designed for high-speed racing and not for normal driving. Therefore, the final answer is: Freeways."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where do cars usually travel at very high speeds?
