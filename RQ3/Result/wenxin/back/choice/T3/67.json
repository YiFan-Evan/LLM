The toll road was mentioned to start in Maine and end in New Hampshire, indicating that it was a road located in the New England region of the United States. No other options such as Massachusetts, New Jersey, or my house, make sense given the question's context. Connecticut is a neighboring state to New Hampshire but not the route of the toll road.

(Since the reason-words \"turnpike\" and \"tollbars\" are associated with roads that require tolls, and \"tollies\" implies toll collectors, it is likely that the toll road mentioned in the question was located in a state that had turnpikes and tolls. Additionally, the reason-word \"new_fossil\" doesn't provide any clear indication of a specific location. However, the reason-word \"thaw\" may suggest a warmer climate like Connecticut, which is more likely to experience spring thaws.
