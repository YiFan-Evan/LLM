The water was cold because it was the middle of winter and he cried out to his crew for help. They couldn't hear him over the sound of the motor. The motor's sound would be louder than a person's crying, causing it to drown out the crew's hearing. Surface of earth and snowflakes do not create enough sound to drown out Joe's cries, while teardrops are an incorrect option in the given scenario. Typhoon is a weather phenomenon, which is not related to the scenario.
