A marriage may end in divorce if there is infidelity or if there is a breakdown in communication and trust. Fidelity refers to a commitment to remain faithful to one's spouse, and it is not directly related to the affair itself. Love is a complex emotion that cannot be equated with a specific action or event. So, the answer is divorce."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: She was in an affair, what did that end upon discovery by her husband?
