(Since \"harbor\" is a place where boats dock and are typically in close proximity to land, it is assumed that there is not a lot of open water to navigate and therefore navigation skills may not be required.

Harbor. In a harbor, there is usually a fixed dock or mooring point where the boat can be moored without the need for navigation skills. The boat can be tied up at this point and left to wait for the next trip or until needed again. The reason why there is no need for navigation skills in a harbor is because it is typically a relatively small area of water with close proximity to land.
