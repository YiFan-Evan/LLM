Fountain pen.\n\nTo write with ink, you typically use a fountain pen. These pens have a reservoir inside that holds ink and allows it to flow through the pen tip to create the writing. A squid is an inedible marine creature, a pencil case is where pencils are kept, a newspaper is a printed publication, and a printer is used to create digital images or text. None of these items are commonly used to write with ink. Therefore, the final answer is: B. Fountain pen."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: what do you fill with ink to write?
