When a species tries to procreate with many individuals, it increases the genetic diversity within the species, which helps it adapt to changing environments and survive. Therefore, the final answer is: \"D. std\". This is because Darwin's theory of natural selection states that genetic variation is essential for survival and adaptability of a species.
