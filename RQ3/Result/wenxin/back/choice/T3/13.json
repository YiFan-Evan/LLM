Sexual intercourse is a natural and healthy act between two consenting adults.\n2.

It is a personal decision that you make together with your spouse based on their desires and boundaries. None of the options given in the question directly answer the question about the outcome of sexual intercourse. If you are considering whether sex before going to bed is a good idea, it is best to communicate with your spouse and make a decision based on your own values and preferences.\n\nA bad dream is a possibility, but it is not a direct consequence of sexual intercourse before going to bed.
