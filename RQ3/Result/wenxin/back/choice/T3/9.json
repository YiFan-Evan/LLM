In this case, \"near\" may suggest a person standing relatively close to the object rising, but it does not answer the question as to where you are in relation to the object itself. \"Fall\" does not make sense in this context, as it implies a downward motion, which is not relevant here. \"Lower\" does not provide an answer to where you are in relation to the object rising, but it does suggest that you are lower than the object.
