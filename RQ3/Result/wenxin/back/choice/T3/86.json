While nausea, death, and illness are potential side effects of eating hamburger, gaining weight is not likely an immediate consequence of eating a hamburger, unless the individual is consuming a large amount of unhealthy food in general. The hamburger itself is generally a healthy food item, and its consumption is not likely to cause immediate weight gain.\n\nExplanation:\n\nEating hamburger does not involve any immediate process that would cause weight gain. The ingredients in a hamburger are generally healthy and are not likely to cause immediate weight gain unless combined with other unhealthy foods or a high-calorie diet. Illness, nausea, and death are all potential consequences of eating unhealthy food, but these are not immediate effects of eating a hamburger, as it is generally considered a healthy food item. Therefore, the final answer is: E. gain weight is the least likely immediate side effect of eating hamburger."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is the least likely immediate side effect of eating hamburger?
