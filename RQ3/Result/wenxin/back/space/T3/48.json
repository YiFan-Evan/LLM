This means you will encounter the Chow Chow, screwdriver, pan flute, ski mask, parachute, military uniform, coucal, Shih Tzu, and dowitcher in that order.\n\n2. Then, you move clockwise by 9 steps. This means you will move through all of the previous items, and you will also encounter the item that follows it on the path (in this case, the dowitcher).\n\n3.
