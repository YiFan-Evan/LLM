The first instruction is to move counter-clockwise by 7 steps. This means that we move from the shield to the totem pole.\n\nThe next instruction is to move clockwise by 1 step. This means that we stay at the totem pole and move one step to the right, to the Rottweiler.\n\nFinally, the last instruction is to move counter-clockwise by 8 steps.
