The path is circular, so when you move around the ring, you will always return to the same point.\n\n2. The steps you take determine how far you move around the path.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the specific situation:\n\nStarting from the snow leopard, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. This means you move 9 steps away from the snow leopard and towards the orange.\n\nThen, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. This means you move 3 steps towards the orange from where you were just now.\n\nFinally, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction and you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction. These movements will take you back to where you started from (the orange).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: You will find an orange."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
