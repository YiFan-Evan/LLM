The path is a circular ring, so when you move around it, you will always come back to the same point.\n2. You start from the planetarium and move clockwise for 6 steps, then move counterclockwise for 10 steps.\n\nTherefore, based on the given information, here's what you will find:\n\nStarting from the planetarium, you move clockwise for 6 steps, which takes you to the grey wolf. Then you move counterclockwise for 10 steps, which takes you to the koala. After that, you move clockwise for another 6 steps, which brings you back to the starting point of the path.
