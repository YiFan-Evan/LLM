Moving in a clockwise direction from the pajamas, you start with a macaw.\n2. Then, moving around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction, you land on the llama.\n3. After that, moving clockwise by 5 steps, you land on the overskirt.\n\nAfter you move around clockwise by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction, you end up with the overskirt.
