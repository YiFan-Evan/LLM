Moving clockwise from the mobile home, you encounter various items on the path, including a speaker, a confectionery store, a radiator, a scooter, a lab coat, a European garden spider, a bassinet, a plectrum, a Wire Fox Terrier, a pufferfish, a paddle, an armadillo, a jellyfish, an Asian elephant, a monitor, an airship, and a lorikeet.\n\nYour movements are divided into two phases: clockwise and counterclockwise. In the clockwise phase, you move 12 steps. In the counterclockwise phase, you also move 12 steps in the opposite direction.\n\nTherefore, we need to consider two separate paths: one clockwise and one counterclockwise. We also need to consider the order in which you encounter the items on the path as you move.\n\nBased on this information, we can now answer the question.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: You will find a Wire Fox Terrier on the path after your movements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
