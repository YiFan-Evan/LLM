First, we need to understand the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem.\n\n1. Starting from the top pizza, we move clockwise along the path and encounter a hook, a chambered nautilus, a warthog, and a trombone in that order.\n\n2. Then, we move counter-clockwise from the warthog by 2 steps and then move clockwise by 3 steps. This means that we have covered a distance of 5 steps clockwise from the pizza to reach our current position at the warthog, and then we move counter-clockwise by 2 steps to our next position and then move clockwise by 3 steps to our final position.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: you will find a rainbow at your current position on the path.
