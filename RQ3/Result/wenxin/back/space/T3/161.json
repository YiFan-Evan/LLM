We move counter-clockwise by 1 step, which takes us to a Toy Poodle.\n\n3. Then we move clockwise by 6 steps, which takes us to a washing machine.\n\n4. After that, we move clockwise by 19 steps, which takes us to an acorn squash.\n\n5. Finally, we move clockwise by 17 steps, which brings us to a Staffordshire Bull Terrier.\n\nNow that we have identified our current item, we need to determine what it is that we will find. Based on our movements, we have traveled through a wide range of items, and ultimately arrived at a dog that is commonly known as a Staffordshire Bull Terrier.
