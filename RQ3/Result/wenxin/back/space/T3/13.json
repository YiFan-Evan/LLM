Therefore, we need to keep track of our position and movements to determine where we end up.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. Start from the sulphur-crested cockatoo.\n2. Move clockwise 4 steps.\n3. Then move counter-clockwise 5 steps.\n\nThe total steps taken are 4 + (-5) = -1.\n\nSince we are moving counter-clockwise, we will end up on the opposite side of the path, which is the jigsaw puzzle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: a jigsaw puzzle."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
