The path is a circular one, so when you move around it, you will always return to the same point.\n2. When you move clockwise from the cradle, you take 2 steps and then move 3 steps. This means that you move a total of 5 steps clockwise from the cradle.\n\nNow, let's consider your position after moving around the path. You start from the cradle, take 2 steps clockwise, and then take 3 steps clockwise.
