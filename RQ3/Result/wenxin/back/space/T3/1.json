Moving clockwise increases your proximity to the items on the path, while moving counter-clockwise decreases it.\n\nSo, let's go through the sequence of items encountered on the path:\n\n1. Swimsuit: We start from this item and move clockwise 8 steps.\n2. Earth star: Upon moving clockwise, we encounter the earth star because it is located directly clockwise from the swimsuit after 8 steps.\n3. Angora rabbit: After moving counter-clockwise for 2 steps, we arrive at the Angora rabbit.\n4. Shower cap: After moving clockwise again, we encounter the shower cap because it is directly clockwise from the Angora rabbit after 2 steps.\n5. Tusker: We end up back at the tusker.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The shower cap."}]
