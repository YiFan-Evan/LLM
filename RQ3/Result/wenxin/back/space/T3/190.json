The path is circular, so when you move around it, you always move in a counter-clockwise direction.\n2. You start from the top dot, which is the dot with the tricycle.\n3. You move around the path in a certain number of steps, which changes depending on the item you are moving to.\n\nNow, based on the provided information, let's calculate your movements and what you will find at each step:\n\n1. Starting from the top dot with the tricycle, you move counter-clockwise 13 steps, which takes you to the mosque.\n2. From the mosque, you move counter-clockwise 15 steps, which takes you to the trench coat.\n3. From the trench coat, you move clockwise 8 steps, which brings you to the hot dog.\n4. From the hot dog, you move counter-clockwise 13 steps, which takes you to the stove.\n5. From the stove, you move clockwise 13 steps, which brings you to the platypus.\n6. From the platypus, you move clockwise 13 steps again, which takes you to the espresso.\n7. From the espresso, you move counter-clockwise 15 steps, which takes you to the snow leopard.\n8.
