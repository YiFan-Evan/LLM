We are moving clockwise around a circular path, and each step is either 18, 9, 14, or 13 steps.\n\nWith this information, we can follow the movements to determine where we end up at the end of each round.\n\nMoving clockwise from the radiator (the starting point), we move around the path in a clockwise direction. This takes us to the billiard table, then the pencil case, then the butternut squash, and so on until we reach the sunscreen.\n\nNow, we move clockwise around the path again for 18 steps. This takes us to the forklift, then the toilet seat, then the flamingo, and so on until we reach the weasel.\n\nNext, we move counter-clockwise around the path for 9 steps, which takes us to the corkscrew.\n\nFinally, we move clockwise around the path again for 14 steps counter-clockwise and then clockwise for 13 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\nNow that we have followed these movements, where do we end up? We end up at the sunscreen again!\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Sunscreen.\n\nSo you will find a sunscreen at your current position after following these movements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
