Therefore, the solution to this question requires understanding the specific rules of movement and how these rules affect our final destination.\n\nThe starting position is at the top of the path, where we find a crate. Moving clockwise from the crate, we encounter the following items: shoe store, snowplow, sidewinder, monastery, vault, grasshopper, paper towel, crossword, and sundial.\n\nStarting from the paper towel, we move clockwise by 7 steps. This means that we will move to the crossword, which is 7 steps away from the paper towel.\n\nThen, we move clockwise by 10 steps. This will take us to the sundial, which is 10 steps away from the crossword.\n\nNow, we need to consider how these moves affect our position on the map. Since we started at the top of the path and moved clockwise, our position will continue to move clockwise as we move around the map.
