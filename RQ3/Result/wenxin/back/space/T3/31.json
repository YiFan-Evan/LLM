In this case, moving counter-clockwise means moving away from the golf ball and towards the chambered nautilus. Therefore, if you take 3 steps counter-clockwise, you will move towards the chambered nautilus by 3 steps.\n\nIf you then move clockwise, you will move towards the bagel. However, since you have already moved counter-clockwise 3 steps, you will now be closer to the bagel than you were before moving clockwise. Therefore, moving clockwise will only bring you closer to the bagel by 2 steps.\n\nNow let's consider the position of the items after moving counter-clockwise and clockwise. We know that at the start, you were positioned on the top dot and were facing the Border Collie. The Border Collie is directly to your left. Then there is a bagel directly to your right. After moving counter-clockwise 3 steps, you will now be directly to your left of the chambered nautilus.\n\nAfter moving clockwise, you will now be directly to your left of the bagel. The bagel is directly below the chambered nautilus, so moving clockwise 5 steps will take you towards the border collie, which is directly below you (the position you started from).\n\nTherefore, your final position after moving clockwise 5 steps and counter-clockwise 3 steps will be directly below the Border Collie.
