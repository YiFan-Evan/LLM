The path is a circular map, so when you move around the ring, you will always come back to the same point.\n\n2. The starting position is at the top of the path, which means you start from the hard disk drive.\n\n3. You move clockwise from the hard disk drive, so the items on the path are in a certain order.\n\n4. You move counter-clockwise after each move, which means you encounter each item in the path in a certain sequence and distance.\n\nTherefore, let's take a look at your movements:\n\n1. You move 6 steps counter-clockwise from the African bush elephant, which takes you to the box turtle.\n\n2.
