We move clockwise 5 steps to the beaker (dot 2). Then, we move counter-clockwise 12 steps to the Vizsla (dot 3). After that, we move clockwise 5 more steps to the assault rifle (dot 4). And finally, we move counter-clockwise 3 steps to the library (dot 5).\n\nNow, let's see what we have found:\n\n* The acorn is still at the top of the path, so it's still within our reach.\n* The Egyptian Mau is at dot 6, which is a 6th of the way around the path clockwise from our current position (dot 5). This means we're at a different spot than where we started, but not far away.\n* The beaker is next to the Egyptian Mau.\n* The croquet ball is next to the beaker.\n* The oscilloscope is next to the croquet ball.\n* The Vizsla is still at dot 3, but it's now closer to our current position than it was before.\n* The assault rifle is now at dot 7, which is a 7th of the way around the path clockwise from our current position.\n* The wok is at dot 8, which is a further 8th of the way around the path clockwise from our current position.\n* The chain mail is at dot 9, which is a further 9th of the way around the path clockwise from our current position.\n* The castle is at dot 10, which is a further 10th of the way around the path clockwise from our current position.\n* The poke bonnet is at dot 11, which is a further 11th of the way around the path clockwise from our current position.\n* The mosque is at dot 12, which is a further 12th of the way around the path counter-clockwise from our current position.\n* The sea anemone is now at dot 13, which is on the other side of the path from where we started and on a different section than the rest of the items.\n* The cowboy boot is now at dot 14.\n* The go-kart is now at dot 15.\n* The paper knife is now at dot 16.\n* The baseball player is now at dot 17.\n* The radiator is now at dot 18.\n\nSo after following these instructions, we have reached the library (dot 5), which is our final destination.
