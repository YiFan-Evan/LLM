The movements are all in a counter-clockwise direction, which means that we are moving away from the starting position and towards the items on the path.\n\n2. The movements are cumulative, so each additional movement adds to our distance from the starting position.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the problem and determine what item we will find after each movement:\n\n1. Starting from the football helmet, we move around the ring by 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Therefore, after this movement, we will be closer to the Cocker Spaniels.\n\n2. Then, we move around the ring by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. After this movement, we will be closer to the Dungeness crab.\n\n3.
