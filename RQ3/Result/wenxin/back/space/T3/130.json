Let's start by explaining the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. The path is circular, so we need to move in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction to navigate around it.\n\n2. We start from the top dot, which is where the Boston Terrier is located.\n\n3. We move around the path in steps of 1, 6, and 12, so we need to keep track of our position as we move.\n\nNow let's apply these principles to the specific instructions given to us:\n\n1. Starting from the apron, we move clockwise by 1 step. This means we move to the next dot on the path, which is the lens cap.\n\n2. Then we move clockwise by 6 steps. This takes us to the mortar.\n\n3. Finally, we move counter-clockwise by 12 steps.
