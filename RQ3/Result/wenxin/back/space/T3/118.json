The path is circular, so when you move around it, you will always come back to the same point.\n2. Your initial position is on the top dot, which means you start from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\n3. You move in a counter-clockwise direction when moving around the path.\n\nNow let's apply these principles to the given movements:\n\n1. Moving clockwise by 5 steps: This means you move 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, which will take you to the fiddler crab.\n2. Moving counter-clockwise by 7 steps: This means you move 7 steps clockwise, which will take you to the cheeseburger.\n3. Moving counter-clockwise by 3 steps: This will take you back to the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: You will find a cheeseburger."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
