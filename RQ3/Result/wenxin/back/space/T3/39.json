In order to move, you have to move exactly 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the current position. If you move beyond the end of the path, you will be returned to the beginning of the path. Therefore, when we talk about a '5 steps' move, it is crucial to know where the 'start' of your movement is located.\n\nSo let's go back to our map: at the top, you find a stretcher. Starting from this, you move clockwise around the path in 5 steps to reach the hartebeest. Then, you move another 5 steps clockwise to reach the Saluki, and so on.\n\nNow, moving clockwise from the Saluki, you will find a necklace.
