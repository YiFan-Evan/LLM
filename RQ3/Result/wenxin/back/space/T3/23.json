Then you move counter-clockwise 4 steps, which takes you back to the starting point where you were positioned before moving in a clockwise direction.\n\nNow let's consider the movements you take in a counter-clockwise direction. Since you start from the same point as before, moving counter-clockwise in this direction will take you around the circle in a counter-clockwise direction, which means you will pass by the sock and the bee.\n\nTherefore, based on the above steps, your final position will be directly above the bee.
