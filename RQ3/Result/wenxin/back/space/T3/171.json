We are given a circular path with a certain sequence of items, and we need to follow specific movements to reach a certain position on the path. Each movement affects our position and direction, and we need to consider these factors to reach our final destination.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the given situation and determine the final item we find.\n\nStarting from the orangutan, we move counter-clockwise for 18 steps, which takes us to the conch. Then, we move clockwise for 2 steps, which takes us to the tarantula. After that, we move counter-clockwise for 13 steps, which takes us to the German Shorthaired Pointer. Finally, we move clockwise for 17 steps, which brings us back to the orangutan.\n\nTherefore, based on these movements, we end up with the German Shorthaired Pointer as our final destination.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The German Shorthaired Pointer."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
