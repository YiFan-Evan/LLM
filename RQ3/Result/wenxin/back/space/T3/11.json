The clock is followed by an African wild dog, a Standard Schnauzer, a shower cap, and a Boston Terrier.\n\nTo move counterclockwise, we will take 3 steps from the Standard Schnauzer. After that, we will encounter the shower cap. Then, we take 2 steps in the counterclockwise direction to reach the Boston Terrier.\n\nNow, let's consider the movements you have described.
