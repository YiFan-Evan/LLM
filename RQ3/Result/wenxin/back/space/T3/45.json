The path is a circular object, and moving clockwise or counterclockwise has no impact on the location of the items on the path.\n2. When moving around the path, we take into account the distance moved and the direction of the movement.\n\nNow let's consider the specific movements given:\n\n1. Moving counterclockwise by 4 steps will take you from the Dobermann to the shoe store.\n2. Then moving counterclockwise by 3 steps will take you from the shoe store to the Komondor.\n3. Finally, moving counterclockwise by 2 steps will take you from the Komondor to the bittern.\n\nTherefore, based on these movements, the final destination you will reach is \"bittern\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"bittern\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.

However, when moving counterclockwise by 8 steps from the Dobermann, you would reach the Komondor (after moving through the shoe store and a couple of other spots). Then moving counterclockwise by 4 steps from the Komondor would still take you to the same spot - the Komondor. It is not clear from the provided information where you are supposed to move next.
