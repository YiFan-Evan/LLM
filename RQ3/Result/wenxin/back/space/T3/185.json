The map is circular, so when we move around it, we are always moving in a clockwise direction.\n\n2. The movements you have specified are all clockwise or counterclockwise, so you will be moving around the map in a specific order.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the specific problem and find out what you will find:\n\nStarting from the tiger beetle, you move clockwise 17 steps, which takes you to the planetarium.\n\nThen, you move clockwise 2 steps to the overskirt.\n\nNext, you move counterclockwise 7 steps to the dowitcher.\n\nFinally, you move counterclockwise 14 steps to the black-footed ferret.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: black-footed ferret.\n\nRemember that your movements and positions on the map are determined by the instructions you have been given, and that your final destination is determined by following these instructions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
