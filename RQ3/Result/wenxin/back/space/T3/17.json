Moving clockwise from the ocean liner, we have the fox squirrel, bassinet, square academic cap, and remote control. Starting from the square academic cap, we move clockwise by 5 steps.\n\nNow, based on these principles, we can determine what you will find after moving clockwise by 5 steps from the square academic cap.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: a letter opener.
