The circular path is composed of 10 connected dots, with a mosquito net located at the top dot.\n2. We start moving from the platypus and take three steps clockwise, followed by one step clockwise and one step counterclockwise.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, our movements will be:\n\n1. Starting from the mosquito net, we move clockwise to the water tower.\n2. Then, we take one step clockwise to the platypus.\n3.
