You start from a specific dot on the path, which is located at the top of the path and contains a chest.\n2. You move clockwise and counterclockwise to encounter different items on the path.\n3. You move 11 steps in each direction, so you will encounter a total of 22 items.\n\nNow, let's consider the specific movements you make:\n\nStarting from the European garden spider, you move counterclockwise for 11 steps.
