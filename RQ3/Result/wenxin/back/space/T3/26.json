The circular path is divided into four elements: a Welsh Springer Spaniel, a tiger, a velvet, and a switch. These elements are connected in a clockwise direction starting from the Welsh Springer Spaniel. When you move counter-clockwise by 2 steps and clockwise by 5 steps, you will follow the path and encounter each element in order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: the stopwatch.\n\nSince you started at the top of the path and moved counter-clockwise by 2 steps, you encountered the tiger and then moved clockwise by 5 steps to encounter the velvet and switch in order.
