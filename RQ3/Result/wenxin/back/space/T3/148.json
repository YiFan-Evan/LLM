Start from the top dot, which is the scooter.\n2. Move clockwise along the path.\n3. Count 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Pickelhaube.\n4. Report what you find at that position.\n\nFundamental Principles:\n\n1. We start from the scooter, which is located at the top of the path.\n2. We move clockwise around the path to locate each item.\n3.
