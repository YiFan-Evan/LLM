We start from the top dot, which is occupied by a siamang.\n\n3. We move clockwise around the path, following the instructions given to us.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the specific situation:\n\n1. Starting from the European polecat, we move clockwise 5 steps, which takes us to the yawl.\n\n2. Then, we move clockwise 18 steps, which takes us to the common squirrel monkey.\n\n3.
