In this case, we start from the top dot, where we find a pencil sharpener. We then move clockwise to the next item, which is a fireboat. Then we move counter-clockwise to the next item, which is a warthog. After that, we move clockwise to the next item, which is a shield. And so on until we reach the Chihuahua.\n\nSecondly, we need to keep track of our steps in each direction. In this case, we move clockwise 15 steps, counter-clockwise 6 steps, and clockwise 17 steps before reaching the green mamba.\n\nNow that we have these principles, we can answer the question.
