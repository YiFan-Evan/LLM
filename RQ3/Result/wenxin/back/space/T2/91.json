First, we need to understand the fundamental principles involved in solving this question.\n\nThe circular path is divided into 10 connected dots, and each dot represents a different item. We start from the top dot, which is a Pekingese. Moving clockwise from the Pekingese, we encounter the following items: eraser, crash helmet, face powder, cucumber, swing, tricycle, ping-pong ball, loupe, and snoek.\n\nNow, we need to follow the movements given to us. Starting from the ping-pong ball, we move clockwise by 5 steps, then by 7 steps, and finally by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: you will find a loupe.
