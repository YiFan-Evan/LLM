Counterclockwise movement: 7 steps.\n\nWhen we apply these rules to your starting position (oxygen mask), we can determine where you will end up after each move.\n\nAfter moving clockwise 8 steps, you will be at the small white dot.\n\nThen, moving counterclockwise 6 steps will take you to the monarch butterfly.\n\nNext, moving clockwise 17 steps will take you to the wall clock.\n\nFinally, moving counterclockwise 7 steps will take you to the military uniform.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: military uniform.\n\nSo, after your movements, you will find the military uniform on the circular path."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
