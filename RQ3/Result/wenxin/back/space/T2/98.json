You said \"starting from the American dipper\" and then you specified moves in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. This seems to indicate that you're moving counterclockwise for 2 steps and then moving clockwise for 8 steps. Then you said \"you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction,\" which could suggest you're moving clockwise instead of counterclockwise. To clarify this ambiguity, please confirm which direction you're moving first and then provide instructions accordingly. If you need more help with the specifics of the map moves, feel free to provide additional details about it and I'll be happy to assist further."}]
