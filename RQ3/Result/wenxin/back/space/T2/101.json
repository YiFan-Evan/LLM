Next, we move counter-clockwise 6 steps, which takes us to the alligator lizard. After that, we move clockwise one more time, which brings us to the hippopotamus.\n\nAt this point, we have completed the instructions given to us by the game. We have gone around the circle a total of 15 steps (5 + 4 + 6).\n\nNow, we need to determine what item we land on next.
