The path is a circular one, so when you move around it, you are essentially moving in a circular motion.\n2. Your initial position is at the top of the path, where you find a table lamp.\n3. You move clockwise for 3 steps and counterclockwise for 4 steps.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the specific situation and answer the question.\n\nWhen you move clockwise for 3 steps, you will encounter the scooter. Then, when you move counterclockwise for 4 steps, you will reach the vending machine. After that, you will encounter the unicycle, and finally the typewriter keyboard. Therefore, the final answer is: typewriter keyboard."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
