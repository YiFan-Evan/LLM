Starting from the tree frog, you move clockwise to the unicycle.\n\nPrinciple: The movement is simply a straight line from one dot to another. You move 2 steps in a clockwise direction, which takes you to the next dot.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The unicycle.\n\n2. From the unicycle, you move clockwise to the red fox.\n\nPrinciple: You continue moving clockwise and pass through each dot in sequence. You move 4 steps in a clockwise direction, which takes you to the next dot.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The red fox.\n\n3. Finally, from the red fox, you move clockwise to the carousel again.\n\nPrinciple: You return to the same dot by moving in a counterclockwise direction. You move 2 steps in a counterclockwise direction, which brings you back to the carousel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The carousel.\n\nIn summary, after these movements you will find the carousel located at the bottom of the circular path."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
