The starting position and item you find at the start determine your starting point and item.\n2. Movements in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction refer to your path around the circular map.\n3. Each step taken will move you closer to or further away from the item you are looking for.\n\nNow, based on the instructions, let's consider the movements and reach a conclusion:\n\nStarting from the common gallinule (the first item on the path), you move clockwise to the Flat-Coated Retriever, then to the bolete, then to the police van, and finally to the bee eater. Then, you move counterclockwise around the ring 2 steps, and then counterclockwise again by 2 steps.\n\nUsing these movements, we can follow your path around the circular map:\n\n1. Common gallinule -> Flat-Coated Retriever -> Bolete -> Police Van -> Bee Eater\n2. Bee Eater -> Move Counterclockwise 2 steps -> Common Gallinule (This brings you back to where you started.)\n\nTherefore, based on these movements, you will find a bee eater on your final stop. \n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Bee Eater."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
