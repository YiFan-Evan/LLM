We are given a circular path with 10 dots and 10 items placed on it. You start from the top dot and have to move clockwise or counterclockwise around the path to find the items. You have specific movements you can make to move around the path, which are: moving clockwise by 2 steps, moving counterclockwise by 4 steps, and moving counterclockwise by 7 steps.\n\nNow, let's apply these movements to the path and see what you will find.\n\nStarting from the gondola, you move clockwise by 2 steps. This takes you to the goldfinch.\n\nThen, you move counterclockwise by 4 steps. This takes you to the hand-held computer.\n\nFinally, you move counterclockwise by 7 steps. This brings you to the Vizsla.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Vizsla.
