Let's go through it step by step:\n\n1. Starting from the Chow Chow, we move clockwise to find a strainer.\n2. Then, moving counter-clockwise, we find a white-headed capuchin.\n3. Moving counter-clockwise again, we encounter a disc brake.\n4. We move clockwise again to find a cougar.\n5. Then, moving counter-clockwise 17 steps, we come to a croquet ball.\n6. Next, moving counter-clockwise 8 steps, we come to a pencil case.\n7. After that, moving clockwise 8 steps, we find a hot dog.\n8. Then, moving counter-clockwise once more, we encounter a Shetland Sheepdog.\n9. Continuing counter-clockwise again, we find a gyromitra.\n10. Now moving clockwise 17 steps in the opposite direction, we reach a microphone.\n11. Then moving clockwise 8 steps again, we come to a scoreboard.\n12. Finally, moving counter-clockwise once more, we find an analog clock.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: An analog clock. \n\nSo you found an analog clock after moving around the circle 33 steps in total (17 steps counter-clockwise and 16 steps clockwise).
