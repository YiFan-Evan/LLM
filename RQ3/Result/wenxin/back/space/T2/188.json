The items on the path are arranged in a circular order, starting from the flamingo.\n\nTo move around the path, you need to take steps in a clockwise direction. The first move is 8 steps, and the second move is 12 steps.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: you will find a Cocker Spaniels. This is because you started from the flamingo and took 8 steps to reach the space bar, then took another 12 steps to reach the Cocker Spaniels.\n\nSo far, you have completed your movements and found a Cocker Spaniels. If you continue to move clockwise around the path, you will encounter other items on the path as well.
