We start from the gas pump and move clockwise to the mosquito net, then move counter-clockwise to the duck, then move clockwise to the Norwich Terrier, and so on.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the problem and find out what we will find:\n\n1. Starting from the gas pump, we move clockwise for 15 steps to reach the mosquito net.\n2. Then, we move counter-clockwise for 12 steps to reach the duck.\n3. From the duck, we move clockwise for 19 steps and we find ourselves back at the gas pump.\n4.
