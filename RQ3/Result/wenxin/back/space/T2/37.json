The coyote is our final destination, and it is at this point that we need to move in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise) in order to find the next item.\n\nNow, moving counter-clockwise from the coyote, we have to take 2 steps in the same direction (clockwise) to find our next item.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: you will find the poncho after moving counter-clockwise from the coyote by 2 steps.\n\nNow let's see what you actually found: The answer given is \"the poncho\".
