You start at the top of the path, which is the gossamer-winged butterfly. Moving clockwise from the butterfly, you encounter a goblet, a volcano, a tiger, and a weasel.\n\nAfter moving counter-clockwise around the ring by 4 steps, you end up at the volcano. Then, you move counter-clockwise around the ring by 3 steps, which takes you to the tiger.\n\nNow, we need to consider the movements of each item on the path. The goblet stays in place, but the volcano moves counter-clockwise by 4 steps, which takes it to the tiger. The tiger then moves counter-clockwise by 3 steps, which takes it to the weasel.\n\nTherefore, after moving counter-clockwise by 3 steps from the tiger, you end up at the weasel. You find a gossamer-winged butterfly at the bottom of the path, which is located directly opposite you.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: a gossamer-winged butterfly."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.

Therefore, after moving clockwise by 3 steps from the goblet, you will end up back at the goblet. Therefore, the final answer is: the goblet."}]
