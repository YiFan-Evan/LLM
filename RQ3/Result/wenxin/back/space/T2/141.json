The instructions tell us to move around the circle in different directions and distances, so we need to keep track of our position and how it changes as we move.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the specific situation given in the question.\n\nStarting from the tent, we move counter-clockwise by 2 steps. This means that we move to the next dot, which is a dung beetle.\n\nFrom there, we move clockwise by 5 steps. This takes us to a Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\n\nThen, we move clockwise by 9 steps. This takes us to a canoe.\n\nFinally, we move counter-clockwise by 8 steps.
