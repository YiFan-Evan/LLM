We move clockwise from the polar bear to find the European green lizard.\n3. We move counter-clockwise from the lizard to find the next item on the path, a cucumber.\n4. We move clockwise from the cucumber to find a wool.\n5. We move clockwise from the wool to find an ice cream.\n6. We move counter-clockwise from the ice cream to find a spindle.\n7. We move clockwise from the spindle to find a binoculars.\n8. We move counter-clockwise from the binoculars to find a cliff dwelling.\n9. Then, moving clockwise, we go 3 steps in the opposite direction to find a submarine.\n10.
