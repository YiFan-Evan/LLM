First, we need to understand the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem.\n\nIn this case, we are given a circular path with 10 connected dots, and we start from the top dot where we find a pencil case. Then, we move clockwise around the path to find other items.\n\nNow, let's follow the instructions given to us:\n\n1. We move clockwise from the pencil case to the Papillon.\n2. Then, we move counter-clockwise from the Papillon to the syringe.\n3. Next, we move clockwise to the station wagon.\n4. Then, we move counter-clockwise from the station wagon to the Miniature Pinscher.\n5. After that, we move clockwise to the oystercatcher.\n6.
