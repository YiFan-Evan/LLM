Moving clockwise for 3 steps, you land on the kite. Moving counter-clockwise again, you encounter the trolleybus, followed by the holster. Moving clockwise for 7 steps, you arrive at the banjo. Moving clockwise for 11 steps, you reach the lighter. Then, moving counter-clockwise for 9 steps, you encounter the Siamese cat.\n\nFrom here, you continue moving clockwise to the baboon, followed by the red panda. Then you move counter-clockwise around the ring by 9 steps to land on the dishwasher. Continuing clockwise, you encounter the chain-link fence, followed by the tripod. Then you move counter-clockwise again for 7 steps to reach the damselfly.\n\nFinally, moving clockwise for 3 more steps, you arrive at the burrito.
