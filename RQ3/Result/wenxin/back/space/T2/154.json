Then, you move clockwise by 20 steps, which takes you to the pole.\n\nNow, let's consider the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem:\n\n1. The path is circular, so when you move around it, you always move in a clockwise direction.\n2. The movements you have described are discrete steps, so you move to the next item on the path after completing each step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: the paddle wheel.
