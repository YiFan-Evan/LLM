When we move clockwise or counterclockwise, we should take into account the distance we move and the direction we go.\n\nSecondly, we need to know the locations of the items on the path. Based on the description, we know that the four-poster bed is the starting point, and there are four items on the path: a French horn, a perfume, a strainer, and a ruffed grouse.\n\nNow let's apply these principles to the problem.\n\nStarting from the four-poster bed, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. This means you move to the next dot on the path. Based on the description, the next dot after the four-poster bed is the French horn.\n\nThen you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction.
