The map is a circular one, with 20 dots connected in a clockwise direction. At the start, you are positioned on the top dot, which contains a chest. After moving clockwise from the chest, you encounter a series of items in order until you reach the opposite side of the path again. The path you follow has 21 steps total, of which 11 are in a counter-clockwise direction and 11 are in a clockwise direction.\n\nTherefore, based on these principles, we can now answer the question:\n\nStarting from the European garden spider, you move around the ring by 11 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 11 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\nTherefore, moving in a clockwise direction from the European garden spider, you will find the shopping cart after 11 steps and the black-footed ferret after another 11 steps. In total, you will have gone around the circle twice, encountering these two items in order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: You will find a shopping cart and a black-footed ferret after moving around the circle in this way."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
