Each movement has a certain distance and direction, and these movements will change our position on the path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer will depend on the specific movements we follow.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the specific movements:\n\n1. Move clockwise 9 steps.\n2. Move clockwise 4 steps.\n3. Move clockwise 16 steps.\n\nBased on these movements, we will end up at a different position on the path. However, we don't know where exactly we will end up until we take these steps.\n\nAfter moving clockwise 9 steps, we will be at the Arctic fox. Then we move clockwise 4 steps to find the gazelle.
