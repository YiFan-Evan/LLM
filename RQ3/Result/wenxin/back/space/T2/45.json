The path is a circular map, so any movement you make will return you to the same position after a certain amount of time.\n2. The items on the path are distributed in a certain order, starting from the top dot.\n\nNow let's move on to the specific steps you took:\n\n1. You started from the Dobermann and moved counter-clockwise 4 steps.\n2. You then moved counter-clockwise 3 steps and,\n3. You moved counter-clockwise 2 steps.\n\nThese movements will take you through the following items in order:\n\n1. Dobermann\n2. Komondor\n3. Shoe store\n4. Bittern\n5. Otter\n6. Military aircraft\n7.
