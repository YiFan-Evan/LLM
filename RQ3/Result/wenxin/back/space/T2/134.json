You move in two different directions and distances to the positions of the common redshank and patas monkey, respectively.\n\nTherefore, based on the provided information, here's what you will find:\n\nStarting from the common redshank, you move counter-clockwise by 16 steps, which means you will land on a position on the path that is 16 steps away from the common redshank. Then, you move counter-clockwise by 20 steps to reach the patas monkey.
