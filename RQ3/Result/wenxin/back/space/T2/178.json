Starting from the European polecat, move clockwise by 15 steps.\n2. Then move counterclockwise by 9 steps.\n3. After that, move clockwise by 14 steps.\n4. Finally, move counterclockwise by 20 steps.\n\nStep by step explanation:\n\n1. European polecat -> 15 steps -> The next item on the path is the cardigan Welsh Corgi.\n2. Counterclockwise 9 steps -> After moving counterclockwise by 9 steps, you will land on the pineapple.\n3. Clockwise 14 steps -> After moving clockwise by 14 steps, you will land on the Border Collie.\n4.
