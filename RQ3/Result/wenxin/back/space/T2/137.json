We pass the rifle, minivan, sink, leopard, hammerhead shark, Ibizan Hound, African bush elephant, red admiral, printer, English Setter, tree frog, rhinoceros beetle, ground beetle, volcano, American lobster, Norwich Terrier, entertainment center, and finally reach the lemon. So far, we have passed 21 items on the path.\n\nNext, we move clockwise around the path for 6 steps. Since we move in a clockwise direction, this means we move to the next item on the path. This would be the tiger shark.\n\nThen we move clockwise around the path for 13 steps. This takes us to the entertainment center.\n\nFinally, we move counter-clockwise around the path for 7 steps. Since we move in a counter-clockwise direction, this means we move back to our previous position from the tiger shark. After this movement, we are back at the tiger shark.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The tiger shark."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
