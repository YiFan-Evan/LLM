You move counter-clockwise around the ring by 3 steps, and then move clockwise by 5 steps.\n\nSo let's start by explaining the fundamental principles involved in solving this problem:\n\n* We need to consider both the clockwise and counter-clockwise movements simultaneously.\n* The movements are cumulative, so each step counts towards the next position.\n\nNow let's apply these principles to the problem and find out what you will find:\n\n1. Starting from the golf ball, you move counter-clockwise by 3 steps: This takes you to the upright piano.\n2.
