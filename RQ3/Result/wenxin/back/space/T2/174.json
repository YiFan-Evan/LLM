From the crate, we move in different directions.\n\nThe instructions tell us to move clockwise by 16 steps, counterclockwise by 19 steps, and counterclockwise by 13 steps, and counterclockwise by 5 steps.

We start from the crate, which is our starting point. We move clockwise by 16 steps, which takes us to a baseball. Then we move counterclockwise by 19 steps, which takes us to a sliding door.
