The circular map represents a series of items that are placed in a certain order around a circle. The goal is to follow the path and move around the circle to find the item that is designated as our target.\n\nNow, let's follow the instructions given to us:\n\n1. Starting from the ruler, we move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction and then in a clockwise direction.\n\nWe need to determine how our movement affects our position and what items we encounter along the way.\n\n2. In counter-clockwise direction, we move clockwise until we reach the pencil sharpener.\n\nWe move counter-clockwise for 3 steps, which takes us to the pencil sharpener.\n\n3. Then we move clockwise again until we reach the espresso machine.\n\nThe second step moves us clockwise to the espresso machine.\n\n4. And then, we go clockwise again until we reach the T-shirt.\n\nThe final step moves us clockwise to the T-shirt.\n\nTherefore, based on our movements, we have encountered the following items in order: ruler, pencil sharpener, espresso machine, and T-shirt.
