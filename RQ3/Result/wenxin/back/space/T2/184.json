The steps we take are important because they determine our position and direction of movement.\n\nNow, based on the provided steps, we will move clockwise around the path and identify the item we will find.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: the jay.\n\nWe start by moving clockwise 13 steps in a clockwise direction, which takes us to the ski mask. Then we move clockwise 10 steps, which puts us next to the bee. After that, we move clockwise 5 steps, which puts us at the fire salamander.
