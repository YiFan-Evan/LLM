Moving counterclockwise will take you towards the sleeping bag, then the brain coral, the prairie grouse, and the mosquito net. However, you cannot go clockwise directly from the pretzel, because moving clockwise is only allowed after completing a counterclockwise move. So after moving counterclockwise one step, you must make a counterclockwise move again before you can make a clockwise move. Therefore, the only items you can encounter in your counterclockwise move are the sleeping bag and mosquito net.
