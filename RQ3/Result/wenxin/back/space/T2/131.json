Afterwards, you move counterclockwise by 2 steps and then clockwise by 9 steps.\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to consider the movements in order. Let's start with the counterclockwise move of 2 steps. This will take you to the next dot on the path. Since we're moving counterclockwise, you'll find the smooth green snake on the next dot. Then, you make your clockwise move of 9 steps, which takes you to the final position - the jar.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The jar.\n\nYou have reached the jar after moving counterclockwise by 2 steps and then clockwise by 9 steps."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

So, I'll rephrase the question with the correct direction.\n\nYou start from the ice cream and move clockwise by 2 steps, then move clockwise by 7 steps, and finally move counterclockwise by 9 steps.
