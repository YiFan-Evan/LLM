The path is a circular map, so any movement around the path will eventually bring you back to where you started.\n2. Your movements are specified as 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, 7 steps in a clockwise direction, and 6 steps in a clockwise direction. These movements should be interpreted as relative to your current position, and do not affect the position of the path as a whole.\n\nNow let's apply these principles to the problem:\n\nStarting from the limousine, you move counter-clockwise for 9 steps, which takes you to the soccer ball. Then you move clockwise for 7 steps, which takes you to the Miniature Poodle. Finally, you move clockwise for 6 steps, which brings you back to the carousel.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: a macaque.
