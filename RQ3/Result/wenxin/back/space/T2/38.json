The path is circular, so when you move around it, you always move in a clockwise direction or counter-clockwise direction.\n\n2. You start from the top dot, which is the tabby cat.\n\n3. You move clockwise for 3 steps and counter-clockwise for 2 steps.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the specific situation and find out what you will find:\n\nWhen you move clockwise for 3 steps, you will pass the bullock cart and reach the tiger.\n\nThen, when you move counter-clockwise for 2 steps, you will return to the tabby cat and move another 3 steps clockwise, which will take you to the custard apple.\n\nFinally, another 2 steps counter-clockwise will take you back to the starting point, where you started from.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: a custard apple."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
