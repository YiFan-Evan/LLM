Moving clockwise from the electric ray, we start moving in the order given.\n2. Then we move counterclockwise from the Maltese 3 steps.\n3. We move clockwise 19 steps, which takes us to the lampshade.\n4. Then we move counterclockwise 13 steps, which takes us to the Border Terrier.\n5. After that, we move clockwise 9 steps, which takes us to the bustard.\n6. Then we move counterclockwise 3 steps, which brings us back to the lampshade.\n7.
