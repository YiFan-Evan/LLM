The circular path is a continuous loop, so moving around it in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction will result in the same sequence of items.\n2. When you move around the path by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, you will pass through each item in turn and arrive at the next item in the sequence.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the specific situation given in the question.\n\nStarting from the pencil sharpener, you move clockwise and pass through the scarf, pencil sharpener, paddle wheel, and viaduct in that order.
