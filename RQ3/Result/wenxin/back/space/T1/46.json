The game is asking us to move around a circular path and find items that are hidden on the path. To do this, we need to follow the instructions given to us by the game and move in a specific direction for a certain number of steps.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the specific situation given to us.\n\nStarting from the sweatshirt, we move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. This means that we move towards the junco and the kit fox.\n\nThen, we move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. This means that we move towards the window shade, the remote control, and the mitten.\n\nFinally, we move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction again. This means that we move towards the lakeshore and the axolotl.\n\nTherefore, based on these movements, we should find the junco and the axolotl after moving around the path in this order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Junco and Axolotl."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
