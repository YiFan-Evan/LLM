The map is a circular one, with 20 dots connected together in a circle. We are positioned at the top dot, which is where the Dutch oven is located. Then, we move clockwise around the map following the given instructions and steps.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the movements given to us:\n\n1. Move 9 steps clockwise\n2. Move 4 steps clockwise\n3. Move 16 steps clockwise\n\nBased on these movements, we will follow the path of dots around the circle. We start at the Arctic fox, which is the first item on the path. Then we move clockwise 9 steps, which takes us to the goldfinch. After that, we move clockwise 4 steps, which takes us to the Standard Schnauzer.
