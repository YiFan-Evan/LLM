Moving clockwise, you encounter a Samoyed, a mud turtle, a butternut squash, and a mask. We also know that moving counter-clockwise from the mud turtle, you move around the ring by 4 steps in the opposite direction.\n\nNow, based on these principles, let's consider the movements you have made:\n\nStarting from the slide rule at the top of the path, you move clockwise to the mud turtle, which is four steps away. Then you move counter-clockwise back to the mud turtle, also four steps away. Therefore, after these two movements, you are back at the slide rule.\n\nBased on these movements, you will find the same items as before: slide rule -> Samoyed -> mud turtle -> butternut squash -> mask.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The same items as before.
