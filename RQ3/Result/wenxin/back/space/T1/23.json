Starting from the top dot, we have a pig, followed by a bee, a sock, a smooth newt, and a Basset Hound. The Basset Hound is the next element on the path.\n\nNow, we need to keep track of our movements on the path. We move clockwise by 3 steps and counterclockwise by 4 steps. So, if we move clockwise by 3 steps, we will reach the smooth newt. If we move counterclockwise by 4 steps, we will reach the sock.
