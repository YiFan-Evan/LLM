The map is a circular arrangement of 20 dots, with each dot representing an item. You start at the top dot, which has a Black and Tan Coonhound. Moving clockwise from the dog, you encounter various items on the path, including a ladle, a submarine, a warthog, etc.\n\nNow, based on your instructions, you move clockwise around the map in two different ways. First, you move counter-clockwise by 11 steps, which brings you to the beaker. Then, you move counter-clockwise by 9 steps. Based on the positions of the items on the map, it seems that you will move towards the ring-tailed lemur and then to the yellow garden spider.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A yellow garden spider.\n\nSo far on your journey you have encountered many interesting items, but it seems that your final destination is the yellow garden spider.
