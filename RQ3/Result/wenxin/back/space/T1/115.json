The starting position is at the top of the path, where we find an ear.\n3. After moving clockwise by 6 steps, we will reach the mantis.\n4. After moving counterclockwise by 8 steps, we will reach the pomegranate.\n5. After moving counterclockwise by 6 more steps, we will reach the threshing machine.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The threshing machine.
