Then you move counterclockwise by 9 steps.\n\nSince this is a counterclockwise movement, the item you find will be the item directly before the last item you were at (i.e., Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier).\n\nTherefore, the final item is: banjo.\n\n3. Finally, you move clockwise by 4 steps.\n\nThis movement will take you back to the same item as before (i.e., banjo).\n\nTherefore, the final item is: knee pad.\n\nIn summary, after moving around the path, you will find a knee pad."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
