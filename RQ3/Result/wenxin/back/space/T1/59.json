Then you move clockwise to encounter different items in the path. You then move counterclockwise to a specific position on the path and perform two movements: clockwise and counterclockwise.\n\nNow let's answer the question.\n\nStarting from the odometer, you move clockwise by 9 steps. Therefore, you will encounter the duck and the tiger.\n\nThen you move counterclockwise by 10 steps.
