The instructions tell us to move clockwise or counterclockwise, and the number of steps we take determines how far we move.\n\nNow let's apply these principles to the specific situation:\n\nStarting from the minibus, we move clockwise for 11 steps, which takes us to the water buffalo. Then we move counterclockwise for 17 steps, which takes us back to the minibus. Finally, we move clockwise for 4 steps, which brings us to the computer mouse.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The computer mouse.\n\nSo, after following the instructions and moving around the path, you will find a computer mouse on the circular map."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
