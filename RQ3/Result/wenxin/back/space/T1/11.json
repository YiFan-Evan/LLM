Moving counterclockwise, we start from the Standard Schnauzer, which moves counterclockwise by 3 steps, and then we move counterclockwise by 2 steps. These movements give us the following sequence of dots: African wild dog, shower cap, Boston Terrier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The Boston Terrier.
