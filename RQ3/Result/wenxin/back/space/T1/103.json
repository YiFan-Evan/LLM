You are directly below a great egret. Then, moving clockwise from the egret, we have the kit fox, Standard Schnauzer, Curly-coated Retriever, smooth green snake, spoonbill, monitor, common squirrel monkey, Basset Hound, and finally a bell pepper.\n\nStarting from the monitor, you move clockwise by 4 steps. This will take you to the Basset Hound. Then you move clockwise by 2 steps, which puts you directly below the Basset Hound.
