Based on the instructions you have been given, you will move clockwise and counter-clockwise around the ring in different directions and steps. To determine where you end up, we need to consider all the instructions together and follow the path of your movements.\n\n1. Starting from the chiton, you move clockwise around the ring by 1 step. This may take you to a different dot on the path, depending on where the chiton is located relative to your current position.\n2. Then, you move counter-clockwise around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. This may take you to a different dot on the path depending on where you are currently located after the previous step.\n3. You move clockwise around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction.
