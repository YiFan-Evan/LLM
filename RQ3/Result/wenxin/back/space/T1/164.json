The path is a circular arrangement of connected dots, and each dot represents an item. Your starting position is on the top dot, which is occupied by a weevil. From there, you need to navigate around the path to reach the item you're looking for.\n\nLet's analyze your movements starting from the pelican:\n\n1. Moving clockwise by 4 steps: You reach the water bottle.\n\n2. Moving counterclockwise by 6 steps: You return to the pelican.\n\n3. Moving counterclockwise by 6 steps: You reach the cradle.\n\n4. Moving counterclockwise by 12 steps: You reach the African wild dog.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The African wild dog is the item you will find after your movements."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
