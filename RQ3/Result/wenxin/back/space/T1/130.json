We start from the item at the top of the path, which is a Boston Terrier.\n\nNow let's apply these principles to the specific instructions given to us:\n\n1. We move clockwise by 1 step from the apron, which means we move to the next item on the path. In this case, that item is a custard apple.\n\n2. We move clockwise by 6 steps, which means we move to 6 positions along the path. In this case, we move to the lens cap.\n\n3. We move counterclockwise by 12 steps, which means we start moving away from the center of the path towards the outer edges. In this case, we move to the common sorrel.\n\n4.
