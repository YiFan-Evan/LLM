Additionally, moving one step in either direction from the pretzel will change which item you encounter next.\n\nNow let's consider the specific situation: starting from the pretzel, moving clockwise will encounter the match, goose, sleeping bag, brain coral, prairie grouse, coffee mug, balance beam, and mosquito net in that order. However, if you move counterclockwise from the pretzel, you will encounter only the mosquito net before reaching the end of the path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: You will find a mosquito net after moving counterclockwise from the pretzel."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
