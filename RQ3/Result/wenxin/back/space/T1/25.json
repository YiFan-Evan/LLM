Then, we are instructed to move counter-clockwise from the chickadee by 5 steps.\n\nNow, let's consider the movements in detail:\n\n1. Starting from the lynx, we move clockwise to the hair spray.\n2. Then, we move clockwise to the chickadee.\n3. Now, we move counter-clockwise 5 steps to the trilobite.\n4.
