Starting from the Lhasa Apso, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction. This means that you will encounter the next item in the circle after moving to the next dot clockwise from the Lhasa Apso.\n2. Then, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. This means that you will encounter 5 dots ahead of the Lhasa Apso in a clockwise direction.\n3. Finally, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. This means that you will return to your original position after moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from where you are now.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the items on the path:\n\nStarting from the Lhasa Apso, you move clockwise and encounter the Shield. Then you move clockwise and encounter the Hare. Then you move counter-clockwise and encounter the Schipperke. Then you move clockwise and encounter the salt shaker. Then you move clockwise and encounter the threshing machine. Then you move counter-clockwise and encounter the Standard Schnauzer. Then you move clockwise and encounter the space bar.
