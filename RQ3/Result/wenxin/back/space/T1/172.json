The circular map is connected and consists of 20 dots, with a starting position at the top dot and a final destination at the Arctic fox dot.\n2. The movement is a clockwise direction from the newt dot, with 20 steps.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: the Desert Grassland Whiptail Lizard.\n\nAfter moving clockwise from the Arctic fox dot for 20 steps, you will reach the Desert Grassland Whiptail Lizard dot."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
