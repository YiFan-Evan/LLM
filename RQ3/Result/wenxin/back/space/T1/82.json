To find the item you are looking for, we need to follow the movements and apply them to the map of the dots. Since you are starting from a bookcase on top of the circular path, the initial position of you is that bookcase. Then you move clockwise along the path in the given sequence to get to each item. \n\nStarting from the conch, you move counter-clockwise by 6 steps. Then you move clockwise by 1 step, and finally you move clockwise by 2 steps. This means that you will encounter each item in the path in a counter-clockwise direction, and then move one step clockwise to get to the next item.\n\nNow, applying these movements to the map, we can see where you will end up after moving around the path. Based on your movements and the order of items on the path, you will find a worm snake after moving around the path 6 steps counter-clockwise, then you will move one step clockwise to get to a kit fox, and finally you will find a hot pot after moving another 2 steps clockwise.
