The path is divided into 10 connected dots, and each dot represents an item. The starting position is at the top of the path, where you find a German Shorthaired Pointer.\n\nNow let's follow the instructions and move around the path:\n\n1. Starting from the academic gown, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nMoving clockwise from the academic gown, you will encounter the carbonara. Therefore, the final answer is: Carbonara.\n\n2. Then you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\n\nMoving counterclockwise from the carbonara, you will encounter the lionfish. Therefore, the final answer is: Lionfish.\n\n3.
