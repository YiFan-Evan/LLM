Starting from the European garden spider, we move counterclockwise for 11 steps.\n2. Then, we move clockwise for 11 steps.\n\nNow, let's consider the items on the map:\n\n1.

Oxygen mask\n\nWhen we start from the European garden spider, moving counterclockwise for 11 steps, we encounter the shopping cart and green iguana, so our current position is at the green iguana (item 19). Then, moving clockwise for 11 steps takes us to the Oxygen Mask (item 20). So far, our movements are consistent with the given instructions, and we have covered a distance of 22 steps total, from chest to oxygen mask (counterclockwise) and from the last position back to chest (clockwise). Therefore, our final destination is at the top of the path where the chest is located again.
