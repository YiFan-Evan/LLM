The map is a circular arrangement of 10 connected dots, with a great egret at the top dot. The elements on the path are listed in the given order, starting from the cocktail shaker.\n\nWhen you move clockwise from the great egret, you encounter a chain-link fence, toilet paper, green iguana, snail, Chow Chow, spaghetti squash, pencil case, and ptarmigan. Then, you move counterclockwise from the cocktail shaker by 2 steps, clockwise by 5 steps, and counterclockwise by 6 steps.\n\nNow, let's apply the movement rules to determine your final position and what you find there.\n\n1. Moving counterclockwise from the great egret by 2 steps puts you closer to the green iguana.\n2. Moving clockwise from the green iguana by 5 steps puts you directly next to the spaghetti squash.\n3. Finally, moving counterclockwise from the spaghetti squash by 6 steps puts you at the bottom dot of the path, directly next to the ptarmigan.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The item you find is a ptarmigan."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
