The path is circular, so you can move clockwise or counterclockwise around it.\n2.

Starting from the home theater, you move clockwise around the path for 18 steps, then counterclockwise for 10 steps, then counterclockwise for 6 steps, and finally clockwise for 19 steps.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: You will find a cheetah.\n\nThis is because you start from the home theater, which is located on the path somewhere between the lampshade and the vulture.
