So, we will now be located on the dot next to the shower curtain.\n\nThen, we move clockwise by 2 steps. This means that we will move 2 steps in the direction of the one we came from. So, we will now be located on the dot directly below the dot where we were before moving counter-clockwise by 6 steps.\n\nFinally, we move counter-clockwise by 5 steps and clockwise by 10 steps. These movements will take us through different items on the map to arrive at our final destination. However, since I don't know the specific items you move through and how you move from one item to another, I cannot give you a specific answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: I don't know what you will find after these movements.
