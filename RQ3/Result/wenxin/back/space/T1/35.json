You start at the Carolina anole, move clockwise to the brown bear, quill, paddle, and marmoset in that order. This means you will pass the brown bear twice, the quill three times, the paddle four times, and the marmoset five times. So far, so good.\n\nWhen you move counter-clockwise around the circle by 5 steps, you will reach a point where you have counted up to 14.
