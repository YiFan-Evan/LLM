First, we need to understand the fundamental principles of moving around the circular path and taking steps in different directions.\n\nMoving clockwise from the bulbul, we have the analog clock, balance beam, toaster, and handkerchief in that order. To move clockwise by 3 steps, we will pass the balance beam and reach the toaster. Then, to move counterclockwise by 4 steps, we will move away from the toaster and pass the handkerchief to reach the last item on the path - the center dot, which is where we start again.\n\nTherefore, based on the given movements, we end up back at the bulbul. Since we start and end at the same location, there is no change in the items we find.
