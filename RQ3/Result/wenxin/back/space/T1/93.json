You move counter-clockwise around the path by 2 steps, and then move clockwise by 2 steps.\n\nFundamental Principles:\n\n1. Moving clockwise around the path will take you to the Bluetick Coonhound, black stork, magnetic compass, broccoli, apiary, bucket, butternut squash, and chimpanzee in order.\n2. Moving counter-clockwise by 2 steps will take you to a position behind the apiary.\n3.
