The map is a circular path with 10 connected dots, and you start from the top dot where a goldfinch is located.\n2. You move clockwise in the path by 2 steps, 9 steps, and counterclockwise by 7 steps.\n\nNow let's apply these principles to the question:\n\nStarting from the goldfinch, you move clockwise by 2 steps, which means you move to the next dot on the path. Continuing clockwise, you encounter a Chow Chow. Then you move clockwise by 9 steps, which takes you to a screwdriver. Moving clockwise again, you find a pan flute, a ski mask, a parachute, a military uniform, a coucal, a Shih Tzu, and finally a dowitcher.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: You will find a coucal."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
