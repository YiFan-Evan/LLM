The movements are all circular, so we need to keep track of our position relative to the starting point.\n2. The movements are all steps, so we need to keep track of the distance covered each time.\n\nNow, let's move around the path in the given order:\n\n1. Starting from the trilobite, we move counter-clockwise 2 steps, which puts us next to the pirate ship.\n2. Then, we move clockwise 5 steps, which puts us on the Griffon Bruxellois.\n3. Next, we move counter-clockwise 2 steps again, which puts us on the traffic sign.\n4. Then, we move clockwise 5 steps again, which puts us on the maraca.\n5. We move counter-clockwise 5 steps, which puts us on the jaguar.\n6. Then, we move clockwise 2 steps, which puts us on the sea slug.\n7.
