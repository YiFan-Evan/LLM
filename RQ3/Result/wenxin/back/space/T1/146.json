First, we need to understand the basic principles involved in solving this problem.\n\nThe instructions tell us to move clockwise and counterclockwise in specific steps. This means that we need to consider the positions of the items on the path and how they will be affected by our movements.\n\nStarting from the oxygen mask, we move clockwise in 8 steps, counterclockwise in 6 steps, and then clockwise in 17 steps. This means that we will encounter items in the following order:\n\n1. Oxygen mask\n2. Small white\n3. Obtain item 3 from item 2\n4. Wall clock\n5. Pillow\n6. Obtain item 6 from item 5\n7. Obtain item 7 from item 6\n8. Snorkel\n\nAt this point, we have encountered all of the items on the path except for the military uniform and the alp.
