Starting from the paper towel, we move clockwise for 5 steps.\n\nTherefore, we end up on the snowmobile.\n\n2. Then, we move counter-clockwise for 10 steps.\n\nThis takes us to the bighorn sheep.\n\nNow that we know our final position, we can answer the question:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: You will find a bighorn sheep."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
