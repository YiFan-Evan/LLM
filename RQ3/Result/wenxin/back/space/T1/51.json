The path is a circular one, so moving around it in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction will always lead to the same destination.\n2. When moving counterclockwise, you take 6 steps, and when moving clockwise, you take 10 steps.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the given situation and see what we find.\n\nStarting from the planetarium, moving counterclockwise for 6 steps will take you to the wardrobe. Then, moving clockwise for 10 steps will take you to the flamingo. Continuing clockwise, you will encounter the grey wolf, the terrapin, the koala, the backpack, and finally the pan flute.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The pan flute.
