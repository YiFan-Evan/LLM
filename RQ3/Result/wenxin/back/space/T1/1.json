You move clockwise 4 steps and counterclockwise 1 step.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the specific situation and find out what you will find:\n\nStarting from the swimsuit, you move clockwise 4 steps, which takes you to the shower cap. Then you move counterclockwise 1 step, which takes you to the Angora rabbit. So far, everything follows the given sequence.\n\nThe next item on the path is the earth star, which is the last item on the path that you haven't visited yet.
