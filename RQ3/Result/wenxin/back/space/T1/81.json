Then, moving clockwise, we encounter the screw, horizontal bar, stupa, computer mouse, pufferfish, sea slug, milk can, Golden Retriever, and nematode.\n\nThen, we move clockwise around the circle 7 steps. This will take us to the computer mouse.\n\nNext, we move counter-clockwise around the circle 9 steps. This will take us to the sea slug.\n\nFinally, we move clockwise around the circle 3 steps.
