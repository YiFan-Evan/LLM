Therefore, you end up directly adjacent to the cucumber.\n\nFrom the cucumber, you move clockwise by 7 steps. This takes you to the swing.\n\nFinally, from the swing, you move counterclockwise by 2 steps. This takes you back to the eraser.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The item you find is an eraser."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
