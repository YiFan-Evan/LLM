We start from the Airedale Terrier and move 3 steps in one direction and 5 steps in the other direction. Therefore, we have to keep track of our position relative to the starting point while moving.\n\nLet's assume that we start at the Airedale Terrier.\n\nStep 1: Move clockwise 3 steps to get to the mop.\nStep 2: Move clockwise 5 steps to get to the prairie grouse.\nStep 3: Move clockwise another 3 steps to get back to the Airedale Terrier.\n\nIn total, we have moved clockwise 3 + 5 + 3 = 11 steps from our starting point. Since we started at the top of the path, we will end up back at the top of the path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: An acoustic guitar.
