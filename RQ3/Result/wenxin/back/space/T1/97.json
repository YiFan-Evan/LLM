We are given a circular path with 10 connected dots, and we need to follow certain movements to find an item at the end. The movements include moving clockwise and counterclockwise, and the steps taken affect our position on the path.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the given situation and find out what we will find at the end.\n\nStarting from the dragonfly, we move counterclockwise for 7 steps. This takes us to the bustard.\n\nThen, we move clockwise for 9 steps, which takes us to the night snake.\n\nFinally, we move counterclockwise for 2 steps, which takes us back to the dragonfly.\n\nTherefore, after these movements, we will find a lipstick at the end of our journey.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: lipstick."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
