The movements are all clockwise or counter-clockwise, and the steps are specified separately for each direction.\n\nb. The positions of the items on the map change according to the movements, and we need to keep track of these changes to determine the final position of each item.\n2.

Then, you move counter-clockwise by 4 steps, which takes you to the hand-held computer.\n\nc.
