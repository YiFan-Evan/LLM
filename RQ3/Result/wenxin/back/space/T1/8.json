Therefore, after moving counter-clockwise, we will land on the chambered nautilus.\n\nNext, moving clockwise from the chambered nautilus, we move by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.

You start from the warthog and proceed clockwise, then counterclockwise, then counterclockwise again, and finally clockwise. Based on these movements, we need to calculate where you will end up after each movement and determine the final destination.\n\nStarting from the warthog, moving clockwise will take you to the chambered nautilus, which is one step away. Then moving counterclockwise will take you to the hook, which is two steps away. After that, moving counterclockwise again will take you to the nautilus again, which is also two steps away.
