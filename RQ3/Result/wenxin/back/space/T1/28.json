Each item has a unique position and moving between items is a function of their relative positions.\n\nSecondly, we need to consider the movements you make in each direction. Specifically, you move counter-clockwise by 3 steps and clockwise by 5 steps.\n\nNow, let's apply these principles to the specific situation.\n\nStarting from the scorpion, you move counter-clockwise by 3 steps. This means you move away from the scorpion and towards the gas pump.\n\nThen, you move clockwise by 5 steps. This takes you towards the nematode, which is located 5 steps clockwise from the scorpion.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: You will find a nematode."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
