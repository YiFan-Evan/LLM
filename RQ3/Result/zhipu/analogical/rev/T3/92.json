Here's a step-by-step application of BFS:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. The queue will hold the nodes to be explored, and the visited set will keep track of the nodes that have already been visited.\\n2. Enqueue the start node (3) and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   - Dequeue a node.\\n   - For each neighbor of this node that has not been visited:\\n     - Mark it as visited.\\n     - Enqueue it.\\n     - Record the node from which it was reached (this is part of reconstructing the path later).\\n4. Once we reach the destination node (6), we can backtrack using the recorded nodes to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nApplying this algorithm to the given graph, we find that the shortest path from node 3 to node 6 is directly from 3 to 6 since there are no other nodes to visit that would make the path shorter.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->6\""}]
