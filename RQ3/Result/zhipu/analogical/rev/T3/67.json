Problem 1: Find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.\\n   - Description: In this scenario, we are tasked with finding the shortest route from node 0 to node 3 within the graph. This will involve traversing through the nodes that directly connect node 0 to node 3 with the least number of edges.\\n   - Solution: The shortest path from node 0 to node 3 is 0->2->3, as there is no direct edge from node 0 to node 3, and node 2 is the intermediate node that provides the shortest connection.\\n\\n2. Problem 2: Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6.\\n   - Description: Here, we need to identify the shortest sequence of nodes from node 1 to node 6. This may involve going through multiple nodes to find the path with the minimum distance.\\n   - Solution: The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is 1->5->6.
