Starting from node 0, we would explore the graph, keeping track of the shortest distance from the start node to each visited node. The path to node 11 would be one of the paths explored. For this example, the shortest path from node 0 to node 11 is: 0->1->3->7->9->11.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 5 to node 12.\\n\\n*Solution 2:*\\nUsing a similar approach as in Problem 1, we would find the shortest path from node 5 to node 12.

The shortest path from node 6 to node 10 is: 6->4->8->2, since there is no direct edge from node 6 to node 10, and we must traverse through node 4 and then to node 8 before reaching node 2, which is connected to node 10.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->4->8->2->10. However, it seems there might be a mistake in the graph description or my understanding of it, as node 2 does not have a direct edge to node 10 according to the given edges. Assuming the graph description is correct and there is an implied edge from node 2 to node 10, the path provided would be the shortest. If there is no such edge, we would need to re-evaluate the graph structure.\""}]
