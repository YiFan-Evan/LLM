Since node 1 is directly connected to node 2, and node 2 is directly connected to node 4, the shortest path would be 1->2->4.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, determine the shortest path from node 3 to node 6.\\n*Solution:* We would apply a shortest path algorithm starting from node 3.

Node 9 is not directly connected to node 10, but node 8 is directly connected to node 10. There is no direct connection from node 0 to node 8, so we need to go through node 6 to node 9 and then to node 8, and finally to node 10.

Using a shortest path algorithm like BFS, we start at node 1 and explore its neighbors. Node 1 has neighbors 7 and 12, but neither of these nodes is directly connected to node 2. However, node 1 is directly connected to node 2, which means the shortest path from node 1 to node 2 is just one edge long.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2\""}]
