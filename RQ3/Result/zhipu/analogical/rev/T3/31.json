For this case, the path would be 1->4->7, as there is no direct edge from 1 to 5, and going through node 4 and then to node 7 (which is connected to node 5) is the shortest path.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 0 to node 7.\\n- **Description:** Starting from the initial node 0, we want to determine the shortest path to reach node 7.\\n- **Solution:** Using a shortest path algorithm, we would find that the shortest path is 0->4->7, as this direct path from node 4 to node 7 is the shortest one available.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 3 to node 5.\\n- **Description:** We need to identify the shortest path from node 3 to node 5 in the given graph.\\n- **Solution:** Applying the shortest path algorithm, we find that the shortest path is 3->6->2->5.
