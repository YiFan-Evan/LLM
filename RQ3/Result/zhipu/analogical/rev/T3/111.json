Starting from node 0, we explore its neighbors and keep track of the shortest path to each node. We would find that the shortest path from node 0 to node 9 is 0->1->8->7->9.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 5 to node 12.\\n- Solution: We would apply a shortest path algorithm again, beginning at node 5. We would explore the nodes 2 and 9 first (since they are directly connected to node 5), and from node 9, we would continue to node 7, and then to node 12. The shortest path from node 5 to node 12 is 5->9->7->12.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 4.\\n- Solution: Using Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS starting from node 2, we would first consider node 3 as the neighbor of node 2. However, there is no direct path from node 3 to node 4, so we would have to backtrack. Instead, we would find that node 2 is connected to node 5, which is not on the direct path to node 4 either. However, by exploring further, we would discover that the shortest path from node 2 to node 4 is 2->5->9->7->10->4.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 11], [0, 1], [1, 8], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 5], [4, 6], [4, 10], [5, 9], [7, 9], [7, 10], [7, 12]]}, the start node: 3, and the destination: 11, we can apply a shortest path algorithm.\\n\\n- Solution: Starting from node 3, we would first consider node 2 as its only neighbor. Since there's no direct edge from node 3 to node 11, we would move to node 2 and look for paths from there.
