To find the shortest path, we need to look for a path that goes through the nodes connected by edges. The shortest path from node 1 to node 2 is 1->3->4->5->2.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [3, 2], [4, 5], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 1\\nDestination: 2\\n\\n**Solution:**\\nHere, there is a direct edge from node 3 to node 2. So, we can reach node 2 from node 1 by first going to node 3 and then to node 2.

Therefore, there is no shortest path; it is impossible to reach node 2 from node 1.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nGiven graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [3, 4], [4, 5], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 1\\nDestination: 2\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 2 can be found by looking for the path with the least number of edges between the two nodes. There is no direct edge from node 1 to node 2. We can go from node 1 to node 3, then to node 4, and finally to node 5, which is connected to node 2.
