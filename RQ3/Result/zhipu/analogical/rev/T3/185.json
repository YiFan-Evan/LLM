Initialize a priority queue (or a set in the case of an unweighted graph) to keep track of the nodes to visit, with node 8 having a distance of 0 and all other nodes having a distance of infinity.\\n2. Set the current node to the node with the smallest distance (initially, this is node 8).\\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the distance through the current node and update the distance if it's shorter than the previously known distance.\\n4.
