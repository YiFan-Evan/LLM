Therefore, the shortest path is 0->3->4.\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 in the given graph.\\nSolution: Using the same shortest path algorithm, we would determine that the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 goes through node 3.

Hence, the shortest path is 4->7.\\n\\nOriginal Problem:\\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 2 to node 5 in the given graph.\\nSolution: Using the shortest path algorithm, we start from node 2 and find that the shortest path to node 5 is a direct edge from node 2 to node 5.
