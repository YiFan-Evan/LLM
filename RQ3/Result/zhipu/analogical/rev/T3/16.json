Starting from node 5, we explore the neighbors, which are nodes 0 and 4. From node 4, we have a direct connection to node 1, and from node 1, we can reach node 3.

However, node 2, which is a neighbor of node 0 through node 4, is directly connected to node 6. Thus, the shortest path is 0->4->2->6.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 7.\\n   - **Description**: Here, we are looking for the shortest route from node 1 to node 7.\\n   - **Solution**: Node 1 is connected to node 3, but there is no direct path to node 7.
