Starting from node 0, we explore all reachable nodes until we reach node 11, keeping track of the shortest path to each node visited.\\n   - **Answer A**: The shortest path from node 0 to node 11 might be 0->3->12->13->9->11, but this depends on the structure of the graph and the actual distances between nodes, which are not provided in the array format.
