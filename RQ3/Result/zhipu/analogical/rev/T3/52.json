Since there are no direct edges connecting node 1 to node 0, we would look for an indirect route. The shortest path would be 1->3 (since 1 is connected to 3), then 3->(some node that connects to 0). However, there is no direct connection from node 3 to node 0. We would have to go back to node 1 and try another path.
