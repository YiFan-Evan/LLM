Node 0 has a direct edge to node 5, which does not lead directly to node 3. However, node 5 has an edge to node 11, and from node 11, there is no direct path to node 3 either.

From node 10, we do not have a direct path to node 6, so we need to explore other nodes. We find that node 10 is connected to node 5, and node 5 is connected to node 11, which is not on the path to node 6 either. However, node 5 is also connected to node 14, and from node 14, there is a direct edge to node 13, which is connected to node 6.

Neither of these nodes has a direct edge to node 7. We explore further and find that node 5 is connected to node 11, and node 11 does not lead to node 7 either. We then backtrack to node 2 and take the edge to node 14. Node 14 is connected to node 7, which is our destination.
