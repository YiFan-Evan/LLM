Let's solve the original problem correctly with the start node 8 and the destination node 4.\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 14], [1, 5], [1, 13], [1, 8], [2, 10], [2, 8], [2, 6], [4, 7], [5, 9], [6, 12], [6, 14], [7, 8], [11, 13]]}, the start node: 8, and the destination: 4, we need to find the shortest path.\\n\\nTo solve this, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS. Starting from node 8, we look for the shortest path to node 4. The edges indicate that node 8 is directly connected to node 7. To reach node 4 from node 7, we can traverse through node 4's direct connection, which is node 7. However, since we are looking for the shortest path from node 8 to node 4, we need to find a connection that does not involve node 7 going back to node 8, as that would not be a shorter path.\\n\\nLooking at the graph, node 4 is directly connected to node 7, which is not helpful since we are starting from node 8. We need to find a connection that will take us closer to node 4 without looping back to node 8. We see that node 7 is connected to node 8, and node 8 has no direct connection to node 4. We need to backtrack and find an alternative route.\\n\\nFrom node 8, we can go back to node 1 (since there's an edge from node 1 to node 8). From node 1, we can go to node 5, and from node 5, we can reach node 9, but none of these nodes are directly connected to node 4. We need to find a node that is connected to both node 8 and node 4. There is no such direct connection in the given graph.\\n\\nHowever, we missed a crucial detail: node 4 is directly connected to node 7. Since we are allowed to use the edges in both directions, we can take the path from node 8 to node 7 and then from node 7 to node 4. This is the shortest path because there are no other nodes that connect node 8 to node 4 directly or through a shorter sequence of connections.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->7->4\""}]
