Starting from node 0, we would explore the neighbors (8, 10, 9) first, and continue from there until we reach node 5.

Starting from node 2, we would follow the path to node 1, and then decide the best path considering the weight of 2 from node 3 to node 6. After following the shortest weighted path, we would find that the shortest path from node 2 to node 13 is 2->1->12->13.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 8 to node 14 in the original graph, assuming all edges have the same weight.\\n*Solution 3:* Using BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm (with equal edge weights), we start from node 8 and explore the neighbors.
