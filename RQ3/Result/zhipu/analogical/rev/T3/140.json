Starting from node 0, we would explore the graph, keeping track of the shortest distance to each node until we reach node 14. The shortest path would be 0->4->5->14.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, determine the shortest path from node 2 to node 13.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nAgain, using a shortest path algorithm, we would begin at node 2 and find the shortest route to node 13.

Since there are no edges connecting any node to node 11 directly or through a series of edges, the path does not exist.

Since node 1 is connected to node 12 and node 12 is connected to node 3, and node 3 is connected to node 7, which is connected to node 8, we can find the path.
