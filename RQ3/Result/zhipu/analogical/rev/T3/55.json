Starting from node 0, we explore the graph level by level until we reach node 5. The shortest path from node 0 to node 5 is 0->6->4->5.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 1 to node 7 in the same graph.\\n- Solution: Again, using a shortest path algorithm, we begin at node 1 and explore the graph. The shortest path from node 1 to node 7 would be 1->5->4->7.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nDetermine the shortest path from node 6 to node 2 in the provided graph.\\n- Solution: Starting from node 6, we apply a shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path to node 2. The shortest path from node 6 to node 2 is 6->0, and since there's no direct edge from 0 to 2, we continue the search. However, in this graph, there is no path from 6 to 2 that does not pass through 0 and then another node.
