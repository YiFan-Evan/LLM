Starting from node 1, we would explore its neighbors and continue until we reach node 7. The path would be: 1->2->3->6->7.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nIn the same graph, determine the shortest path from node 2 to node 4.\\n\\n*Solution:* Using a similar method as above, we would start at node 2, move to node 3 (since there is no direct edge to node 4), and find that there is no path from node 3 to node 4 in this graph. Therefore, the answer would be that there is no path from node 2 to node 4.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 6 to node 4 in the given graph.\\n\\n*Solution:* Starting from node 6, we have a direct edge to node 7 but no direct edge to node 4. We would have to backtrack to node 3 through node 2, and then go to node 4. However, since there is no edge connecting node 2 to node 4 in the provided graph, the path does not exist.
