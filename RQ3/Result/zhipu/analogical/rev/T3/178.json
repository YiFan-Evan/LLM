Starting from node 0, we would traverse the graph, keeping track of the distance to each node, and update the shortest distance when a shorter path is found. Once we reach node 20, we backtrack from the shortest distance array to find the path.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\n- **Description:** Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 19.\\n- **Solution:** Similar to Problem 1, we would apply a shortest path algorithm.
