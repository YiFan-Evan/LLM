Starting at node 0, we would first move to either node 8 or node 12 since those are the only two nodes connected to the starting node. We would then continue to expand outwards until we reach node 13.

From node 1, we can move to node 7. From node 7, we can reach node 12 and then node 6. From node 6, we can reach node 11.

Node 2 is directly connected to node 3, and node 3 is not directly connected to node 5, so we must look for another route. Node 2 is also connected to node 6, which is not directly connected to node 5 either. However, node 6 is connected to node 12, which is connected to node 5.

Node 3 is directly connected to node 2. Node 2 is connected to node 6, which is connected to node 12. However, we don't need to go through node 6 to get to node 12 because node 3 is also directly connected to node 6, and node 6 is directly connected to node 12. Therefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 12 is 3->2->6->12.\\n\\nHowever, upon closer inspection, we see that node 3 is not directly connected to node 12.
