Starting from node 0, we explore the neighbors and keep track of the shortest path to each node until we reach node 5.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, determine the shortest path from node 2 to node 10.\\n*Solution:* Using the same method as above, we start from node 2 and explore its neighbors, updating the shortest path to each node until we reach node 10. We would follow the path through nodes that lead to the shortest route to node 10.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nIf we add an edge between nodes 8 and 11 to the graph, find the shortest path from node 3 to node 12.\\n*Solution:* With the additional edge, we would again use an algorithm like Dijkstra's or BFS to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 12, taking into account the new possible route through node 8 to node 11, which could potentially be shorter than the existing paths.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGiven the graph with nodes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12] and edges [[0, 7], [0, 12], [1, 11], [2, 12], [3, 5], [3, 7], [4, 6], [5, 10], [5, 6], [6, 11], [7, 8], [7, 9]], find the shortest path from node 7 to node 11.\\n\\n*Solution:* We will apply BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm starting from node 7 and keep track of the shortest path until we reach node 11.\\n\\nBy applying BFS or Dijkstra's, we would find that the shortest path from node 7 to node 11 is through node 6.
