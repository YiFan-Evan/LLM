The challenge is to find a path that includes additional nodes to reach the destination node 7.\\n\\n*Solution:* The shortest path from node 3 to node 7 is 3->5, but since there is no direct edge from node 5 to node 7, we have to continue. The next shortest path would be 3->5->2->1->6->7.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 6], [2, 4], [3, 5], [6, 7]]}, find the shortest path from the start node 0 to the destination node 1.\\n\\n*Solution:* Since there is a direct edge from node 0 to node 7, and node 7 is connected to node 1, the shortest path from node 0 to node 1 would be 0->7->1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->7->1\""}]
