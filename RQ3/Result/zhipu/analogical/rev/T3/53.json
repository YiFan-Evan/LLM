Starting from node 0, we explore the neighbors and keep track of the shortest path found to each node. We would find the shortest path from 0 to 5 to be 0->3->6->1->5.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 6], [3, 7]]}\\nStart node: 2\\nDestination: 7\\n\\nSolution:\\nAgain, using a shortest path algorithm, we would find the shortest path from node 2 to node 7 to be 2->4. Since there is no direct connection from 4 to 7, and all paths from 2 to 7 must go through 4, the shortest path is simply 2->4.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 6], [3, 7]]}\\nStart node: 3\\nDestination: 4\\n\\nSolution:\\nFor this problem, we would find that there is no direct path from node 3 to node 4. We would have to go through node 2 to reach node 4. The shortest path from node 3 to node 4 would be 3->2->4.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem with the start node 6 and the destination node 1:\\n\\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS, we would find the shortest path from node 6 to node 1. Starting from node 6, we would explore the neighbors (1, 2, 3, 7) and find that the shortest path to node 1 is through node 5, which connects to node 1.
