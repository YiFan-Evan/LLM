Starting from node 0, we would explore the edges to nodes 3, 4, and 5. From those nodes, we would continue to explore until we reach node 7. The shortest path might be 0->3->1->6->7 or 0->4->7, depending on the actual costs of the edges, which are not provided here. Assuming uniform edge weights, the shortest path would be 0->4->7.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Determine the shortest path from node 1 to node 5.\\n   - **Solution B**: We would apply a shortest path algorithm starting from node 1. Node 1 has direct edges to nodes 3 and 6. We would follow the path through node 3 to node 0 and then to node 5, since there's a direct edge from node 0 to node 5. The shortest path would be 1->3->0->5.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Find the shortest path from node 2 to node 4.\\n   - **Solution C**: Again, using a shortest path algorithm, we would start from node 2, which has an edge to node 5. From node 5, we could go back to node 0 and then to node 4.

Node 4 has an edge to node 7, but we want to go to node 2. Since there is no direct edge from node 4 to node 2, we have to find an alternative route. Node 4 is connected to node 0, and node 0 is connected to node 5. Node 5 is then connected to node 2.
