Starting from node 0, we would explore the graph, keeping track of the shortest distance to each node until we reach node 5. The shortest path would be from node 0 to node 7 to node 4 and finally to node 5. Therefore, the shortest path is: 0->7->4->5.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 3 to node 14 in the same graph.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nUsing a shortest path algorithm again, we start from node 3 and explore the graph. The shortest path would be from node 3 to node 12, then to node 14. Therefore, the shortest path is: 3->12->14.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 13.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nWe would apply the shortest path algorithm from node 1. We would find the shortest path to be from node 1 to node 9, then to node 10, to node 11, and finally to node 14, but since we need to go to node 13, we would take a step back from node 14 to node 6, and then to node 13.
