Since we are not implementing the algorithm here, we'll just describe the process. Starting from node A, we explore all adjacent nodes until we reach node E.

In this case, the shortest path is J->N->L->M.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nDetermine the shortest path from node C (2) to node I (9) in the given graph.\\n\\n**Solution 3:**\\nAgain, using the shortest path algorithm, we would find that the shortest path from node C to node I is C->J (which doesn't exist, so we move to the next possible node which is K, and so on).
