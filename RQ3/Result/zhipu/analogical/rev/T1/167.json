We will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path because it is well-suited for unweighted graphs or when we do not have information about the weights of the edges. BFS explores the nearest neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\n2. Starting from the source node (5), we will explore all its adjacent nodes (neighbors).\\n\\n3. For each neighbor, we will mark it as visited and add it to a queue to explore its neighbors in the subsequent steps.\\n\\n4. We will keep track of the paths taken to reach each node.\\n\\n5. Once we reach the target node (17), we will backtrack through the paths to determine the shortest path from the source to the target.\\n\\n**Related Problems:**\\n\\n**Problem A:** Given the same graph, find the shortest path from node 0 to node 10.\\n*Solution:* Apply BFS starting from node 0 and stop when node 10 is reached.\\n\\n**Problem B:** Given the same graph, find the shortest path from node 6 to node 16.\\n*Solution:* Apply BFS starting from node 6 and stop when node 16 is reached.\\n\\n**Problem C:** Given the same graph, find the shortest path from node 14 to node 23.\\n*Solution:* Apply BFS starting from node 14 and stop when node 23 is reached.\\n\\n**Answer to the Original Problem:**\\n\\nUsing the BFS algorithm, we would find that the shortest path from node 5 to node 17 is:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->7->10->17\\n\\nThis is the shortest path because BFS guarantees that the first time we visit a node, it is through the shortest path from the starting node.\""}]
