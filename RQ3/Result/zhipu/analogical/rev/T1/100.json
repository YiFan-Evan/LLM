Starting from node 0, we would explore the graph, marking the shortest distance to each node as we go, until we reach node 10. The shortest path would be recorded during this process.\\n   - **Answer A**: The shortest path from node 0 to node 10 is 0->7->8->10.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Find the shortest path from node 5 to node 3.\\n   - **Solution B**: We would apply the same shortest path algorithm from node 5, updating the shortest distances and keeping track of the path taken until we reach node 3.\\n   - **Answer B**: The shortest path from node 5 to node 3 cannot be directly determined from the given edges because there is no direct connection between nodes 5 and 3. However, assuming we can traverse through connected nodes, we would find the shortest path by going through the nodes with the least cumulative distance.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Find the shortest path from node 4 to node 12.\\n   - **Solution C**: Using the shortest path algorithm again, starting from node 4, we would explore the graph, marking distances until we reach node 12.

However, the shortest path would be 11->0->7->8->3->1->2->6->4->6->5->12->5, but since we are looking for the shortest path, we should find the direct connection which is not present in this graph.
