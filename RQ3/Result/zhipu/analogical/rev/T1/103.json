You need to find the shortest path from node A to node G.\\n   - **Solution:** Since all nodes are connected in a linear fashion, the shortest path from A to G would simply be A->B->C->D->E->F->G.\\n\\n2. **Problem B:**\\n   - **Graph Description:** Imagine a grid graph where each node represents a coordinate on a 3x3 grid. Find the shortest path from the top-left corner (node (0,0)) to the bottom-right corner (node (2,2)), assuming you can only move right or down.\\n   - **Solution:** The shortest path in this case would be (0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(1,2)->(2,2) or any other sequence that involves only rightward and downward moves, as these are the only directions allowed.\\n\\n3. **Problem C:**\\n   - **Graph Description:** Given a graph with 5 nodes and 7 edges where node E is a common destination from nodes A, B, and C, and there is also a direct edge from D to E. Find the shortest path from node A to node E.\\n   - **Solution:** The shortest path would depend on the structure of the edges. If the graph is structured such that A->B->E is the shortest route, then the answer would be A->B->E. Otherwise, if there's a direct edge from A to E, then the path would be simply A->E.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem with the provided graph:\\n\\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 4], [1, 4], [1, 11], [2, 10], [3, 7], [3, 12], [5, 7], [6, 8], [6, 11], [7, 11], [10, 12]]}\\n\\nWe need to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 1.\\n\\nTo solve this, we could use Dijkstra's algorithm or a breadth-first search (BFS) since all edges likely have equal weight (the problem does not specify the weights of the edges).
