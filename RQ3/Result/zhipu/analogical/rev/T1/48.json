Starting from node 0, the shortest path to node 4 goes through node 1, and then to node 4. Therefore, the shortest path is 0->1->4.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 7.\\n*Solution:* Using the same algorithms as in Problem 1, we can find that the shortest path from node 2 to node 7 is not directly connected. We must first go to node 4, then to node 1, and finally to node 7. The shortest path is 2->4->1->7.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 3 to node 6.\\n*Solution:* Applying Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS, we find that the shortest path from node 3 to node 6 is direct, as there is an edge between these two nodes.
