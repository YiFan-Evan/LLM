The path must be the shortest in terms of the number of edges traversed.\\n- **Solution:** To solve this, we would use a shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra's or BFS, which are well-suited for unweighted graphs like this one. Starting from node 0, we explore the graph, keeping track of the shortest distance to each node until we reach node 11.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nSuppose we have a graph with nodes labeled 0 to 14, and we need to find the shortest path from node E (node 4) to node M (node 13).\\n\\n- **Description:** Here, the task is to determine the shortest path from node 4 to node 13.
