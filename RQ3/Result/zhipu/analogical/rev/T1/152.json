The shortest path would be determined by traversing through the nodes with the least number of edges.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGraph: Same as provided, but with weighted edges (for example, each edge has a weight of 1, except for the edge from node 1 to node 6 which has a weight of 2).\\nStarting Node: 1\\nDestination Node: 12\\nDescription: In this scenario, the graph has a weighted edge which might affect the shortest path. We need to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 12 considering the weights.\\nSolution: Dijkstra's algorithm would be appropriate here since we have weighted edges. The path from node 1 to node 12 would be calculated based on the total weight of the edges.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGraph: Same as provided, but with a different set of edges (e.g., [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7], [7, 8], [8, 9], [9, 10], [10, 11], [11, 12], [12, 13], [13, 14]]).\\nStarting Node: 0\\nDestination Node: 14\\nDescription: The graph is now a simple path graph, and the task is to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 14.\\nSolution: In this case, the shortest path is trivially the sequence of nodes from the start to the destination since the graph forms a straight line.
