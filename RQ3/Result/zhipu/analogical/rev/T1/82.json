Starting from node 0, we explore its neighbors and keep track of the shortest path to each node. We continue this process until we reach node 11. The shortest path would be 0->1->3->7->9->11.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGraph: The same as the provided graph.\\nStarting node: 2\\nDestination node: 12\\n**Solution 2:** Similarly, we apply Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS from node 2 to find the shortest path to node 12.

From node 7, we can reach node 3, and from node 3, we can reach node 1, and finally, from node 1, we can reach node 4. However, since we are looking for the shortest path from node 6 to node 4, we do not need to go through node 3 and node 1. Instead, we can directly go from node 6 to node 4 through node 7. There is no edge from node 6 to node 4, so we need to go through an intermediate node, which is node 7. The shortest path is therefore 6->7->4.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->7->4\""}]
