Starting at node 0, we would explore the graph until we reach node 5, keeping track of the shortest path at each step.\\n- The shortest path would be: 0->4->7->5\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 2 to node 6.\\n- Solution: We would apply the same shortest path algorithm from node 2 to node 6. We would follow the edges of the graph, recording the shortest distance to each node and updating it if a shorter path is found.\\n- The shortest path would be: 2->3 (since there's no direct edge from 2 to 6) and then from 3 to 6, but there is no direct path from 3 to 6 either. We would need to backtrack to find the shortest path, which is: 2->7->6\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 1 to node 4.\\n- Solution: Again, using the shortest path algorithm, we would start at node 1 and find the shortest route to node 4 by considering all possible paths and choosing the one with the fewest edges.\\n- The shortest path would be: 1->7->4\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 1 to node 3 in the given graph.\\n\\n- Solution: Applying the shortest path algorithm from node 1 to node 3, we find that there is no direct edge between these two nodes. We must traverse through other nodes to find the shortest path.
