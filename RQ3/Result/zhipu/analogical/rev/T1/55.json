Starting at node 0, we explore the graph level by level until we reach node 4. The shortest path from node 0 to node 4 would be 0->6->4, with a distance of 2 edges.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nIn the same graph, determine the shortest path from node 1 to node 7.\\n\\n*Solution 2:*\\nUsing a shortest path algorithm again, we would begin at node 1 and explore the graph to find the shortest path to node 7. The shortest path from node 1 to node 7 is 1->5->4->7, with a distance of 3 edges.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 6 to node 2 in the given graph.\\n\\n*Solution 3:*\\nStarting from node 6 and using a shortest path algorithm, we would find that the shortest path to node 2 is 6->0, then 0 has no direct edge to 2, so we backtrack and find the path 6->4->5->1 and then 1->2, with a total distance of 4 edges.
