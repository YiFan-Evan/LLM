Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity except the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (min-heap) and insert the start node with a distance of 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, extract the node with the smallest distance.\\n4. For each neighbor of the current node, if the path to the neighbor through the current node is shorter than the known distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\\n5. Repeat the process until the target node is reached or the priority queue is empty.\\n\\nFor the given graph and start node 20 to end node 9, the shortest path is found by this algorithm to be: 20->21->12->19->10->9.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 20->21->12->19->10->9\""}]
