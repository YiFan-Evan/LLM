Starting at node 0, we would explore nodes 2 and 3. From node 2, we could go to nodes 4 and 5, and from node 3, there is no path to node 7. By following the path through node 2 to node 4 and then to node 5, we find that node 5 has no direct connection to node 7. However, from node 1, we can reach node 6, and from node 6, we can reach node 7. So, the shortest path is 0->2->4->5->6->7.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 7], [6, 7]]}\\nStarting node: 1\\nDestination node: 4\\n\\n*Solution 2:*\\nWe apply a shortest path algorithm to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4. Since there is a direct connection from node 2 to node 4 and node 2 can be reached from node 1 through node 6, the shortest path is 1->6->2->4.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 7], [6, 7]]}\\nStarting node: 3\\nDestination node: 5\\n\\n*Solution 3:*\\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS, we start at node 3 and find the shortest path to node 5. Since node 3 is connected to node 7, which is not on the path to node 5, we look at the other edges. Node 0 is connected to node 2, and from node 2, we can reach node 5.

Since there is no direct edge from 0 to 1, we look for an indirect path. Node 0 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is not connected to node 1. However, node 1 is connected to node 6. There is no path from node 0 to node 1 without going through other nodes, and the shortest path would be 0->2->5->6->1.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 7], [6, 7]]}\\nStarting node: 2\\nDestination node: 7\\n*Solution 2:*\\nTo find the shortest path from node 2 to node 7, we can see that there is no direct edge between these nodes.
