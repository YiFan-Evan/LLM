Starting from node 0, we would explore the edges to nodes 6 and 10. From node 6, there are no direct edges to node 12, but node 10 has an edge to node 7, which in turn has an edge to node 9, and node 9 has an edge to node 12. Thus, the shortest path would be 0->6->10->7->9->12.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGraph: Same as provided.\\nStart node: 3\\nDestination: 8\\n**Solution 2:**\\nAgain, using a shortest path algorithm, we start from node 3 which has a direct edge to node 12. Node 12 is not our destination, but we continue. Node 12 does not connect directly to node 8, but node 7 does, and node 7 can be reached from node 2 which is connected to node 3. So, we go from node 3 to node 12 and then to node 7, and from node 7 to node 8. The shortest path is 3->12->7->8.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGraph: Same as provided.\\nStart node: 1\\nDestination: 5\\n**Solution 3:**\\nWe would begin at node 1, which has an edge to node 8. Node 8 has edges to nodes 5 and 7, so we can directly reach node 5 from node 8. Thus, the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is 1->8->5.\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 10], [1, 8], [2, 7], [3, 12], [4, 7], [5, 11], [5, 8], [7, 10], [7, 8], [7, 9], [9, 12]]}\\nStart node: 6\\nDestination: 10\\n**Solution to the Original Problem:**\\nApplying a shortest path algorithm, we start from node 6, which has direct edges to nodes 0 and 10. Since node 10 is our destination, the shortest path is simply from node 6 to node 10.

Node 0 is connected to node 6, which is not our destination, but node 6 is connected to node 10, which is not the destination either. However, node 10 is connected to node 7 via another edge.
