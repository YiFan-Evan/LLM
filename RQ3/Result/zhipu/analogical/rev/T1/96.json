The algorithm would involve setting the distance to the starting node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity, then updating the distances based on the edges and finally selecting the unvisited node with the smallest distance.\\n\\n2. **Problem B:**\\n   - **Description:** Determine the shortest path from node 1 to node 9.\\n   - **Solution:** Apply Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS (which is more suitable for unweighted graphs but can be adapted for weighted graphs like this one) to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 9. The process would involve similar steps as in Problem A, with the starting node set as 1 and the target node as 9.\\n\\n3. **Problem C:**\\n   - **Description:** Calculate the shortest path from node 3 to node 6.\\n   - **Solution:** Utilize the same Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS approach to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 6.

Since the graph is not fully specified with edge weights, we'll assume each edge has a weight of 1 for simplicity. Starting from node 5, we update the distances to the neighboring nodes and select the unvisited node with the smallest distance iteratively until we reach node 4.\\n\\nHowever, upon examining the graph, we notice that there is no direct path from node 5 to node 4. Node 5 is connected to node 12, and node 4 is connected to nodes 2, 6, and 7. There is no direct sequence of edges that connects node 5 to node 4.
