Starting from node 0, we visit node 3, then node 4, and finally node 7. The shortest path is 0->3->4->7.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 7], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 2\\nDestination: 7\\n\\n**Solution 2:**\\nUsing a similar approach as above, we find the shortest path from node 2 to node 7. Node 2 has direct edges to nodes 5 and 3. Node 3 is on the path to node 7, so we take that route. The shortest path is 2->3->4->7.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 7], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 1\\nDestination: 6\\n\\n**Solution 3:**\\nWe apply the same strategy to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6. Since there is no direct edge from node 1 to node 6, we must traverse through node 4 to node 7 and then to node 6. However, there is no direct path from node 7 to node 6, so the path is only 1->4->7. This is the shortest path because any other route would involve additional nodes, which would increase the path length.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 7], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 3\\nDestination: 4\\n\\n**Solution:**\\nThe shortest path from node 3 to node 4 is directly through an edge connecting these two nodes.
