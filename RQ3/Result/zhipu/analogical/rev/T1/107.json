Starting from node 1, we explore the neighbors and continue until we reach node 5. The shortest path would be 1->2->3->5.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 3 to node 10 in the given graph.\\n- **Solution 2:** Similarly, using an algorithm like BFS, we start from node 3 and explore the paths until we reach node 10. The shortest path in this case is 3->2->1->9->10.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, determine the shortest path from node 4 to node 12.\\n- **Solution 3:** Using the same approach as above, we begin at node 4 and find our way to node 12. Since node 4 does not directly connect to any node that leads to node 12, we would need to go back to node 0, which connects to node 6, and from there to node 10, which is connected to node 12.

Node 9 is connected to node 10, which is connected to node 6, and node 6 is connected to node 0.
