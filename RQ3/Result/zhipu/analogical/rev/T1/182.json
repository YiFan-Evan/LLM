Below is a step-by-step description of how the BFS algorithm might find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (21) and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (previously visited nodes).\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node and examine its neighbors.\\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record the node that led to it (to reconstruct the path later), and enqueue it.\\n4. Once node 18 is dequeued, backtrack using the recorded nodes to find the shortest path.\\n\\nBy applying this method, we find that the shortest path from node 21 to node 18 is:\\n\\n21 -> 12 -> 7 -> 3 -> 4 -> 18\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 21->12->7->3->4->18\""}]
