Starting from node 0, we would explore the edges [0, 10] and [0, 6]. Then, we'd continue from nodes 10 and 6 to find the shortest path to node 12, which in this case would be 0->10->12.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\n- Graph: Same as given.\\n- Start Node: 2\\n- Destination: 4\\n- Description: Determine the shortest path from node 2 to node 4.\\n- Solution: We would apply the same shortest path strategy. From node 2, we have the edge [2, 8]. From node 8, there are no direct edges to node 4, but we can reach node 4 through node 12 by traversing the edge [8, 12] and then [12, 3], and finally [3, 4].

From node 7, we can go to node 8 via [7, 8]. Since there's no direct edge to node 5, we continue to node 12 through [8, 12]. From node 12, we take the edge [12, 3], and from node 3, we reach node 5 via [3, 4] and [4, 11] and finally [11, 5].

Starting from node 6, we can take the edges [6, 11], [6, 8], or [6, 10].
