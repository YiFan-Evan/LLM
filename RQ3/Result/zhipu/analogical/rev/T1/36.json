Starting from node 0, we explore the graph level by level until we reach node 6.

We explore the nodes in the order of their distance from the start node until we reach node 3.\\n   - **Answer:** The shortest path from node 1 to node 3 is: 1->5 (since there is no direct edge from 1 to 3, and the path through 5 is the shortest)\\n\\n3. **Shortest Path from Node 2 to Node 7:**\\n   - **Problem Description:** Determine the shortest path from node 2 to node 7.\\n   - **Solution:** Using the BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm, we start from node 2 and find the shortest route to node 7.
