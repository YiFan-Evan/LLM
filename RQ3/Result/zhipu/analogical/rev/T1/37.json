Starting from node 0, we explore its neighbors and continue until we reach node 7. The shortest path would be 0->5->6->7.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [1, 2], [2, 4], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 1\\nDestination: 6\\n\\n**Solution 2:**\\nTo find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6, we apply the same method as above. Starting at node 1, we move to node 2, then to node 4, and finally to node 5. From node 5, we go to node 6. The shortest path is 1->2->4->5->6.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [1, 2], [2, 4], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 2\\nDestination: 0\\n\\n**Solution 3:**\\nTo find the shortest path from node 2 to node 0, we start at node 2 and have two choices, nodes 4 and 3. Node 4 does not directly connect to node 0, but node 3 does through node 5. Thus, we go from node 2 to node 3, then to node 5, and finally to node 0.
