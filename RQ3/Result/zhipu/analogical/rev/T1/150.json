Starting from node 0, we explore all the neighbors, keeping track of the shortest path found to each node. The shortest path to node 14 from node 0, based on the provided edges, is 0->8->9->14.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nUsing the same algorithms as above, we would start at node 1 and explore the graph. The shortest path from node 1 to node 5 is not directly provided by the edges, so we need to find an indirect route. The shortest path would be 1->3 (or 1->12, but since 1->3 is shorter, we take that path) -> 4 -> 6 -> 5, which is 1->3->4->6->5.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 7.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nAgain, applying Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS starting from node 2, we find that the shortest path to node 7 is not directly connected. We go from node 2 to node 14, then from node 14 to node 9, and finally from node 9 to node 7, resulting in the path 2->14->9->7.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 13], [0, 8], [1, 3], [1, 12], [1, 9], [2, 14], [4, 6], [5, 11], [7, 11], [7, 12], [8, 9], [9, 14], [10, 13]]}, find the shortest path from node 4 to node 6.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nApplying Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS starting from node 4, we find that node 4 is directly connected to node 6.
