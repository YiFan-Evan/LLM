Starting from node 1, the shortest path to node 3 is simply node 1 to node 3 directly, which is represented as: 1->3.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 4.\\n\\nSolution:\\nAgain, using a shortest path algorithm, we find that there is no direct path from node 2 to node 4.
