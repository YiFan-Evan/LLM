Starting at node 11, we explore the graph, updating the shortest distance to each node until we reach node 13. The given edges suggest that node 11 is directly connected to node 7 and node 9. Node 7 is also connected to node 9, and node 9 is connected to node 14. However, we need to reach node 13, not node 14. Looking at the edges, we see that node 4 is connected to node 13 and also to node 9. This suggests that the shortest path from node 11 to node 13 would be through node 9 to node 4 and then to node 13.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 11->9->4->13\""}]
