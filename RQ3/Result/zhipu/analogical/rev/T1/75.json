Starting from node 2, we explore its neighbors and continue until we reach node 4. The shortest path in this case is 2->4.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 0 to node 5.\\n- **Solution 2:** We would again apply a shortest path algorithm. From node 0, we have a direct edge to node 5. Thus, the shortest path is 0->5.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 6 to node 7.\\n- **Solution 3:** Once more, we would use an algorithm to find the shortest path.

Since node 1 is connected to node 2 and node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 4 is not directly connected to node 3, we need to backtrack. Node 3 is connected to node 5, but node 5 is not on the direct path from node 1 to node 3. We notice that node 2 is connected to node 4, and node 4 is connected to node 6, but node 6 is not connected to node 3 either. However, we missed that node 3 is connected to node 5, and node 5 is connected to node 0, which is connected to the start node. The correct shortest path is 1->2->4->6, but we need to go from node 6 to node 5, and then from node 5 to node 3 to reach the destination.

Node 1 is connected to node 2. From node 2, we can reach node 4, and from node 4, we can reach node 6. However, we need to reach node 3. We notice that node 3 is connected to node 5, which is not directly connected to node 1 or node 2. We must backtrack from node 4 to node 2 and then to node 1, and from node 1, we do not have a direct path to node 3. But since node 3 is connected to node 5 and node 5 is connected to node 0, we can go from node 1 to node 2, then to node 4, then to node 6, then to node 5, and finally to node 3. Therefore, the shortest path is 1->2->4->6->5->3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2->4->6->5->3. However, upon closer inspection, I made an error in my initial assessment. There is no direct path from node 1 to node 3 in the given graph, and the path I provided includes nodes that are not necessary to reach node 3 from node 1. The correct path should be found by looking at the direct connections and the graph structure. Node 1 is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 4, but we need to find a connection to node 3. Since node 3 is connected to node 5 and node 5 is not directly connected to node 1 or node 2, we need to find another route. There is no direct path from node 1 to node 3, and the correct path is not included in the given edges. Therefore, the correct answer should be:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: No path exists from node 1 to node 3 in the given graph.\""}]
