Problem: Find the shortest path from node 0 to node 14.\\n   Solution: Using Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS (Breadth-First Search), we can find the shortest path from node 0 to node 14. Starting from node 0, we explore its neighbors and continue until we reach node 14, keeping track of the shortest distance and the path taken.\\n   Expected shortest path: 0->1->13->14\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the shortest path from node 2 to node 10.\\n   Solution: Similarly, applying Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS starting from node 2, we would explore the graph to find the shortest path to node 10.
