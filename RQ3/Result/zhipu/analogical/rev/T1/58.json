Starting from node 0, we explore the neighbors and keep track of the shortest path to each node. The shortest path from node 0 to node 7 is 0->3->4->7.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 in the provided graph.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nUsing a similar approach as above, we can determine the shortest path from node 1 to node 5. The shortest path would be 1->3->0->5.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the graph, determine the shortest path from node 6 to node 4.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nAgain, applying the BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm, we find the shortest path from node 6 to node 4. Since there is no direct edge from node 6 to node 4, we must go through node 1 to reach node 3 and then node 4.

Since there is no direct edge from 4 to 2, we need to backtrack to a node that can connect us to node 2. Node 4 is connected to node 0, which is not directly connected to node 2. However, node 0 is connected to node 5, and node 5 is connected to node 2.
