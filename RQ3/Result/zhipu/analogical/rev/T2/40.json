Starting from node 0, the shortest path to node 5 would be 0->4->5.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Given the same graph, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 6.\\n   - **Solution B**: Similar to Problem A, using Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS, the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 would be 1->7 (since there's no direct edge from 1 to 6, we go through node 7 which connects to node 6 through node 5). However, since node 5 does not directly connect to node 7, the actual path would be 1->7->5->6.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Given the same graph, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3.\\n   - **Solution C**: Using the shortest path algorithm, the shortest path from node 2 to node 3 would be 2->5->6 (since there's no direct edge from 2 to 3, and the path through node 5 and then node 6 is the shortest available route).
