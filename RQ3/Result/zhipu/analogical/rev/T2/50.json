Problem: Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4.\\n   Solution: To solve this, we would use a shortest path algorithm such as Dijkstra's or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Starting from node 1, we would explore the edges to node 7, then to node 3, and finally to node 4. The shortest path would be 1->7->3->4.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the shortest path from node 0 to node 7.\\n   Solution: We would again use a shortest path algorithm. From node 0, we have two direct connections to nodes 1 and 2. From node 1, we can reach node 7 directly. Therefore, the shortest path would be 0->1->7.\\n\\n3.
