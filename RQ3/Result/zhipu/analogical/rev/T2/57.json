Problem A:\\n   - Description: Given a graph with nodes labeled A through H (translated from the given node numbers for clarity), and edges connecting them as specified, find the shortest path from node A (start node 0) to node B (target node 1).\\n   - Solution: Use Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS to find the shortest path. Starting at node A, the algorithm would first explore nodes 6 and 7, then move to nodes 1, 2, 4, 3, and 5. The shortest path to node B is directly from node A to node B, which is just one edge.\\n   - Shortest Path: A->B\\n\\n2.
