The shortest path from node 3 to node 0 is 3->4->3->0 because node 3 is directly connected to node 4, and node 4 is not on the direct path to node 0, so we backtrack to node 3 and then proceed to node 0.\\n\\nHowever, it seems there might be a mistake in the graph description because node 4 does not have a direct connection to node 0. If we follow the given edges, the shortest path from node 3 to node 0 would be 3->7 (since 3 is connected to 7) and then from 7 to 0 (since there is no direct edge from 3 to 0). But there is no edge from 7 to 0 either.
