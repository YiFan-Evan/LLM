Starting at node 0, we would explore the neighbors and keep track of the shortest path to each node. The path from node 0 to node 7 would be 0->6->7, with a distance of 2 edges.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 4.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nUsing a shortest path algorithm, we would determine the shortest route from node 2 to node 4. The path would be 2->5->4 or 2->6->1->4, both having the same length of 3 edges. However, since we're looking for the shortest path, we would typically return the first path found which would be 2->5->4.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 4 to node 5.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nAgain, applying a shortest path algorithm, we would find that there is no direct edge from node 4 to node 5.

However, this is not correct as per the given edges. There is no direct path from 1 to 3 or 1 to 4 that includes the given edges.
