Starting from node 0, we explore its neighbors, marking the distance to each and updating it if a shorter path is found.

The shortest path from node 10 to node 6 is 10->11->10->8->6 (since there is a direct edge from 10 to 11, and then from 11 to 10, which seems to be a mistake in the graph description as it creates a loop.
