Starting from node 0, we explore its neighbors, which are nodes 2 and 3. Node 3 has a direct edge to node 7, so the shortest path is 0->3->7.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 in the given graph.\\n- Solution: Using the same algorithms as in Problem 1, we start from node 1 and explore its neighbor, which is node 6. Then, we look for paths from node 6 to node 5. Node 6 is connected to node 7, and node 7 is not directly connected to node 5, but node 2 is connected to both nodes 4 and 5. We have to go back to node 0 from node 6, then to node 2, and finally to node 5. The shortest path is 1->6->7->0->2->5.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 6.\\n- Solution: Starting from node 2, we have two direct neighbors, nodes 4 and 5. Neither of these nodes is directly connected to node 6. We must go back to node 0 (which is connected to node 2), then to node 3 (which is connected to node 0), and finally to node 6 (which is connected to node 3).
