Starting from node 0, we explore the neighbors and find that the shortest path to node 3 is 0->2->3. Therefore, the shortest path from node 0 to node 3 is 0->2->3.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Determine the shortest path from node 1 to node 6.\\n   - **Solution B**: Using a similar approach as above, we can find that the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is 1->5 (since there is a direct edge between these nodes), and then from node 5 to node 6, there are no direct edges, so we go back to node 1 and take the edge to node 6. This gives us the path 1->5->1->6. However, this is not the shortest path. The correct shortest path is actually 1->4->7->6. Therefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 6 is 1->4->7->6.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Discover the shortest path from node 2 to node 4.\\n   - **Solution C**: By applying the shortest path algorithm, we find that the shortest path from node 2 to node 4 does not exist directly. However, we can reach node 4 from node 2 by going to node 0 first and then to node 4, which gives us the path 2->0->4. Therefore, the shortest path from node 2 to node 4 is 2->0->4.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Find the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 in the given graph.\\n\\n- **Solution**: Using a shortest path algorithm, we find that the shortest path from node 0 to node 5 is 0->6->1->5.

Starting from node 5, we have a direct edge to node 1, but there's no direct edge to node 3. We would then go from node 1 to node 4, and from node 4 to node 7, and finally from node 7 to node 3. This gives us the path 5->1->4->7->3. Therefore, the shortest path from node 5 to node 3 is 5->1->4->7->3.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Find the shortest path from node 6 to node 4.\\n   - **Solution B**: Since there's no direct edge from node 6 to node 4, we would need to find an alternate route. Node 6 is connected to node 0, and from node 0, we can reach node 2, and from node 2, we can reach node 4. This gives us the path 6->0->2->4. Therefore, the shortest path from node 6 to node 4 is 6->0->2->4.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Identify the shortest path from node 7 to node 1.\\n   - **Solution C**: There is a direct edge from node 7 to node 1, so the shortest path is simply 7->1.
