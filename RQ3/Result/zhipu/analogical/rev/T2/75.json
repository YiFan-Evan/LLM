Starting at node 0, the shortest path to node 4 is 0->2->4. Therefore, the final answer is: 0->2->4.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Given the same graph, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 7.\\n   - **Solution B**: Similarly, using a shortest path algorithm, we would find that the shortest path from node 2 to node 7 is 2->4->6->7. Therefore, the final answer is: 2->4->6->7.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Given the same graph, find the shortest path from node 6 to node 1.\\n   - **Solution C**: Using the shortest path algorithm, we find that there is no direct path from node 6 to node 1. We would have to go back to node 0 and then to node 1, which would be 6->0->1. However, this is not the shortest path since node 6 is already connected to node 1 through node 4.
