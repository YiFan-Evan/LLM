Starting from node 0, we explore its neighbors until we reach node 11, keeping track of the shortest path.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 13.\\n*Solution:* Similarly, using Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS, we would start at node 1 and explore paths until we reach node 13, recording the shortest path as we go.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 5 to node 9.\\n*Solution:* Again, by applying Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS starting from node 5, we would track the shortest path until we reach node 9.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 6], [2, 14], [3, 14], [4, 14], [5, 11], [5, 7], [6, 10], [6, 9], [7, 12], [7, 14], [8, 13], [8, 9], [9, 11]]}, find the shortest path from the start node 8 to the destination node 4.\\n\\n*Solution:* Since node 4 is not directly connected to any other nodes in the provided edge list, and there is no direct path from node 8 to node 4, there is no path between these two nodes in the graph.

However, there seems to be a mistake in the provided graph data. If we assume that node 4 is directly connected to node 14 (as per the edge [4, 14]), we can find a path from node 4 to node 8 by going from node 4 to node 14 and then to node 13, which is connected to node 9, and node 9 is connected to node 8.\\n\\nThe shortest path would be: 4->14->13->9->8.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->14->13->9->8. \\n\\nNote: If the edge [4, 14] was a mistake and node 4 is not connected to node 14, then there would be no path from node 4 to node 8, and the task would be impossible with the given graph structure.\""}]
