Starting from node 1, we would traverse the graph, marking nodes as visited and keeping track of the shortest path to each node. The shortest path from node 1 to node 6 would be 1->6.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 3 to node 7.\\n- **Solution:** Using the same algorithm as above, we start from node 3 and look for the shortest path to node 7.
