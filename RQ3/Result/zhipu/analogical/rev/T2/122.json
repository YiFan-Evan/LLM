Problem A:\\n   - Description: Given a graph with nodes labeled from 0 to 14 and edges connecting them, find the shortest path from node 0 to node 5.\\n   - Solution: Use Dijkstra's algorithm or a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path. Starting from node 0, explore the graph, and keep track of the shortest distance to each node. The shortest path from node 0 to node 5 would be determined by following the path with the least cumulative edge weight or the fewest edges.\\n   - Result: Assuming uniform edge weights, the shortest path might be 0->11->9->4->5.\\n\\n2.
