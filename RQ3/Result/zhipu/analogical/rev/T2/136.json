The graph is represented by an adjacency list, and the nodes and edges are as follows: A -> B, A -> C, B -> D, C -> D, D -> E, E -> F, F -> G, G -> N, and B -> N. The solution to this problem would be to use a shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra's or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from A to N, which in this case might be A -> B -> D -> E -> F -> G -> N.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: In a weighted directed graph with nodes 0 to 15 and edges with weights provided, determine the shortest path from node 0 to node 15.

Given this graph, find the shortest path between two individuals, person X and person Y, who want to know how closely connected they are. If the graph is represented as an adjacency matrix and includes nodes 1 to 10 with various friendships, the shortest path could be determined using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm or BFS.
