Starting from node 3, we explore its neighbors, which are nodes 7 and 12. From node 7, we can reach node 1, and from node 12, there is no direct path to node 10. Continuing the search, we find that the shortest path from node 3 to node 10 is 3->7->1->2->10.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 4 to node 6 in the given graph.\\n\\n*Solution 2:*\\nAgain, using a shortest path algorithm, we start from node 4. Since node 4 is not directly connected to any other nodes in the provided edges, we cannot find a path from node 4 to node 6. This means there is no path, and thus no shortest path, between these two nodes.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, determine the shortest path from node 0 to node 12.\\n\\n*Solution 3:*\\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS, we start at node 0. From node 0, we can reach node 4 and node 11. From node 4, there are no further connections that lead directly to node 12. From node 11, we can reach node 5, and from node 5, we can reach node 8, which is connected to node 12. Therefore, the shortest path from node 0 to node 12 is 0->11->5->8->12.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 11], [1, 7], [2, 9], [2, 10], [2, 5], [3, 7], [3, 12], [5, 6], [5, 11], [5, 8], [8, 12]]}, find the shortest path from node 7 to node 1.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nApplying a shortest path algorithm, we start from node 7.

We explore the neighbors of node 3, which are nodes 7 and 12. Since node 5 is not a direct neighbor of node 3, we continue by exploring node 7's neighbors. Node 7 is connected to node 1, which is not on the path to node 5. However, we notice that node 5 is a neighbor of node 2, and node 2 is a neighbor of node 3. The shortest path from node 3 to node 5 is 3->2->5.\\n\\n**Problem 2:** \\nFind the shortest path from node 6 to node 10 in the given graph.\\n\\n*Solution 2:*\\nUsing a shortest path algorithm, we start from node 6. Node 6 is directly connected to node 5, which in turn is connected to node 2. Node 2 is connected to node 10, thus forming a path from node 6 to node 10. The shortest path from node 6 to node 10 is 6->5->2->10.\\n\\n**Problem 3:** \\nGiven the same graph, determine the shortest path from node 0 to node 9.\\n\\n*Solution 3:*\\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS, we start at node 0. From node 0, we can reach node 4 and node 11. Neither of these nodes provides a direct path to node 9. However, node 2, which is connected to node 9, can be reached from node 5, which in turn is connected to node 0 via node 5's connection to node 11 and then to node 2. The shortest path from node 0 to node 9 is 0->11->5->2->9.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:** \\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 11], [1, 7], [2, 9], [2, 10], [2, 5], [3, 7], [3, 12], [5, 6], [5, 11], [5, 8], [8, 12]]}, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 7.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nApplying a shortest path algorithm, we start from node 1.
