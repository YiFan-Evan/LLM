Starting from node 0, we explore the neighbors, marking the shortest distance to each node, and continue until we reach node 10. The shortest path would be 0->6->9->10.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nIn the same graph, determine the shortest path from node 2 to node 12.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nAgain, using a shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra's or BFS, we start from node 2 and explore the graph. The shortest path from node 2 to node 12 is 2->5, as there is no direct edge from 2 to 12 and going through node 5 is the shortest way to reach node 12.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 4 to node 7 in the given graph.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nWith the same graph, we apply the shortest path algorithm starting at node 4. The shortest path from node 4 to node 7 is 4->2->3->7, as this is the only path that connects node 4 to node 7 through the available edges.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nFind the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 in the given graph.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nUsing the shortest path algorithm, we start at node 1 and look for the shortest path to node 5.
