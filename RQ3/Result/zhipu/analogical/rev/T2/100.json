Since node 4 is not directly connected to node 3 or any of its neighbors, there is no direct path. The path would be the shortest one that includes nodes connected to 3 and leads to 4, which might be 3->8->10->6->4, assuming uniform edge weights.\\n\\n3. **Problem C:**\\n   - **Graph Description:** The same graph with an extra edge added between two nodes that is not in the original edge list.\\n   - **Start Node:** 1\\n   - **Destination Node:** 12\\n   - **Solution:** We would find the shortest path from node 1 to node 12.
