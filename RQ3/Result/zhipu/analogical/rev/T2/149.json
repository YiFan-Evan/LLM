Starting from node 3, we explore its neighbors, which are nodes 4 and 10. Node 4 is connected to node 9, which is not on the path to node 8, but node 10 is not directly connected to node 8 either. We would continue exploring until we find node 8 or the shortest path to it. In this case, we would find that node 3 -> node 10 -> node 13 -> node 8 is the shortest path.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 14.\\n\\n*Solution 2:*\\nUsing a shortest path algorithm, we start from node 1 and explore its neighbors, which is node 7. From node 7, we have two paths to consider: node 7 -> node 12 and node 7 -> node 13. The path through node 13 is shorter to node 14. Following node 13, we see that node 13 is connected to node 0, which is connected to node 10, and node 10 is connected to node 13 (which we've already visited), creating a cycle that doesn't lead to node 14. However, node 13 is also connected to nodes 5 and 6, and node 6 is not on the path to node 14, but node 5 is not directly connected to node 14 either. We continue until we reach node 14. The shortest path from node 1 to node 14 would be node 1 -> node 7 -> node 13 -> node 14.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 0 to node 12.\\n\\n*Solution 3:*\\nWe can apply a shortest path algorithm starting from node 0. Node 0 is connected to nodes 10 and 13. Node 10 is not on the path to node 12, but node 13 is connected to node 5, which is not on the path to node 12 either. However, node 13 is also connected to nodes 6 and 7. Node 6 is not on the path to node 12, but node 7 is connected to node 12. Thus, the shortest path from node 0 to node 12 is node 0 -> node 13 -> node 7 -> node 12.\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 13], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 10], [4, 9], [5, 13], [6, 13], [7, 12], [7, 13], [8, 11], [8, 13], [8, 14]]}, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 5.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nUsing Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS, we start from node 2 and look at its neighbors, which is node 6.

Starting from node 0, we explore its neighbors, which are nodes 10 and 13. Neither of these nodes is directly connected to node 4, but node 13 is connected to node 5, which is not on the direct path to node 4 either. By exploring further, we find that node 10 is connected to node 3, which is directly connected to node 4. Thus, the shortest path from node 0 to node 4 is node 0 -> node 10 -> node 3 -> node 4.\\n\\n**Problem 2:** Given the same graph, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 9.\\n\\n*Solution 2:* Using a shortest path algorithm, we start from node 1 and explore its neighbor, which is node 7. From node 7, we have two paths to consider: node 7 -> node 12 and node 7 -> node 13. Neither of these paths leads directly to node 9, but node 7 -> node 13 -> node 3 -> node 4 -> node 9 is a path that reaches node 9. However, we must check if there's a shorter path. In this case, node 7 is directly connected to node 12, and node 12 is not on the path to node 9. Therefore, the shortest path from node 1 to node 9 is node 1 -> node 7 -> node 3 -> node 4 -> node 9.\\n\\n**Problem 3:** Given the same graph, find the shortest path from node 3 to node 11.\\n\\n*Solution 3:* Applying a shortest path algorithm from node 3, we first explore node 4, which is not connected to node 11. Then we explore node 10, which is also not directly connected to node 11. However, node 3 is connected to node 10, which is connected to node 13, and node 13 is not on the direct path to node 11. We continue and find that node 10 is also connected to node 8, which is connected to node 11. Therefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 11 is node 3 -> node 10 -> node 8 -> node 11.\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:** Given the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 13], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 10], [4, 9], [5, 13], [6, 13], [7, 12], [7, 13], [8, 11], [8, 13], [8, 14]]}, find the shortest path from node 5 to node 2.\\n\\n*Solution:* Using Dijkstra's algorithm or BFS, we start from node 5 and look at its neighbors, which include node 13. Node 13 is connected to node 6, which is not our destination, but node 13 is also connected to node 0, which is not on the direct path to node 2. However, node 13 is also connected to node 7, and node 7 is not on the direct path to node 2 either. We continue exploring and find that node 13 is connected to node 6, and node 6 is connected to node 2. Thus, the shortest path from node 5 to node 2 is node 5 -> node 13 -> node 6 -> node 2.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->13->6->2\\\"\""}]
