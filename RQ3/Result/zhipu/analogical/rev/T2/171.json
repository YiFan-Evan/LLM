Starting from node 0, we would explore all reachable nodes until we reach node 20, keeping track of the shortest path to each node visited. The path would be 0->3->8->23->9->10 (assuming the shortest path; this is a hypothetical example, and the actual shortest path may vary).\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 5 to node 12.\\n\\n*Solution 2:*\\nAgain, using a shortest path algorithm, we would begin at node 5 and explore the graph until we reach node 12. The shortest path might be 5->12 (direct edge) or another path if a shorter one exists. For instance, it could be 5->24->... (if that path turns out to be shorter).\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 15 to node 21.\\n\\n*Solution 3:*\\nWe would apply the same approach to find the shortest path from node 15 to node 21.

Since the graph is not weighted, BFS would be appropriate. Starting from node 10, we explore all nodes until we reach node 9, keeping track of the shortest path to each node.
