However, there seems to be an error in the graph description as provided because node 10 is listed twice in the edges, which is unusual, and it's not clear how node 3 is connected to node 10 or node 4. Assuming the graph description is correct and there is a direct connection from node 3 to node 4, the path would be as stated. If node 10 is a typo and there's a direct edge from node 2 to node 4, then the path would be 7->2->4.\\n\\nAssuming the former case and the graph is correct as given, the shortest path would be:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->2->10->3->10->4\\n\\nIf there's an error in the graph description and we assume a direct connection from node 2 to node 4, the shortest path would be:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->2->4\""}]
