Starting from node 5, we explore all its neighbors, and then continue with the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, until we reach node 1. \\n\\nThe shortest path would be: 5->6->0->1\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 3], [4, 6], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 2\\nDestination: 7\\n\\n**Solution 2:**\\nUsing BFS or Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the shortest path from node 2 to node 7. Node 2 is connected to node 3, which is not on the path to node 7. However, node 2 is not directly connected to node 7, so we must go through other nodes. \\n\\nThe shortest path would be: 2->3\\n\\nBut this is a dead-end since 3 does not connect directly to 7. We must backtrack and try another path.\\n\\nThe correct shortest path would be: 2->1->5->6->7\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 3], [4, 6], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 4\\nDestination: 3\\n\\n**Solution 3:**\\nHere we look for the shortest path from node 4 to node 3. Since node 4 is not directly connected to node 3, we must look for an indirect path. Node 4 is connected to node 6, which is not on the direct path to node 3, so we must explore other connections.\\n\\nThe shortest path would be: 4->6->0->1->2->3\\n\\nNow, for the original problem you presented:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [1, 2], [1, 5], [2, 3], [4, 6], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 5\\nDestination: 0\\n\\n**Solution:**\\nTo find the shortest path from node 5 to node 0, we can use the BFS algorithm. Starting from node 5, we have two options: node 6 and node 0.
