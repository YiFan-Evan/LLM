Starting from node 3, we would explore its neighbors (nodes 9 and 12) and continue until we reach node 7. The path would be 3->9->7.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 10.\\n\\n*Solution 2:*\\nUsing a similar approach, we would start at node 1 and explore its neighbors. Node 1 has direct edges to nodes 4 and 10. Since node 10 is a direct neighbor of node 1, the shortest path is simply 1->10.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 5.\\n\\n*Solution 3:*\\nAgain, using a shortest path algorithm, we would start at node 2 and look for the shortest path to node 5. Node 2 does not have a direct path to node 5, but it is connected to node 10, which is connected to node 5. The shortest path would be 2->10->5.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 10], [2, 10], [2, 12], [3, 9], [3, 12], [5, 7], [6, 7], [11, 12]]}, find the shortest path from the start node 3 to the destination node 9.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nStarting at node 3, the neighbors are nodes 9 and 12.

Node 10 is connected to node 2, which is not on the direct path to node 1. However, node 10 is also connected to node 1 directly. Therefore, the shortest path is 10->1.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nGiven the same graph, find the shortest path from node 12 to node 5.\\n\\n*Solution 3:*\\nFor this problem, we start at node 12 and seek the shortest path to node 5. Node 12 is connected to node 3, and node 3 is not directly connected to node 5. However, node 3 is connected to node 9, which is not on the direct path to node 5 either. Since there is no direct or one-step connection from node 12 to node 5, and the graph does not provide a clear path to node 5 from node 12, there is no path from node 12 to node 5 in this graph.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 10], [2, 10], [2, 12], [3, 9], [3, 12], [5, 7], [6, 7], [11, 12]]}, find the shortest path from the start node 9 to the destination node 3.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nStarting at node 9, we can see that node 9 has a direct edge to node 3.
