Initialize a queue and start by enqueueing the starting node (2).\\n2. Keep track of the paths taken to reach each node using a dictionary.\\n3. Dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\\n4.

From node 2, we can also go to node 12, and from node 12, we can go to node 14, but that doesn't lead to node 5 either.\\n- We missed considering node 9 as a neighbor of node 5. Let's backtrack and consider going from node 2 to node 12, then to node 14, and check if there's a path from node 14 to node 5. There isn't.\\n- We should consider the path from node 2 to node 3, then to node 10, and check for paths from node 10. There's no direct path to node 5 from node 10, but we haven't considered node 9 as a connection to node 5.\\n- We need to go back to node 5 and consider its neighbors: node 9 is a neighbor of node 5, and node 6 is also a neighbor of node 9.\\n- Therefore, we should take the path from node 2 to node 12, then to node 9, and from node 9 to node 6, and finally from node 6 to node 5.\\n\\nSo the shortest path from node 2 to node 5 is: 2->12->9->6->5\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->12->9->6->5\""}]
