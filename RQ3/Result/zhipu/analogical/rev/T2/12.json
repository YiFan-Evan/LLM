The shortest path from node 0 to node 6 is 0->7->3->7->2->4->1->6 (since 0 is connected to 7, 7 is connected to 3, 3 is connected to 7 again, 7 is connected to 2, 2 is connected to 4, 4 is connected to 1, and 1 is connected to 6).\\n\\nHowever, this path includes a redundant step going from 3 to 7 and then back to 7.
