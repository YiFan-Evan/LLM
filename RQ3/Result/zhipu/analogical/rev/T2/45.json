Starting at node 4, we look for the shortest route to node 5. Since there is no direct edge between 4 and 5, we need to traverse through other nodes. The shortest path is: 4->3 (this edge does not exist in the graph, so we must correct this and say that there's no direct path from 4 to 3) -> 0->7->6->5.\\n\\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the provided graph description or in the assumption that there is a path from 4 to 3, which is not listed as an edge. Given the edges in the graph, there is no direct path from node 4 to node 5. We would have to go from 4 to 0, then to 7, and finally to 5, but this is not the shortest path. The correct shortest path, based on the provided edges, is:\\n\\n4->0->7->5.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->0->7->5.\\\"\""}]
