However, we don't have information that Max is a numpus. But since we are only proving Max is a tumpus, and we have no contradiction stating Max cannot be a tumpus, we can use (1) and (4) to derive (17).

Since we have no information that Max cannot be a tumpus or a gorpus, we can derive that Max is a yumpus.

We don't have information about Max being an impus or a wumpus, but we don't need it to conclude that Max is a rompus based on the given premises. Therefore, the final answer is: (16),(9)->(17)\\n\\n**Original Problem Solution:**\\nTo prove that Max is a tumpus and a shumpus and a rompus (17), we need to find a minimal set of premises that allows us to derive this conclusion.
