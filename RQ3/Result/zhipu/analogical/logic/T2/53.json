The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

(2) Max is a grimpus.]\\nProof: From (1) and (2), we cannot directly conclude that Max is a wumpus because the premise does not state that all grimpuses are wumpuses. However, if we had additional premises stating that Max is not a non-wumpus, we could then conclude that Max is a wumpus.\\nSolution: No direct derivation is possible without additional premises.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nDescription: Prove that if everything that is not a numpus is a vumpus, and Max is not a vumpus, then Max is a numpus.\\nPremises: [(1) All non-numpuses are vumpuses.
