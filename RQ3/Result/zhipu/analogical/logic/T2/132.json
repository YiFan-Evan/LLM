From (6), (7), (8), and (9) we know that Alex possesses all these characteristics. Therefore, Alex is a sterpus.\\nSolution: (1),(6),(7),(8),(9)->(21) Alex is a sterpus.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nDescription: Prove that Alex is a vumpus based on the given premises.\\nPremises: (2), (10), (11), (13), (16), (17), (18)\\nProof: From (2) we know that an object with the characteristics of being kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus is a vumpus. From (10), (11), (13), (16), (17), and (18) we know that Alex possesses the characteristics of being bitter, angry, spicy, aggressive, amenable, and kind.

From (12) we know that Alex is an impus. The emotional characteristics listed in (5) do not directly match those of Alex as given in the premises. However, if we consider that Alex's emotional state could be interpreted under the broader terms of 'happy' and 'feisty' (since he is not explicitly described as shy, nervous, or both), then Alex could be considered a yumpus based on the premise that he is an impus.\\nSolution: (5),(12)->(23) Alex is a yumpus. (Note: This is a more interpretive solution as the emotional characteristics are not directly provided for Alex.)\\n\\n**Final Problem Solution:**\\nTo prove that Alex is kind, angry, aggressive, amenable, and a lempus, we need to combine the premises that show Alex has the necessary characteristics with those that define what a lempus is.\\n\\nFrom (3) we know that a gorpus with the taste characteristics of being bitter, sweet, spicy, and sour is a lempus.
