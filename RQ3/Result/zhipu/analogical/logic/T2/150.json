Since Stella is a brumpus (9), and brumpuses can be loruses or wumpuses (7), but we know from (8) that romuses, which are a type of sterpus, are not vampus, and since Stella is not mentioned to be a rompus, we cannot conclude that Stella is a vampus.

Since Stella is a brimpus and brimpuses can be lorpus or wumpus (7), and since Stella is not a dumpus (9), we cannot use (2) to infer anything about Stella. However, since Stella is a grimpus and all numpuses are grimpuses (6), Stella must be a grimpus, which is not a rompus (5). Since rompuses include vumpuses (8) and Stella is not a rompus, Stella cannot be a vampus. Since all vumpuses are zumpuses (4), and Stella is not a vampus, she must be a zumpus.

Since Stella is also a brimpus (9), we do not need to consider her as a rompus. From (7), since Stella is a brimpus, she must be either a lorpus or a wumpus.
