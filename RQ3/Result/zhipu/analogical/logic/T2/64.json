Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

From premise (4), we can deduce that Rex is either spicy or a jompus. Since premise (11) tells us that Rex is also a rompus, and from premise (2), we can deduce that Rex is either small or a jompus. The disjunctions (spicy or jompus) and (small or jompus) can combine to imply Rex is a jompus. However, to get to the proof obligation that Rex is transparent or a jompus, we need to use premise (3) that everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus, but this does not directly help us with transparency. The connection between numpus and transparency is not established in the premises, so we cannot derive the proof obligation directly.
