From (10), (11), and (18), we can derive that Sally is happy, feisty, and shy. We need a premise that connects these properties with being a yumpus. However, no single premise directly connects these three properties with being a yumpus. We need to use (4) to show that if Sally is happy, feisty, shy, and a yumpus, she is a zumpus. But we don't need to prove she's a zumpus; we need to prove she's a yumpus.\\n\\nWe can see from (6) that if Sally is slow and a dumpus, she is a yumpus. From (12) and (17), we know Sally is slow and a dumpus. Therefore, we can conclude that Sally is a yumpus.\\n\\nNow we need to combine this with her being happy, feisty, and shy. Since we don't have a premise that combines all four properties (happy, feisty, shy, and yumpus), we need to find an indirect way to show this. We can use (4) to show that if Sally is a yumpus (which we've just proven) and has the other properties, she must be a zumpus. But again, we don't need to prove she's a zumpus.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to prove (21) is (10), (11), (18), and (6), (12), (17) because they are sufficient to prove that Sally is happy, feisty, shy, and a yumpus.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (10),(11),(18),(6),(12),(17)->(21)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sally is fast.
