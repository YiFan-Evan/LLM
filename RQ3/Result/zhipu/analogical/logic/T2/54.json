Since Max is a brimpus (12) and everything that is a brimpus is also a zumpus (2), and since Max is also a yumpus (13), we need to find a connection between brimpus/yumpus and being earthy, fruity, or a vumpus. We can derive that everything that is a numpus is a tumpus (1), and everything that is a numpus is also earthy or fruity or a vumpus (6). Since Max is a yumpus, we need to connect yumpus to numpus. Unfortunately, there is no direct connection between yumpus and numpus in the given premises. However, since we have no direct connection between yumpus and numpus, and we are looking for a minimal set of premises, we have to rely on the premise that connects directly to the conclusion.Premise (6) connects directly to the conclusion as it includes 'a vumpus' which is part of the disjunction we need to prove.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6)->(14)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a yumpus.
