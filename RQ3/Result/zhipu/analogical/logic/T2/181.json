However, premise (13) tells us that Rex is not a gorpus, and since (4) states that each zumpus is a gorpus, Rex cannot be a zumpus, which is a contradiction. But we don't need to resolve this contradiction directly to prove that Rex is not a jompus. We need to show that Rex cannot be a dumpus or a wumpus because (6) states that every jompus is a dumpus and a wumpus. Since Rex is not a gorpus (13) and (4) states that each zumpus is a gorpus, Rex cannot be a zumpus, and therefore cannot be a jompus either.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(6),(13)->(14)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a vumpus and Rex is not a gorpus and Rex is a rompus.
