Then, if we are given that Rex is a vumpus, we can conclude that (2) Rex is a lorpus.\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1,2)->(3)\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nDescription: If all lempuses are wumpuses, and all wumpuses are tumpuses, prove that no lempus is a brimpus given that all brimpuses are impuses and no tumpus is an impus.\\nSolution: From the premises, we can derive that (1) All lempuses are tumpuses and (2) No tumpus is an impus. Since all brimpuses are impuses, it follows that (3) No tumpus is a brimpus.
