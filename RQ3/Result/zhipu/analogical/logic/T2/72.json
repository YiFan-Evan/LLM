(16) Sally is red.]\\nProof: Sally has the attributes of being orange, red, and brown (9, 14, 16). We need to show that Sally is also a rompus to apply premise (1). Sally is a brimpus (11), and from premise (4), we know that all brimpuses are rompuses. Therefore, Sally is a rompus.

Sally is also a yumpus (12), which, according to premise (3), makes her a jompus because she must have the attributes of being fast, slow, or moderate.\\nSolution: (3),(4),(11),(12)->(19), where (19) Sally is a rompus and a jompus.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nTo prove that Sally is orange, red, brown, and a rompus, we need to show that she has all the attributes listed in premise (1) other than being a rompus, and then we can use that premise to conclude she is a rompus.
