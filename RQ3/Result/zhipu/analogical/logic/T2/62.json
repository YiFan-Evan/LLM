(2) All short and blue creatures are sellions. (3) Blob is short. (4) Blob is tall.\\nSolution: Blob cannot be both a dellion and a sellion because the premises do not allow for a creature to be both tall and short.

If Person X is both wise and foolish, what can we conclude about Person X's nature?\\nPremises: (1) All wise and just beings are philosophers. (2) All foolish and unjust beings are fools. (3) Person X is wise. (4) Person X is foolish.\\nSolution: The premises do not provide a direct rule for beings that are both wise and foolish.
