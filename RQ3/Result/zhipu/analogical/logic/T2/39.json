From (11), Max is either a jompus or a tumpus. If Max is a jompus, then by (4) Max is a yumpus. If Max is a tumpus, we cannot directly conclude Max is a yumpus from the given premises.

Problem: Given premises (3), (6), and (11), prove that Max is a yumpus.\\n   Solution: From (3) and (6), we know that all shumpuses are yumpuses and all shumpuses are numpuses. However, this does not help us with Max being a yumpus since we do not know if Max is a shumpus. From (11), Max could be a jompus or a tumpus, but without connecting this to yumpuses, we cannot prove Max is a yumpus.

From (12), Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus. Since we know that all tumpuses are yumpuses, if Max is a tumpus, then Max is a yumpus.

Given that Max is a lorpus, a jompus, or a tumpus (12), and considering that all jompuses are yumpuses (4), we can conclude that Max is a yumpus if Max is a jompus. However, we also need to account for the possibility that Max is a tumpus, which we can do with premise (7) stating that each tumpus is a yumpus. We do not need to consider Max being a lorpus because premise (9) states that lorpuses are numpuses, but we need a connection to yumpuses, which is provided by (4) and (7).
