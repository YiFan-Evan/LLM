From premise (10), we know Polly is a vumpus and a gorpus. From premise (1), we know every gorpus is a vumpus, which Polly already is, so this doesn't help us further. However, from premise (5), we know that every rompus is a sterpus and a lorpus.

If we had a premise stating that every gorpus is a rompus, we could connect Polly to a rompus through her being a gorpus. However, there is no such direct premise. Instead, we look for another connection.\\n\\nPremise (2) tells us that dumpuses are rompuses and yumpuses. Since we don't have direct information that Polly is a dumpus, we can't use this premise directly. But we do have information that Polly is a vumpus (from premise 10) and from premise (6) that each vumpus is an impus and a numpus. We still lack the connection between vumpuses or impuses and rompuses.\\n\\nUnfortunately, with the given premises, there is no direct or indirect way to conclude that Polly is a rompus.
