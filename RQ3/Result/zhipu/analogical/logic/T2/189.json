(16) Tumpuses are happy. (20) Lorpuses are not dull.\\nProof: Since Alex is a vumpus (by assumption), and all vumpuses are opaque, Alex is opaque. However, the proof obligation is about dullness, not opacity or happiness, so none of these premises help directly to prove that Alex is not dull. This problem does not have enough information to derive the conclusion from the given premises.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nDescription: Given that every impus is not snowy and Alex is an impus, prove that Alex is not snowy.\\nPremises: (7) Each impus is not snowy. (18) Each sterpus is an impus.\\nProof: (7),(18) -> (n) Alex is not snowy. Since Alex is an impus and all impuses are not snowy, it follows that Alex is not snowy.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nDescription: Given that all yumpuses are small and Alex is a numpus, prove that if all numpuses are cold, then Alex is cold.\\nPremises: (10) Every yumpus is small.

From the premises, we know that Alex is a numpus (23) and a yumpus (24). We also know that impuses are not snowy (7) and that Alex is an impus (18). However, to link Alex's numpus or yumpus identity to not being snowy, we need to establish a connection between numpuses or yumpuses and impuses, or find a direct statement that numpuses or yumpuses are not snowy.\\n\\nWe can see that there is no direct premise that says numpuses or yumpuses are not snowy. However, since Alex is a numpus (23) and all numpuses are tumpuses (12), and all tumpuses are happy (16), we still need a connection to 'not snowy'. The premise that connects this chain to 'not snowy' is that impuses are not snowy (7) and Alex is an impus (18).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (7),(18),(23),(24) -> (25) Alex is not snowy.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is a yumpus.

However, we do not need to use the fact that Alex is a tumpus to prove that Alex is not snowy. Instead, we can directly use the fact that Alex is a numpus and that all impuses are not snowy. Since we don't have a direct link from numpuses to not snowy, we can't use (13) directly. However, we don't actually need to establish that Alex is a tumpus because we have (2) and (18) which allow us to infer that as Alex is a numpus, and we have no information that numpuses are snowy, but we know impuses are not snowy, and we don't have any information that separates numpuses from impuses in terms of snowiness.
