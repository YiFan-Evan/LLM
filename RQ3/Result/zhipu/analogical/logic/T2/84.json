From premise 5, we know that everything that is hot or cold or a yumpus is a rompus. Therefore, since Alex is a yumpus, it follows that Alex is also a rompus. However, the proof obligation asks us to show that Alex is large, small, or a rompus. Since we have no direct information about Alex being large or small, we cannot use premises 1, 2, or 3 for that part of the proof. The premise that connects 'yumpus' to 'rompus' is premise 5, and premise 7 states that Alex is a yumpus.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n(5),(7)->(8)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Alex is a yumpus.
