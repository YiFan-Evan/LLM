(2) Sam is a lumus.\\nProof: From premise (1), we know the characteristic of lumuses. Using premise (2), we can directly conclude that Sam is sparkly because Sam is a lumus.

(2) All jimpuses are happy.\\nProof: The proof obligation is to show that jimpuses are happy, which is already given in the second premise. Therefore, only premise (2) is needed. Thus, (2)->(3) where (3) is \\\"Jimpuses are happy.\\\"\\n\\nProblem 3:\\nDescription: Assuming that all glimpuses are dim and every glimpus is a blimpus, prove that blimpuses are dim.\\nPremises: (1) All glimpuses are dim. (2) Every glimpus is a blimpus.\\nProof: The proof obligation can be derived by first deducing from premise (1) that if something is a glimpus, it must be dim. Then, using premise (2), if it is a glimpus, it is also a blimpus, which means it is dim. Therefore, (1,2)->(3) where (3) is \\\"Blimpus are dim.\\\"\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nTo prove that Sam is overcast, we need to use the premises that relate Sam to zumpuses and zumpuses to being overcast.
