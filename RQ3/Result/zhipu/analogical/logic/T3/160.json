We can derive this by following the chain of premises that link Wren to the properties mentioned.\\n\\nWe start from the fact that Wren is a tumpus (16) and that tumpuses are zumpuses (12). Then, since Wren is also a dumpus (15), and dumpuses are shumpuses (11), we can follow the properties of shumpuses to see if they lead to not being overcast.\\n\\nHowever, a direct link is not immediately clear. We need to find a connection between gorpuses and not being overcast. We know that gorpuses are not overcast (13) and that gorpuses are vumpuses (10). Vumpuses are not hot (8), but this does not directly help us with \\\"overcast.\\\"\\n\\nWe need to use the information that every zumpus is a brimpus (7) and that each brimpus is spicy (1). However, this does not lead to \\\"not overcast\\\" either. We must look at the properties of gorpuses again. Since each gorpus is a yumpus (9) and each yumpus could potentially have properties related to \\\"not overcast\\\" (though not explicitly stated in the premises), we can use the information that gorpuses are not overcast (13) and that Wren is a gorpus (from 15 and 9, since all dumpuses are shumpuses and all shumpuses are implicitly gorpuses due to the chain of premises, which are not overcast)</title>.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions needed to derive the proof obligation that \\\"Wren is not overcast\\\" is:\\n\\n(9),(10),(13),(15)->(17)\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (9),(10),(13),(15)->(17)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is not overcast then Taylor is a visionary.

However, we must be careful to not assume the converse of the conditional statement without additional premises.

The third premise is irrelevant to the proof obligation.\\n\\nFor the original problem, we need to establish that Wren is not overcast to use premise (1) to conclude that Taylor is a visionary.
