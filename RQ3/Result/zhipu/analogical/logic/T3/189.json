From (2), we know some gadgets are not toys. Combining these, we can infer that some widgets are not toys, but the premise set does not allow us to say that all widgets are not toys, as we don't have information about all gadgets.

From (2), oranges are fruits, so they must also be either red or green (Premise 3). Since oranges are not red (Premise 4), they must be green. The correct set of premises is: (1),(3),(4)->(5)\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nTo prove that Alex is not snowy, we need to find a path from Alex being a numpus and a yumpus to the conclusion that Alex is not snowy.

However, we do know that impuses are not snowy, and if we can link Alex to impuses, we could prove that Alex is not snowy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there is no direct connection between being a numpus or yumpus and not being snowy. We need to look for an indirect connection. The only connection we have to 'not snowy' is through impuses, but we don't have a premise that directly relates Alex to impuses or provides a rule that would allow us to infer that numpuses or yumpuses are not snowy.\\n\\nTherefore, given the premises provided, it is not possible to prove that Alex is not snowy.
