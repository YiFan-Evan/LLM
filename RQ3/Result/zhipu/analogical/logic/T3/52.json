From the premises, we can see that:\\n- Stella is angry (8)\\n- Stella is amenable (14)\\n\\nHowever, there is no direct premise stating that Stella is a brimpus. We need to deduce this from other premises. Since Stella is a rompus (9) and is both hot (11) and cold (10), according to premise (6), Stella must be a brimpus.\\n\\nTherefore, the premises that lead to the conclusion that Taylor is a visionary are:\\n(8) Stella is angry, (14) Stella is amenable, and the deduction from (6), (9), (10), and (11) that Stella is a brimpus.\\n\\nSolution: (6),(8),(9),(10),(11),(14)->(15)\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(8),(9),(10),(11),(14)->(15)\""}]
