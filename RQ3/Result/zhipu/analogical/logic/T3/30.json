From the premises, we can see that Max is a brimpus (23) and a jompus (24). Since every brimpus is a tumpus (15) and every tumpus is a lorpus (1), and if we assume that lorpuses are not cold (22), we can derive that Max is not cold. However, we need to establish the link between lorpuses and not being cold, which is not directly provided in the premises. Assuming that the property of not being cold can be derived from being a lorpus (which is a stretch without additional information), the minimal set of premises would be:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(22),(23)->(25) \\n\\nBut this assumes that 'lorpus' entails 'not cold', which is not explicitly stated.
