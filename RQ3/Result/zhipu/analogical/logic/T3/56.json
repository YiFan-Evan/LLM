[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Given that Sam is a tumpus (6) and everything that is red or a tumpus is a lempus (3), we can infer that Sam is a lempus. However, this does not directly help us with the proof obligation. Instead, we look at premise (7) which tells us that Sam is a jompus. Using premise (2), which states that everything that is bright or a jompus is a numpus, we can infer that since Sam is a jompus, Sam must be a numpus.
