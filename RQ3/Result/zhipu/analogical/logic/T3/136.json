(2) Flowers require water to grow. (3) Thorns are found on roses.] Prove: (4) Thorns require water to grow.\\n\\n**Solution 2:**\\nThe proof obligation that thorns require water to grow cannot be directly derived from the premises. While roses, which are flowers, require water to grow, this does not imply that the thorns themselves require water. Thus, (1), (2) -> (4) is not a valid derivation.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nPremises: [(1) All apples are fruits. (2) Fruits are a source of vitamins. (3) Apples grow on trees.] Prove: (4) Trees are a source of vitamins.\\n\\n**Solution 3:**\\nThe proof obligation that trees are a source of vitamins can be derived from premises (1) and (2). Since all apples are fruits and fruits are a source of vitamins, apples are a source of vitamins. However, the proof obligation refers to trees, not apples. Therefore, while there is a connection, (1), (2) -> (4) is not a direct and valid derivation because the premises do not explicitly state that trees are a source of vitamins.\\n\\n**Original Problem Solution:**\\nTo derive that Fae is a sterpus, we need to find a chain of logical implications that connect Fae to being a sterpus. From the premises, we can see that (9) directly connects Fae to being a zumpus, and (5) connects zumpus to sterpus.
