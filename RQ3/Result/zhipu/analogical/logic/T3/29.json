If we can show that whatever Wren is, it leads to being an impus through a series of 'is an' relationships, we can prove the statement. From premises (14) and (15), we can deduce that Wren is either a yumpus, dumpus, tumpus, or numpus. Then, using the premises that all these types are impuses, we can conclude that Wren is an impus. However, since we need to provide the minimal set, we only need to show that one of these types (yumpus, dumpus, tumpus, or numpus) is an impus, and then we can connect it to Wren through premises (14) or (15). Hence, the minimal set of premises would include (1) as the base that all impuses are impuses, one of (6), (8), (11), or (13) to show that the type Wren belongs to is an impus, and (14) or (15) to connect Wren to that type.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Wren is an impus then Taylor is a visionary.
