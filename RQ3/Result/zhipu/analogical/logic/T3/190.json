(2) Every brimpus is a vumpus. (14) Every vumpus is wooden.\\nProof: Since (2) states that every brimpus is a vumpus, and (14) states that every vumpus is wooden, it follows that every brimpus is wooden.\\nSolution: (2),(14)->(new proposition: Every brimpus is wooden)\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nDescription: Using the information provided, prove that if every dumpus is a gorpus and every dumpus is nervous, then nervous creatures are not necessarily gorpus.\\nPremises: (4) Each dumpus is a zumpus. (5) Every dumpus is a gorpus.

Stella is identified as a brimpus in premise (24), and brimpuses are snowy (3), but this does not directly lead to the conclusion that she is transparent. However, we can use the following premises to derive that Stella is transparent:\\n\\nPremises: (23) Stella is a jompus. (10) Rompuses are transparent. (15) Every rompus is a dumpus. (20) Each grimpus is a rompus. (21) Vumpuses are grimpuses. (19) Vumpuses are tumpuses. (24) Stella is a brimpus.\\n\\nFrom (21) and (19), we know that vumpuses are grimpuses, and from (20), we know that grimpuses are rompuses. Therefore, vumpuses are also rompuses. From (15), we know that every rompus is a dumpus, and from (10), we know that rompuses are transparent. Since Stella is a brimpus (24), and if we follow the chain from brimpus to vumpus to grimpus to rompus to dumpus, we can deduce that Stella, as a brimpus, is also a rompus by transitive property.
