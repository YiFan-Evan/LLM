The contradiction arises from the premises themselves.

Now, we need to find a premise that contradicts Max being an impus. There is no direct premise stating Max is an impus, but if we consider (8) and (12), both state conditions that lead to being a grimpus or a yumpus, respectively, and Max does not meet these conditions (he is not mentioned as being a tumpus or an impus). However, these premises are not enough to conclude Max is not an impus directly.\\n\\nTo conclude that Max is not an impus, we need to use premises that define Max's attributes and exclude the possibility of being an impus. Premises (2), (4), (6), (7), (11), (14), and (16) describe Max's attributes, and none of them mention impus. However, we need to ensure that we don't miss any premise that could imply Max is an impus indirectly. After careful consideration, it seems that (2), (4), (6), (7), (11), and (14) are sufficient to deduce that Max is not an impus because they define Max's properties comprehensively, and being an impus is not one of them.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(4),(6),(7),(11),(14)->(17)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is not an impus then Taylor is a visionary.
