From (5), we know dumpuses are vumpuses. Therefore, dumpuses must also be kind or mean, but the proof obligation only asks for kindness, which is included in (1).\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nDescription: If all jompuses are shy and happy, and every brimpus is a jompus, prove that all brimpuses are happy.\\nSolution: (4) -> (11)\\nExplanation: From (4), we know that all jompuses are happy. Since every brimpus is a jompus, it follows that all brimpuses are also happy.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nDescription: Provided that all lorpus are either fast or moderate and all gorpus are sterpus, prove that if something is both a lorpus and a gorpus, it is fast.\\nSolution: (8) -> (11)\\nExplanation: From (8), we know that all lorpus are either fast or moderate and all gorpus are sterpus.
