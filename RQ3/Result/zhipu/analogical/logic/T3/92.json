From the premises, we need to find a chain of reasoning that leads to this conclusion. Premise (17) states Max is discordant, and premise (12) states Max is loud. We need a premise that connects being loud, discordant, and a grimpus. Premise (2) states that everything that is loud, discordant, and a grimpus is a numpus. However, we don't need to introduce the numpus classification to prove that Max is a grimpus; we just need to establish that he is loud, discordant, and a grimpus.\\n\\nPremise (3) states that everything that is bright and dull and an impus is a grimpus. Since Max is dull (premise 13) and an impus (premise 15), and we can infer from premise (3) that Max is a grimpus.
