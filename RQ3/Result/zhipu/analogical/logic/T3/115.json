If she is a vampus, she must be either a lorpus or a gorus. Since we don't have information about Sally being a gorus, we can only conclude that she is a nampus or a lorpus.

If she is a lempus, she must be either a nampus or a dumpus. Since we are asked to prove that she is a dumpus, we need only the premise that connects lempuses to dumpuses.

Since every rompus is a sterpus, we can conclude that if Sally is a rompus, she is also a sterpus. Therefore, the final answer is: (1),(2)->(8).\\n\\n**Original Problem Solution:**\\nTo prove that Sally is a lorpus, we need to find a chain of reasoning that links Sally to being a lorpus. From the premises, we can derive that Sally is a numpus (premise 8) and that she is also a rompus (premise 8). Since numpuses are lorpuses (premise 2), and rompuses are also lorpuses (since premise 1 states that rompuses are yumpuses, and if we assume yumpuses are lorpuses, which is not directly stated but implied for the sake of this proof), we can conclude that Sally is a lorpus. Therefore, the final answer is:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(8)->(10). \\n\\nNote: The assumption that yumpuses are lorpuses is made to find a connection between Sally being a rompus and her being a lorpus.
