[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem A:\\nPremises: [(1) All flarbuses are glarbuses. (2) Glarbuses are never quiet. (3) Some zimbuses are flarbuses. (4) Bimbles are always zimbuses. (5) Each zimbuse is a flarbus.]\\nProve: (6) Some bimbles are not quiet.\\nSolution: The proof obligation (6) can be derived from premises (1), (3), and (5), as the transitive property allows us to infer that some zimbuses are glarbuses, and since glarbuses are never quiet, some zimbuses are not quiet. Since bimbles are zimbuses, some bimbles are not quiet.\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(5)->(6)\\n\\n2. Problem B:\\nPremises: [(1) All cats are mammals. (2) Some mammals are pets. (3) No pets are wild animals. (4) Tigers are not pets. (5) Lions are cats.]\\nProve: (6) Lions are not wild animals.\\nSolution: The proof obligation (6) cannot be derived from the given premises. The fact that lions are cats (and thus mammals) and that pets are not wild animals does not allow us to conclude that lions are not wild animals because there is no information linking cats or lions specifically to pets or non-wild animals.\\nTherefore, there is no valid derivation.\\n\\n3.

(5) Some fruits are sweet.]\\nProve: (6) Some fruits are red or green and sweet.\\nSolution: The proof obligation (6) can be derived from premises (1), (2), and (5). Since every apple is a fruit and fruits are either red or green, apples must be red or green. If some fruits are sweet, then it follows that some red or green fruits (which could include apples) are sweet.\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(5)->(6)\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nTo prove that Max is not melodic (13), we need to establish a connection between Max and the fact that shumpuses are not melodic (7). Since Max is an impus (12) and each impus is a shumpus (8), it follows that Max is a shumpus.
