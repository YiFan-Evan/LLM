From the premises, we know that Rex is a numpus (10) and a rompus (11). Since we are interested in the proposition about transparency, we look for propositions that involve tumpus or jompus. We find that everything that is transparent or a jompus is a tumpus (3), and everything that is discordant or a tumpus is a zumpus (5). However, there's no direct connection between numpus or rompus and transparency or jompus in the premises. The only way to connect them is through the properties of tumpus and zumpus, but there's no premise that allows us to derive that Rex is a tumpus or a jompus directly from being a numpus or a rompus. Therefore, based on the given premises, it is not possible to prove that Rex is transparent or a jompus.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: There is no minimal set of premises that leads to the proof obligation (12) Rex is transparent or a jompus.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Rex is transparent or a jompus then Taylor is a visionary.
