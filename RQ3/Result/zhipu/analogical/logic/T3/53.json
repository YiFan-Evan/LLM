However, we don't have information about Max being any of those, so this premise isn't directly useful for the derivation.\\n- Premise (11) tells us that something cannot be both a yumpus, a tumpus, a lorpus, and not a grimpus, which is irrelevant to the proof since we know Max is a brimpus.\\n- We don't have any direct premise stating that Max is a numpus, and since we need to prove that Max is not a numpus, we need to show that the assumption of Max being a numpus would contradict the established facts.\\n\\nThe minimal set of premises that leads to the proof obligation is:\\n\\n- (1) Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus is a brimpus.\\n- (12) Max is a yumpus.\\n- (13) Max is a brimpus.\\n- (14) Max is a tumpus.\\n- (15) Max is a lorpus.\\n\\nUsing these premises, we can deduce that Max is a brimpus and does not need to be a numpus to be a brimpus.
