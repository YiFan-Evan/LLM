From the premises, we know that Fae is a gorpus (8) and a shumpus (9). Since Fae is a gorpus, and everything that is a gorpus or a jompus is a wumpus (2 adjusted for Fae), we can infer that if Fae is a gorpus, then Fae is also a wumpus. However, we need to prove Fae is blue or a jompus, not a wumpus.\\n\\nTo derive the proof obligation, we can use the following premises:\\n- (1) Everything that is earthy or a gorpus is a jompus.\\n- (7) Everything that is opaque or a jompus is a rompus.\\n- (8) Fae is a gorpus.\\n- (9) Fae is a shumpus.\\n\\nFrom (8) and (1), we can infer that Fae is a jompus because Fae is a gorpus. Since the proof obligation is to show that Fae is blue or a jompus, we have already satisfied the proof obligation by showing that Fae is a jompus. We do not need to use (7), (8), or (9) to prove that Fae is blue, as the proof obligation is satisfied by the fact that Fae is a jompus.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1)->(10)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Fae is blue or a jompus then Taylor is a visionary.
