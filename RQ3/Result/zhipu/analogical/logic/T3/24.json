From the premises, we can derive that every rompus is a sterpus (5, 9), and every sterpus is not large (19). Since Max is a yumpus (23) and every yumpus is a jompus (21), and if we assume every jompus is a rompus (an intermediate conclusion not directly given but necessary for the proof), then Max is a rompus.
