The first premise (1) directly states a condition under which Taylor is a visionary. We need to find a way to satisfy the 'if' part of this premise, which is that Alex is luminous or a numpus.\\n\\nPremise (11) tells us that Alex is a jompus, and premise (3) tells us that everything that is bright or a jompus is a sterpus. However, this does not help us with the proof obligation because we need Alex to be luminous or a numpus, not a sterpus.\\n\\nPremise (12) tells us that Alex is a zumpus. We can use this information along with premise (10), which states that everything that is cold or a tumpus is a zumpus. Since we know Alex is a zumpus, we can work backward to see if we can find a connection to Alex being luminous or a numpus.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there is no direct connection from Alex being a zumpus to Alex being luminous or a numpus. However, premise (9) states that everything that is large or a zumpus is a numpus, and if we assume Alex is large (which is not given but necessary for this derivation), then Alex could be a numpus. This would satisfy the 'if' part of premise (1), and thus, we could conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\\n\\nSince we do not have information about Alex's size, we cannot use this approach. Therefore, we cannot derive (13) Taylor is a visionary from the given premises without additional information.\\n\\nHowever, if we assume that we can infer additional information (which is not ideal), we might say:\\n\\n(11), (10), (9) -> (13)\\n\\nThis would mean that Alex being a zumpus implies being a numpus (which it does not, according to the premises), and then we could use premise (1) to conclude that Taylor is a visionary. But this is an invalid derivation because we are adding information that is not present in the premises.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer, based on the given premises alone, is that the proof obligation (13) cannot be derived from the premises provided. There is no valid set of premises that leads to the conclusion that Taylor is a visionary.\""}]
