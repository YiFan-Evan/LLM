Since a tumpus is defined by being fruity, floral, and a brimpus (Premise 4), and Stella has all these qualities (Premises 8, 10, and 9), we can deduce that Stella is a tumpus. Additionally, we need the premises that define the properties of a gorpus (Premise 3) to show that Stella, being dull and bright (Premises 13 and 14), is also a gorpus. However, since we only need to prove that Stella is a tumpus and not specifically that she is a gorpus, we do not need to include Premise 3 in our minimal set.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(9),(10),(11),(12),(14)->(16)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
