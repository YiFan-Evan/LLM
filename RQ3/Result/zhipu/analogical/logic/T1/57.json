Problem Description: Given the premises that all creatures with fur and fins are called 'mumpus', all creatures that are loud and quiet are 'gumpus', and all creatures that are both red and blue are 'humpus'. If Bob is loud, quiet, red, and blue, prove that Bob is a mumpus.\\n\\n   Solution: The premises relevant to the proof obligation are that all creatures that are loud and quiet are 'gumpus' (premise for loud and quiet creatures), and Bob is loud and quiet (characteristics of Bob). However, there is no direct connection between being loud and quiet and being a mumpus, so we cannot derive the proof obligation from the given premises. Therefore, the solution would be that the proof obligation cannot be derived.\\n\\n   Therefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3)->(n) cannot be proven.\\n\\n2. Problem Description: If all things that are sweet and sour are 'swoos', all things that are soft and hard are 'hoos', and all things that are cold and hot are 'toos'. If a fruit is sweet, sour, soft, and hard, prove that the fruit is a swoos and a hoo.\\n\\n   Solution: The relevant premises are that all things that are sweet and sour are 'swoos' (premise for sweet and sour things) and all things that are soft and hard are 'hoos' (premise for soft and hard things). The fruit being sweet, sour, soft, and hard connects directly to these premises.\\n\\n   Therefore, the final answer is: (1),(2)->(n).\\n\\n3. Problem Description: It is stated that all objects that are shiny and dull are 'bumpus', all objects that are light and heavy are 'dumpus', and all objects that are square and round are 'rumpus'. If an object is both shiny and heavy, prove that the object is a dumpus.\\n\\n   Solution: The relevant premises are that all objects that are light and heavy are 'dumpus' (premise for light and heavy objects) and the object being shiny and heavy. While the object's being shiny does not directly relate to the proof obligation, its being heavy does, and thus it connects to the premise for 'dumpus'.\\n\\n   Therefore, the final answer is: (2)->(n).\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nTo prove that Wren is slow, fast, and an impus, we need premises that relate Wren's slowness, fastness, and impus status. The relevant premises are:\\n\\n- Wren is slow (8).\\n- Wren is fast (10).\\n- Everything that is slow and fast and an impus is a lempus (4), but we don't need this to prove Wren is an impus; we only need to establish Wren's slowness and fastness.\\n- Wren is an impus, which can be derived from the premises that Wren is a grimpus (12) and everything that is nervous, shy, and a grimpus is an impus (2).\\n\\nSo, we need (8), (10), and (2) to establish that Wren is slow, fast, and an impus, with (12) connecting Wren's grimpus status to impus status.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(8),(10),(12)->(14).\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
