Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

Problem A:\\n   - Premises: [(1) All birds have wings. (2) Penguins are birds. (3) Penguins cannot fly.]\\n   - Prove: (4) Penguins do not have wings.\\n   - Solution: This is a contradiction problem. From (1) and (2), we can infer that penguins have wings (3,4->2). However, premise (3) states that they cannot fly, which implies that they don't have wings as expected from a bird, creating a contradiction. Therefore, the premises provided are insufficient to prove (4). No valid derivation exists.\\n\\n2. Problem B:\\n   - Premises: [(1) Anything that is both a mammal and a bird is an animal. (2) Humans are mammals. (3) Humans are not birds.]\\n   - Prove: (4 interactive conversation.\\n   - Solution: From (2) and (3), we can conclude that humans are not both mammals and birds (2,3->5). However, the proof obligation (4) does not logically follow from the premises provided because it is not related to the information given. Therefore, the premises do not lead to the proof obligation.\\n\\n3. Problem C:\\n   - Premises: [(1) All triangles have three sides. (2) A square has four sides. (3) A square is not a triangle.]\\n   - Prove: (4) A triangle is not a square.\\n   - Solution: This is a simple logical derivation. From (1) and (2), we know that triangles and squares have different numbers of sides.Premise (3) directly supports the proof obligation (4), stating that a square cannot be a triangle. Therefore, the derivation is (1,2,3->4).\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nTo prove that 'Max is not a numpus' (16), we need to use the premises that establish what Max is and what Max is not. From the premises, we know that Max is a yumpus (2), a wumpus (3), an impus (6), a lempus (9), a brimpus (13), a tumpus (14), and a lorpus (15). We also know that Max cannot be a grimpus (11) because he is a brimpus, and everything that is a yumpus, an impus, and a lempus is a vumpus (10), but Max is not mentioned to be a vumpus, so this doesn't help us directly with the proof obligation.\\n\\nThe premises also tell us that everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, and a lorpus is a brimpus (1), and Max is all three of those (2, 14, 15). Furthermore, everything that is a sterpus, a numpus, or a shumpus is a brimpus (5), but Max is not a sterpus, a numpus, or a shumpus as there are no premises stating that he is any of those. Therefore, we can conclude that Max cannot be a numpus because he is already proven to be a brimpus, and the set of characteristics that make something a brimpus does not include being a numpus.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises necessary to derive the proof obligation (16) is:\\n\\n(1),(2),(3),(5),(6),(9),(13),(14),(15)->(16)\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(3),(5),(6),(9),(13),(14),(15)->(16)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
