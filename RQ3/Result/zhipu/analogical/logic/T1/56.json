Therefore, the final answer is: (1),(2)->(3)\\n\\n**Original Problem Solution:**\\nTo prove that Sam is rainy or a numpus, we need to use the information that Sam is a jompus (premise 7) and the premise that everything that is bright or a jompus is a numpus (premise 2). Since Sam is a jompus, we can infer that Sam is a numpus. However, we need to prove that Sam is rainy or a numpus, not just that Sam is a numpus. To get to the \\\"rainy or\\\" part, we need to consider the premise that everything that is rainy or a numpus is a grimpus (premise 1), but this doesn't help us with the \\\"or rainy\\\" part directly. We need to find a way to connect Sam being a jompus to Sam being rainy.\\n\\nSince premise 2 tells us that if Sam is a jompus, then Sam is a numpus, and we have premise 7 that Sam is indeed a jompus, we can infer that Sam is a numpus. However, this does not allow us to conclude that Sam is rainy, as we have no direct premise connecting jompus to rainy.\\n\\nUnfortunately, with the given premises, we cannot derive that Sam is rainy or a numpus. The premises do not provide a way to connect being a jompus to being rainy. Therefore, we cannot complete the proof obligation as stated.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: The proof obligation (8) cannot be derived from the given premises.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
