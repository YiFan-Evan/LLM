Since lorpuses are yumpuses (18) and yumpuses are not small (13), we can deduce that lorpuses are also not small. However, none of these premises directly link Rex's sweetness.\\n\\nThe direct path to prove that Rex is sweet is to use premises (23) and (11) because if Rex is a jompus and all impuses are sweet, and given that we have a chain that connects jompuses to impuses (through lorpus and gorpus, although we don't need to use those connections here), then Rex must be sweet.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (11),(23)->(25)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
