(2) All quibbuses are snubbuses. (3) Zog is a zebbus.\\nProof: From (1) and (3), we can infer that Zog is a quibbus.

It is also known that Grog is a flibus and not a glibus. Prove that Grog is not a blibus.\\nPremises: (1) If something is a flibus and a glibus, then it is a blibus. (2) Grog is a flibus. (3) Grog is not a glibus.\\nProof: From (1), (2), and (3), we can deduce that Grog cannot be a blibus, as it does not fulfill the condition of being both a flibus and a glibus.\\nSolution: (1),(2),(3)->(4) where (4) is \\\"Grog is not a blibus\\\".\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nDescription: We are given that anything that is both soft and hard at the same time is a wribus, and that Nog is soft.

(3) Nog is not a wribus.\\nProof: From (1) and (2), if Nog were also hard, it would be a wribus. Since (3) states that Nog is not a wribus, it follows that Nog cannot be hard.\\nSolution: (1),(2),(3)->(4) where (4) is \\\"Nog is not hard\\\".\\n\\n**Original Problem Solution:**\\n\\nTo prove that Wren is muffled and loud and discordant and melodic and a dumpus, we need to link the properties of Wren that are given in the premises to the conclusion. We can see that the properties \\\"muffled,\\\" \\\"loud,\\\" \\\"discordant,\\\" and \\\"melodic\\\" are individually mentioned in premises (7), (11), (10), and (17), respectively. However, to reach the conclusion that Wren is a dumpus, we need to establish that Wren has a combination of properties that are associated with being a dumpus.\\n\\nPremise (5) tells us that everything that is both opaque and transparent and a dumpus is a yumpus. This premise does not help directly with proving Wren is a dumpus but does show a relationship between dumpus and other properties. The properties that define a dumpus are given in premise (2), and Wren has several of the properties mentioned there (angry, mean, aggressive, and an impus). However, to be a dumpus, Wren must also be amenable, which is given in premise (12).\\n\\nTherefore, we need premises that establish Wren as being an impus (16) and amenable (12), as these are necessary conditions to be a dumpus according to premise (2). The properties muffled, loud, discordant, and melodic are not directly connected to Wren being a dumpus, but they are part of the proof obligation and are given in premises (11), (17), (10), and (7), respectively.\\n\\nSo, the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Wren is muffled and loud and discordant and melodic and a dumpus is:\\n\\n(2),(7),(10),(11),(12),(16),(17)->(18)\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(7),(10),(11),(12),(16),(17)->(18)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
