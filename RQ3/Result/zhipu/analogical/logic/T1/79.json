Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Then, from (1) and (2), we can deduce that if a glimze is a tinze, it must be a fimze and therefore a kimze.

But from (3), we know that no gnarg is a wnarg. By contrapositive, no wnarg can be a gnarg. Since snargs are either fnargs or gnargs, and we have a contradiction with gnargs and wnargs, it follows that no snarg can be a wnarg.

Since no drup is a grup and plips are either crups or drups, it follows that all plips must be crups, and therefore all plips are grups.

From (3), since Fae is a grimpus, Fae must also be a shumpus.
