Alex is a numpus (23) and a yumpus (24). Since numpuses are vumpuses (13) and vumpuses are not mentioned as being snowy, we need another path. Since Alex is a yumpus, we can use the fact that impuses are not snowy (7) and Alex is connected to impuses through the chain: Alex is a sterpus (24), sterpuses are impuses (18), and impuses are not snowy (7).
