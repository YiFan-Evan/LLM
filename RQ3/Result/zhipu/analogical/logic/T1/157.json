From (5) and (8), we can deduce that since every shumpus is a gorpus, and every gorpus is a vumpus, then every shumpus is also a vumpus. However, we don't need to introduce shumpus into our proof since Polly is already established as a vumpus and a gorpus.\\n\\nFrom (5), we know that every rompus is a sterpus and a lorpus. Since we have established that Polly is a gorpus (and thus a vumpus from premise (1)), and since (5) does not specify that lorpus and vumpus are mutually exclusive, we can deduce that Polly could also be a rompus if she is a lorpus. But to be more precise in our derivation, we need to establish a direct link between vumpus and rompus.\\n\\nUnfortunately, with the given premises, there is no direct statement that connects vumpus to rompus. Therefore, we cannot derive the proof obligation (11) Polly is a rompus solely from the given premises.
