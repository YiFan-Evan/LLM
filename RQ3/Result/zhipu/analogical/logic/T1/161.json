Since Polly is also a wumpus (from 9), and every wumpus is a tumpus (from 4), Polly is a tumpus. Since each tumpus is a lorpus (from 6), and given that Polly is a lorpus (from 10), we can deduce that Polly is a tumpus. Then, from (7), we know jompuses are grimpuses, and from (8), sterpuses are gorpuses. However, we don't have a direct connection between Polly and gorpuses through these premises.
