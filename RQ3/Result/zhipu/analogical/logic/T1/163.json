[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Since all widgets are gadgets and every widget is a tingbat, we can infer that tingbats include widgets. However, we cannot directly conclude that tingbats are not toys based on the given premises. Therefore, this proof obligation cannot be satisfied with the given premises.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nPremises:\\n(1) All cats are mammals.\\n(2) Some mammals are pets.\\n(3) No pets are wild animals.\\nProve: (4) Some cats are not wild animals.\\nSolution: The relevant premises are (1) and (2). Since all cats are mammals and some mammals are pets, it follows that some cats (which are mammals) are pets. Given that no pets are wild animals, it can be concluded that some cats are not wild animals.

Since penguins are birds and some birds cannot fly, it is possible that penguins are among those birds that cannot fly. However, we cannot make a definitive conclusion without additional information.
