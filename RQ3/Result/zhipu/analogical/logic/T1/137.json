From (1) and (3), we know that if Max is a tumpus, he is also a lorpus. Similarly, from (5) and (7), we know that if Max is a sterpus, he is also a jompus, but this doesn't help us directly with the proof obligation. However, from (2), we know that if Max is a lorpus, then he is either luminous or wooden or both. Therefore, the minimal set of premises that leads to the proof obligation is (1), (2), and (3) for the connection between tumpus and lorpus, and (6) and (7) to establish that Max is indeed a tumpus and a sterpus.
