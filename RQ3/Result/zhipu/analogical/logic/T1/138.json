[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

From premise 2, we know that pigeons are birds, and from premise 3, we know that birds that migrate can fly long distances. Since pigeons are birds and some birds can fly long distances, it follows that pigeons can fly long distances.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nPremises: \\n(1) All apples are fruits. \\n(2) Some fruits are red. \\n(3) Anything that is red and an apple is sweet.\\n\\nProve: \\n(4) Some fruits are sweet.\\n\\n**Solution:**\\n(2),(3)->(4)\\nThe proof obligation can be derived using premises 2 and 3. From premise 2, we know that some fruits are red, and from premise 3, we know that red apples are sweet. However, this does not directly prove that some fruits are sweet because not all fruits are apples.

Since Sam is a lempus (premise 6), it follows that Sam is a brimpus.
