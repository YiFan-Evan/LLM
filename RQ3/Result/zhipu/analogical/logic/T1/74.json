From the given premises, we can see that Alex is related to rompuses and numpuses, and rompuses are related to sterpus and numpuses, which are in turn related to brimpuses. Since brimpuses are related to yumpuses and grimpuses, and we need to reach tumpuses, we look for a chain of relations that can lead us from Alex to tumpuses.\\n\\nFrom premises (10) and (7), we know Alex is a rompus, and each rompus is a sterpus and a numpus. From premise (2), each sterpus is a brimpus. Since the first premise states that brimpuses are yumpuses and grimpuses, we do not need these details to prove Alex is a tumpus. However, we need to connect brimpuses to tumpuses. Unfortunately, the premises do not directly relate brimpuses to tumpuses, but premise (8) states that each tumpus is a shumpus and a vumpus. We need to find a connection between numpuses and vumpuses to use this premise.\\n\\nPremise (3) states that every numpus is a jompus and a lorpus. We do not have a direct connection between numpuses and tumpuses, but premise (8) gives us the information that each tumpus is a shumpus and a vumpus. If we can show that Alex is a vumpus, we can conclude that Alex is a tumpus. However, premises do not provide a direct link from Alex to vumpuses.\\n\\nSince we cannot derive that Alex is a tumpus using the given premises, there is no valid derivation from the provided statements to the proof obligation. Therefore, the final answer is:\\n\\nNo valid derivation is possible from the given premises to prove (11) Alex is a tumpus.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
