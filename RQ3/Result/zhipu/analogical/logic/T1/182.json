You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

(2) All mammals are animals. (3) Dogs are not birds. (4) Some birds are pets. (5) Whiskers is a cat.]\\nProve: (6) Whiskers is an animal.\\nSolution: The proof obligation can be derived from premises (1) and (2) because we can deduce that since Whiskers is a cat (premise 5), and cats are mammals (premise 1), and mammals are animals (premise 2), Whiskers must be an animal.\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(5)->(6)\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nPremises: [(1) All roses are flowers. (2) Some flowers fade quickly. (3) No sunflowers are roses. (4) Daisies are not roses. (5) Lily is a sunflower.]\\nProve: (6) Lily does not fade quickly.\\nSolution: The proof obligation can be derived from premises (1), (3), and (5). Since Lily is a sunflower (premise 5), and no sunflowers are roses (premise 3), Lily cannot be a rose. Since all roses are flowers (premise 1), and we have established that Lily is not a rose, it follows that Lily is not one of the flowers that fades quickly (premise 2).\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(5)->(6)\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nPremises: [(1) All apples are fruits.

Since the apple on the table is red (premise 5), and some fruits are red (premise 2), it follows that the apple is a fruit. Since all apples are fruits (premise 1), the apple on the table is indeed a fruit. Since bananas are yellow (premise 3), and the apple on the table is red, it cannot be a banana.\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(5)->(6)\\n\\n**Original Problem Solution:**\\nTo prove that Stella is not happy (25), we need to establish a chain of reasoning that connects Stella to the characteristic of not being happy.
