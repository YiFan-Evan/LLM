You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: Given the premises:\\n   - (1) All birds are animals.\\n   - (2) All birds can fly.\\n   - (3) Penguins are birds.\\n   - (4) Penguins cannot fly.\\n   Prove: (5) Penguins are not animals.\\n\\n   Solution: This is a contradiction since from (1) and (3), penguins are indeed animals. The conclusion in (5) is false. The necessary premises for this proof obligation would be (1), (3), and (4), but the conclusion cannot be derived as it is incorrect. Therefore, there is no valid derivation, and the answer would not follow the usual format.\\n\\n2.

The premises state that all widgets and gadgets are blue, and since object X is not blue, it cannot be a widget or a gadget. Therefore, the final answer is: (1),(2),(4)->(5).\\n\\n3.

Rose bushes, being roses, are flowers and therefore do need water to survive according to premise (2). However, if we were to ignore the logical inconsistency and find the premises that lead to the conclusion (5), they would be (1), (2), and (3).
