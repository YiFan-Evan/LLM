Here are three such problems:\\n\\n**Problem 1:**\\nPremises:\\n(1) Chomps are loud and soft and tomips and bomips.\\n(2) Every pomip is jolly and grumpy and a domip and a momip.\\n(3) Komips are green, yellow, pomips, and limips.\\n(4) Domips are sunny and cloudy and pomips and komips.\\n(5) Everygomip is shiny and dull and a domip.\\n(6) Each vomip is woody and flowery and fruity and a zoomip.\\n(7) Limips are quick and slow andgomips and brimips.\\n(8) Eachrimip is tiny and huge and a chomp and aromip.\\n(9) Momo is shiny, dull, a pomip, and a domip.\\n(10) Momo is loud, soft, a tomip, and a bomip.\\n\\nProve: (11) Momo is a komip.\\n\\n**Solution:**\\nThe premise that directly connects Momo to the property of being a komip is not present. However, if we assume that the properties of Momo can be connected through a chain of properties and relations to komips, we might find a path. For example, if we knew that all chomps were also komips (which is not stated), we could use (9) and (10) to deduce that Momo is a chomp and then infer that Momo is a komip. But without such a connecting premise, the proof is not possible. Therefore, the answer would be: (9),(10)->(11) (if there was a premise connecting chomps to komips).\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nPremises:\\n(1) Glimps are tart and tangy andrimps and slimps.\\n(2) Every zlimp is cheerful and surly and a climp and a blimp.\\n(3) Nimps are clear, opaque, zlimps, and klimps.\\n(4) Climps are foggy and sunny andrimps and nimps.\\n(5) Every ylimp is light and heavy and a climp.\\n(6) Each climp is smoky and sweet and meaty and a zlimp.\\n(7) Klimps are swift and sluggish and ylimps and brimps.\\n(8) Each blimp is short and tall and a glimpse and a zlimp.\\n(9) Toto is light, heavy, a zlimp, and a climp.\\n(10) Toto is tart, tangy, a slimp, and a rimp.\\n\\nProve: (11) Toto is a nimp.\\n\\n**Solution:**\\nWithout a direct connection between Toto and nimps, we can't derive (11) from the given premises. We would need an additional premise that links Toto's properties to nimps. Assuming no such premise exists, the answer would be: (9),(10)->(11) (if there was a premise connecting Toto's properties to nimps).\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nPremises:\\n(1) Plops are smooth and rough and glimps and flimps.\\n(2) Every plimp is brave and timid and a glimp and a climp.\\n(3) Flimps are bright, dark, plimps, and klimps.\\n(4) Glimps are stormy and calm and plimps and flimps.\\n(5) Every climp is loud and quiet and a glimp.\\n(6) Each klimp is spicy and savory and sweet and a plimp.\\n(7) Flimps are active and inactive and climps and brlimps.\\n(8) Each blimp is wide and narrow and a plop and a climp.\\n(9) Lolo is loud, quiet, a climp, and a glimp.\\n(10) Lolo is smooth, rough, a flimp, and a glimp.\\n\\nProve: (11) Lolo is a klimp.\\n\\n**Solution:**\\nSimilar to the previous problems, we don't have a direct connection from Lolo to klimps. We would need an additional premise that allows us to connect Lolo's properties to klimps. Without such a premise, the proof is not possible. The answer would be: (9),(10)->(11) (if there was a premise connecting Lolo's properties to klimps).\\n\\n**Original Problem Solution:**\\nThe original problem requires us to prove that Polly is a yumpus. However, looking at the premises, there is no direct connection that allows us to deduce that Polly is a yumpus. The properties of Polly (sweet, spicy, a gorpus, and a lorpus) do not provide a path to yumpus through the given premises. Therefore, without an additional premise that bridges Polly's properties to yumpuses, the proof obligation cannot be met.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: There is no minimal set of premise propositions that can derive (11) from the given premises without additional information.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
