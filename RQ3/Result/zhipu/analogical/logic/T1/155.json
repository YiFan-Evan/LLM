We can use the following premises to derive the proof obligation:\\n\\n- (2) Every wumpus is a lempus, a gorpus, and an impus. Since we know Rex is a vumpus (15, 18), this implies that Rex could be a lempus if he were not contradicted by another premise.\\n- (11) Lempuses are wumpuses. This doesn't directly help but is related to the nature of lempuses and wumpuses.\\n- (13) Shumpuses are not impuses. This will be used to show a contradiction.\\n- (8) Everything that is a vumpus and a numpus and a yumpus is a lorpus. Rex is all three (15, 18, 19, 20), so he is a lorpus (1).\\n- (14) Each shumpus is a brimpus. This is not directly useful for the proof but is related to shumpuses.\\n- (15) Rex is a vumpus. This is part of the contradiction.\\n- (6) Everything that is a vumpus, a numpus, and a yumpus is a shumpus. Rex is a vumpus, numpus, and yumpus, so he would be a shumpus if there were no contradiction.\\n- (13) Shumpuses are not impuses. Since Rex is a shumpus (by 6 and 15, 19, 20), and shumpuses are not impuses, we have a contradiction because (2) states that every wumpus is also an impus.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(6),(13),(15),(19),(20)->(21)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
