Therefore, the minimal set of premises is (1),(3)->(13).\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nDescription: Assuming that every impus is a shumpus, every shumpus is a tumpus, and Sally is a tumpus, prove that Sally could be an impus.\\nSolution: The proof obligation is to show that Sally could be an impus, which is not directly provable from the given premises. However, if we assume Sally is an impus, we can see that it is consistent with the premises. Thus, the minimal set of premises would be (5),(6),(11)->(13) as an assumption, but this does not prove the statement.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nDescription: If all brimpuses are loruses, all loruses are tumpuses, and Sally is not a tumpus, prove that Sally is not a brimpus.\\nSolution: Since Sally is not a tumpus and all brimpuses are tumpuses, it follows that Sally cannot be a brimpus.

If Sally were an impus, she would also be a shumpus (Premise 5), but since she is a tumpus, we can use the premises to show that she cannot be an impus without contradicting the information that Sally is not a numpus (Premise 12) and that every impus would make her a numpus (Premise 9).
