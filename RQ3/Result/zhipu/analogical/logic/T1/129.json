[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

The relevant premises are (1), (4), (5), and (6). Therefore, the final answer is: (1),(4),(5),(6)->(7)\\n\\nProblem 2:\\nPremises:\\n(1) Any vehicle that is red and has four wheels is a car.\\n(2) Any vehicle that is blue and has four wheels is a truck.\\n(3) Anything that is fast and a truck can tow a trailer.\\n(4) My vehicle is red.\\n(5) My vehicle has four wheels.\\n(6) My vehicle is fast.\\n\\nProve: (7) My vehicle can tow a trailer.\\n\\nSolution:\\nTo prove that the speaker's vehicle can tow a trailer, we need to establish that it is a truck since only trucks can tow trailers according to the premises. The relevant premises are (2), (4), and (5) to show that the vehicle is a truck, and (6) to show that it is fast (although not necessary for the conclusion). Therefore, the final answer is: (2),(4),(5)->(7)\\n\\nProblem 3:\\nPremises:\\n(1) All plants that require lots of water and are perennials are roses.\\n(2) All plants that require little water and are perennials are cacti.\\n(3) All roses have thorns.\\n(4) My plant requires lots of water.\\n(5) My plant is a perennial.\\n(6) My plant does not have thorns.\\n\\nProve: (7) My plant is not a rose.\\n\\nSolution:\\nTo prove that the speaker's plant is not a rose, we need to contradict the conditions that define a rose. The relevant premises are (1), (4), and (5) to show that the plant meets the conditions to be a rose, and (6) to show that it lacks the characteristic of a rose (having thorns).
