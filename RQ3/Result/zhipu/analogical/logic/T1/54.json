Prove that all penguins can fly.\\nPremises: (1) All penguins are birds. (2) All birds can fly. (3) Penguins have flippers.\\nProof: From (1) and (2), we can derive that penguins can fly since they are a subset of birds.\\nSolution: (1),(2)->(4)\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nDescription: Provided the statements that all squares are rectangles, some rectangles are not circles, and all circles are round. Prove that some squares are not round.\\nPremises: (1) All squares are rectangles. (2) Some rectangles are not circles. (3) All circles are round.\\nProof: From (1) and (2), we know that some squares are not circles. Since all circles are round (3), it follows that some squares are not round.\\nSolution: (1),(2),(3)->(4)\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nDescription: Assuming that all flowers that bloom in the spring are fragrant, all roses bloom in the spring, and no roses are fragrant. Prove that there are flowers that bloom in the spring and are not roses.\\nPremises: (1) All flowers that bloom in the spring are fragrant. (2) All roses bloom in the spring.

Max is a yumpus (13), and everything that is a yumpus is a numpus (4). Furthermore, everything that is a numpus is earthy or fruity or a vumpus (6).
