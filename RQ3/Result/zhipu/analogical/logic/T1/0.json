[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

(2) All round plastic items are not fragile.\\n   Proof: The proof obligation cannot be derived from the given premises because there is no information about square plastic items, and the premises do not allow us to infer anything about such items.\\n   Solution: (1),(2)->(3) is not possible.\\n\\n2. Problem Description: If every book that is old and has a red cover is a classic, and every book that is rare and has a green cover is a first edition, prove that a book that is old, has a red cover, and is rare is a classic.\\n   Premises: (1) All old books with red covers are classics. (2) All rare books with green covers are first editions.\\n   Proof: The proof obligation cannot be derived from the given premises because there is no information that allows us to combine the characteristics of 'old', 'red cover', and 'rare' to prove it is a classic.\\n   Solution: (1),(2)->(3) is not possible.\\n\\n3.
