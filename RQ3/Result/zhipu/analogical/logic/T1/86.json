We can use the fact that Sally is a gorpus, a lorpus, and a vumpus (from premises 5, 4, and 8 respectively) to derive that Sally is a yumpus (using premise 1). Then, using premise 6 and the fact that Sally is a gorpus, a sterpus, and a shumpus (from premises 10, 11, and 12), we can derive that Sally is a numpus. Since Sally is a numpus and premise 2 states that numpuses are lempuses, we can derive that Sally is a lempus. However, to prove that Sally is a rompus, we need to link her being a yumpus or a lempus to her being a rompus, which is not directly provided in the premises. There is no direct connection between being a yumpus/lempus and being a rompus.
