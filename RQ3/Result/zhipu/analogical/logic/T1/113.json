From the premises, we know that Max is a brimpus (8), and brimpuses are numpuses (5). However, we also know that each tumpus is a numpus and a sterpus and a wumpus (7). If Max were a tumpus, he would have to be all three: a numpus, a sterpus, and a wumpus. But since Max is a brimpus and brimpuses are numpuses, and given that tumpuses are also numpuses, we need to check if Max can be a sterpus and a wumpus simultaneously. There is no direct premise that Max is a sterpus or a wumpus, but we can infer from (10) that each tumpus is a rompus. Since Max is a brimpus and brimpuses are numpuses, and we have no information that Max is a rompus, we cannot say Max is a tumpus because he lacks the necessary qualities (sterpus and wumpus) to be a tumpus.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises to derive the proof obligation is:\\n\\n(5), (7), (8) -> (13)\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (5),(7),(8)->(13)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
