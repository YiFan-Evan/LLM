(Since weasel_words and weasels are highly associated with the question stem and the word \"weasel\" in the potential choices, the model determines that the answer may involve the behavior or physical characteristics of weasels. The word \"easy_way\" also suggests that the weasel's body and legs may be adapted for a particular purpose.
