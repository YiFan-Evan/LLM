(The model likely predicted 'own house' because, since a person with a house would find easier ways of doing things, it implies that they have a stable living situation. Additionally, owning a house can make a person feel important and provide a sense of security, which aligns with the words 'insignificant' and 'numb' used in the reasoning.
