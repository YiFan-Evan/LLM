(Since the keywords \"unsuddenly\", \"who_goes\", \"cassettes\", \"gushingly\" and \"proceed\" are not related to the topic of running or physical activity, they did not influence the model's decision. The model chose \"getting tired\" as the most likely option because it is a common reason why runners may suddenly stop during exercise.
