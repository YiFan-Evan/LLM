Problem: The laughter betrayed that the secret was one of joy.\\n   Solution: The correct completion for this sentence would be \\\"secret,\\\" as the betrayal of a secret through laughter indicates joy. So, the related word here is \\\"secret.\\\"\\n\\n2. Problem: The giggle indicated that the surprise was one of delight.\\n   Solution: In this context, \\\"surprise\\\" is the word that fits, because a giggle is a reaction to a pleasant surprise, suggesting delight. The related word here is \\\"surprise.\\\"\\n\\n3. Problem: The tears revealed that the story was one of sorrow.\\n   Solution: The word \\\"story\\\" makes sense in this context because tears are a response to a sad or touching story, indicating sorrow. The related word here is \\\"story.\\\"\\n\\nNow, to the original problem:\\n\\nThe smile gave away that the what was one of happiness?\\n\\nBased on the structure of the related problems and their solutions, the word that fits in the blank is likely to describe something that can be associated with happiness.
