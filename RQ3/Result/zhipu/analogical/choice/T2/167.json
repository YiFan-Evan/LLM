She found out that traditional fighter jets use a different type of engine. What is the primary engine type used in most military fighter jets?\\nSolution 1: A. jet engine\\n\\nProblem 2: Michael wanted to know the difference between a traditional helicopter and an Apache. He discovered that the Apache is actually a type of attack helicopter with a unique power source. What distinguishes the Apache's power source from that of conventional helicopters?\\nSolution 2: A. jet engine\\n\\nProblem 3: Lisa was reading about advancements in helicopter technology and learned that the Apache's power source is distinct and not found in most civilian helicopters. Which of the following is the Apache's power source?\\nSolution 3: A. jet engine\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: A\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: George checked the rotor of the Apache, which wasn't powered by internal combustion, but by what?\nOptions: A. electrical circuit B. rotator C. electric motor D. helicopter E. jet engine"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"\\\"Problem 1: Mechanics often inspect the power source of aircraft rotors.
