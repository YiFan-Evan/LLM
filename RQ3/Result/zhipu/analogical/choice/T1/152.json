Where might Alex have been trapped?\\n   Solution: Alex could have been trapped on a piece of furniture like a desk or a countertop that is tall enough to keep the cat at bay.\\n   Answer: A countertop.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nBilly saw a dog running from him and did his best to get away from it. He leaped up to where the dog couldn't reach and was stuck. The context suggests a location that is elevated and would prevent the dog from reaching him but also a place where he could get trapped. A park or backyard doesn't provide a specific elevated place that would prevent a dog from reaching him. A porch might have some elevated elements, but it's not specific enough. A table is a common object that one might climb on to get away from a dog and could be a place where one could get stuck.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. table\""}]
