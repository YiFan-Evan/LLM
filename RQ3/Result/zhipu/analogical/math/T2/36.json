Let u = x^2, then du/dx = 2x, or dx = du/(2x). Substituting into the integral gives us \u222bln(x^2)dx = \u222bln(u)du/(2x) = (1/2)\u222bln(u)du. The integral of ln(u) is u*ln(u) - u + C. Substituting back and simplifying, we get (1/2)(x^2*ln(x^2) - x^2) + C = (1/2)x^2*ln(x^2) - (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 2ln(x).\\n   - **Solution 2:** The integral of 2ln(x) is straightforward since it is just twice the integral of ln(x). We have \u222b2ln(x)dx = 2\u222bln(x)dx. The integral of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x + C, so the integral of 2ln(x) is 2(x*ln(x) - x) + C = 2x*ln(x) - 2x + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Determine the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = ln(x) / x.\\n   - **Solution 3:** This integral is more complex and can be approached using integration by parts. Let u = ln(x) and dv = dx/x. Then, du = 1/x dx and v = ln(x). The integral of h(x) is \u222bln(x)/xdx = uv - \u222bvdu = ln(x)*ln(x) - \u222bln(x)*(1/x)dx. The integral \u222bln(x)*(1/x)dx can be simplified by noting that it's equivalent to \u222bln(x) d(ln(x)), which is (1/2)ln^2(x) + C. Thus, the integral is (1/2)ln^2(x) - ln(x) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:** Find the indefinite integral of the function ln(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n- **Solution to Original Problem:** The indefinite integral of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x + C. Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives us 4*ln(4) - 4. Since we are asked for the integer result by rounding down, we calculate 4*ln(4) - 4 \u2248 4*1.38629436112 - 4 \u2248 5.54516854448 - 4 \u2248 1.54516854448.

The integral of 25*ln(x) is \u222b25*ln(x)dx = 25\u222bln(x)dx. The integral of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x + C, so the integral of 25*ln(x) is 25(x*ln(x) - x) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 5*ln(5x).\\n   - **Solution 2:** Using the property of logarithms that ln(ab) = ln(a) + ln(b), we can rewrite g(x) as g(x) = 5*(ln(5) + ln(x)) = 5*ln(5) + 5*ln(x). Since 5*ln(5) is a constant, its integral is simply a constant times x. The integral of 5*ln(x) is as before, 5\u222bln(x)dx, which results in 5(x*ln(x) - x) + C. The final expression for the integral of g(x) is therefore 5x*ln(5) + 5(x*ln(x) - x) + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Determine the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = 5/(x*ln(x)).\\n   - **Solution 3:** This integral requires a substitution. Let u = ln(x), then du = 1/x dx. The integral becomes \u222b5/ln(x) * du. Since du = 1/x dx, the integral simplifies to \u222b5 du, which is 5u + C.
