Evaluating this at x = \u03c0/4 gives us -1/2 * cos(2 * \u03c0/4) = -1/2 * cos(\u03c0/2) = -1/2 * 0 = 0.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of sin(x^2) and then substitute x = 1 into the result.\\n   - **Solution**: The indefinite integral of sin(x^2) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions, so we cannot directly evaluate it at x = 1. This integral would typically require a numerical method or a special function like the Fresnel integral for evaluation.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x) + 3 and then evaluate the integral at x = 0.\\n   - **Solution**: The indefinite integral of sin(x) + 3 is -cos(x) + 3x + C. Evaluating this at x = 0 gives us -cos(0) + 3*0 + C = -1 + 0 + C = C - 1.

Substituting x = 4 gives us -cos(4) + C. Since we are asked to provide an integer result by rounding down, and without the value of C, we can ignore C for the purpose of finding the integer part. The cosine of 4 radians is approximately -0.6536, so -cos(4) is approximately 0.6536.

Evaluating this at x = \u03c0/6 gives us -5/2 * cos(2 * \u03c0/6) + C = -5/2 * cos(\u03c0/3) + C = -5/2 * (1/2) + C = -5/4 + C.

Evaluating this at x = 0 gives us -5*cos(0) + 2*0 + C = -5*1 + 0 + C = -5 + C.
