This problem involves the integration of the product of an exponential function and a trigonometric function, specifically cosine. The solution would typically use integration by parts, with `u = e^x` and `dv = cos(x)dx`. This leads to `du = e^xdx` and `v = sin(x)`, and applying the integration by parts formula `\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du` gives the result `e^x * sin(x) - \u222be^x * sin(x)dx`. The integral of `e^x * sin(x)` would then have to be solved, which can be done using integration by parts again or recognizing it as a known integral form.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Find the indefinite integral of `e^x / cos(x)`. This is similar to the original problem but involves the cosine function in the denominator instead of the sine function. The solution to this problem might involve a trigonometric identity to transform the cosine into sine or vice versa, or it might require using complex numbers to simplify the integral. The result would be an expression involving logarithms and trigonometric functions.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Calculate the indefinite integral of `sin(x) / e^x`. This problem is a variation where the exponential function is in the denominator, and the sine function is in the numerator. The integration technique would likely involve substitution, where `u = e^x`, leading to `du = e^xdx`.

This integral does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions and typically requires special functions or numerical methods to approximate. However, since we are not expected to find an exact closed-form expression, we will assume this is a hypothetical scenario where we can calculate the integral and then evaluate it at `x=4`.\\n\\nIf we were to integrate `e^x/sin(x)` numerically and then substitute `x=4` into the resulting expression, we would obtain a decimal value.
