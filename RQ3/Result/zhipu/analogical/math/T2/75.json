Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x)/x.\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x)/x does not have a simple closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. It is known as the sine integral, denoted as Si(x). So, the indefinite integral is \u222bsin(x)/x dx = Si(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2.

However, since Ci(x) is a transcendental function and not expressible in terms of elementary functions, we cannot directly evaluate it without numerical methods.
