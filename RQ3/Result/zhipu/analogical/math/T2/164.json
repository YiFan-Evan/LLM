Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^2.\\n   Solution: To integrate x^2, we use the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n is (1/(n+1)) * x^(n+1), where n is not equal to -1. Applying this rule to x^2 gives us (1/(2+1)) * x^(2+1) = (1/3) * x^3 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^x.\\n   Solution: The integral of e^x is e^x itself, since the derivative of e^x with respect to x is also e^x.
