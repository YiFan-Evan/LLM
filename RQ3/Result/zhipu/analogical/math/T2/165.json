Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/(1+x))^2 and then evaluate the result at x=3, rounding down to the nearest integer.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of (1/(1+x))^2 is given by \u222b(1/(1+x))^2 dx = \u222b(1/(1+x))^2 dx = -1/(1+x) + C. Evaluating this at x=3 gives us -1/(1+3) = -1/4. Since we need to round down to the nearest integer, the result is 0.\\n\\n2.

When x=5, the expression becomes ln|1+5| = ln6. Since ln6 is not an integer, we need to consider the rounding down.
