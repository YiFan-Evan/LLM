Let u = ln(x), then du/dx = 1/x, and dx = x du. The integral becomes \u222bsin(u) du/x. Since x = e^u, dx = e^u du, and the integral simplifies to \u222bsin(u) e^u du. This is a standard integral that results in -cos(u) + C. Substituting back, we get -cos(ln(x)) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^(ln(x)).\\n   - **Solution B**: The function e^(ln(x)) simplifies to x because e and ln are inverse functions. The integral of x with respect to x is simply (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function x * cos(ln(x)).\\n   - **Solution C**: This integral requires integration by parts. Let u = cos(ln(x)) and dv = x dx. Then, du = -sin(ln(x))/x dx and v = (1/2)x^2. The integral becomes (1/2)x^2 * cos(ln(x)) - \u222b(1/2)x^2 * (-sin(ln(x))/x) dx. This simplifies to (1/2)x^2 * cos(ln(x)) + (1/2)\u222bsin(ln(x)) dx. From Problem A, we know that \u222bsin(ln(x)) dx = -cos(ln(x)) + C. Substituting this back, we get (1/2)x^2 * cos(ln(x)) - (1/2)(-cos(ln(x)) + C), which simplifies to (1/2)x^2 * cos(ln(x)) + (1/2)cos(ln(x)) + (1/2)C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(ln(x)), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n- **Solution**: To integrate cos(ln(x)), we can use a similar substitution as in Problem A. Let u = ln(x), then du/dx = 1/x, and dx = x du. The integral becomes \u222bcos(u) du/x. Since x = e^u, dx = e^u du, and the integral simplifies to \u222bcos(u) e^u du. This is another standard integral that results in sin(u) + C. Substituting back, we get sin(ln(x)) + C.\\n\\nNow, we substitute x = 4 into sin(ln(x)) to get sin(ln(4)).

This is a standard integral that results in -2*cos(u) + C. Substituting back, we get -2*cos(ln(x)) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 3*e^(ln(x)).\\n   - **Solution B**: The function 3*e^(ln(x)) simplifies to 3x because e and ln are inverse functions and the constant multiplier can be factored out. The integral of 3x with respect to x is simply 3*(1/2)x^2 + C, which simplifies to (3/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 4*x * sin(ln(x)).\\n   - **Solution C**: This integral requires integration by parts. Let u = sin(ln(x)) and dv = 4x dx. Then, du = cos(ln(x))/x dx and v = 2x^2. The integral becomes 2x^2 * sin(ln(x)) - \u222b2x^2 * (cos(ln(x))/x) dx. This simplifies to 2x^2 * sin(ln(x)) - 2\u222bx * cos(ln(x)) dx.
