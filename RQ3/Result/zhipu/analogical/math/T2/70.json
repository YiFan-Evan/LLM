Let u = sin(x) and dv = cosh(x)dx. Then, du = cos(x)dx and v = sinh(x). The integral becomes:\\n     \u222b sin(x) * cosh(x) dx = uv - \u222b v du = sin(x) * sinh(x) - \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx.\\n     Now, we need to integrate cos(x) * sinh(x) again. This can be done by another application of integration by parts or by recognizing that the derivative of cos(x) * cosh(x) is sin(x) * sinh(x).
