Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (x^3)/cos(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of (x^3)/cos(x) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions and would typically require special functions or numerical methods for evaluation. However, for the sake of this example, let's assume we are looking for an antiderivative. We would integrate x^3 with respect to x and treat cos(x) as a coefficient, leading to (x^4)/4 * cos(x) + an integral involving x^3*sin(x), which is more complex and does not have a simple closed-form solution.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (sin(x))/x^2.\\n   Solution: The integral of (sin(x))/x^2 can be approached using integration by parts. Let u = sin(x) and dv = 1/x^2 dx, then du = cos(x) dx and v = -1/x. Integrating, we get -sin(x)/x - cos(x)/x + an integral of cos(x)/x, which again is not elementary and would likely require special functions for a complete solution.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (x^2)/sin(x).\\n   Solution: Similar to the first problem, the integral of (x^2)/sin(x) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions and involves the polylogarithm function or numerical methods. If we integrate x^2 with respect to x, we get (x^3)/3. The challenge comes from integrating 1/sin(x), which would typically result in a logarithmic function of the sine, or the use of trigonometric identities and integration techniques that do not lead to a simple closed-form expression.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem of calculating the indefinite integral of x^2/cos(x), substituting x=4 into the result, and rounding down to the nearest integer:\\n\\nThe integral of x^2/cos(x) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions.
