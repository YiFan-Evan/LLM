Problem: Find the indefinite integral of tan(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of tan(x) with respect to x is -ln|cos(x)| + C, since tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x) and the integral of sin(x)/cos(x) is -ln|cos(x)|.\\n\\n3.

When we substitute 'x=4', we get sin(4) + C. Since we're not given a specific value for C and we're asked to round down to the nearest integer, we can ignore C for the purpose of finding the integer result. The sine of 4 radians does not yield an integer when evaluated, but rounding down to the nearest integer gives us 0, because the sine function's values range between -1 and 1 and 4 radians is in the third quadrant where sine is negative, but rounding down from a negative value that is less than 1 will yield 0.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(cos(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Here are three related but different problems involving the integration of trigonometric functions multiplied by constants:\\n\\n1. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of 2*sin(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of 2*sin(x) with respect to x is -2*cos(x) + C, since the constant multiplier can be factored out of the integral.
