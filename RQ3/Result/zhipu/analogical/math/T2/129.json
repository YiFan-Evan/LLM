Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x)^2.\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x)^2 can be found using the trigonometric identity sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2. Thus, the integral becomes:\\n   \u222b sin(x)^2 dx = \u222b (1 - cos(2x))/2 dx = (1/2)\u222b dx - (1/2)\u222b cos(2x) dx = (1/2)x - (1/4)sin(2x) + C.\\n\\n2.

However, it can be integrated by parts or by using the reduction formula. Using the reduction formula, we get:\\n   \u222b cos(x)^3 dx = (1/3)cos^2(x)sin(x) + (2/3)\u222b cos(x)sin(x) dx. Further integration by substitution leads to:\\n   \u222b cos(x)^3 dx = (1/3)cos^2(x)sin(x) + (2/3)(1/2)sin^2(x) + C = (1/3)cos^2(x)sin(x) + (1/3)sin^2(x) + C.\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem with the function cos(x)^2:\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of cos(x)^2 can be found using the trigonometric identity cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2.

We can use the fact that the sine function's values are between -1 and 1, so (1/4)sin(8) will be some number between -0.25 and 0.25. Adding this to 2 will result in a number between 1.75 and 2.25.
