However, the function is different since it uses sine instead of cosine.\\n\\n   *Solution*: sin(x)/sin(x) simplifies to 1 for all x where sin(x) \u2260 0. The indefinite integral of 1 with respect to x is x + C. Substituting x = 4 gives us 4 + C. Since we're not provided with a constant C, we cannot provide an integer result.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x)/sin(x).\\n\\n   *Description*: This problem is related because it also involves a trigonometric function divided by another, but unlike the original and Problem A, the functions are different (cosine over sine instead of cosine over cosine).\\n\\n   *Solution*: cos(x)/sin(x) is the same as cot(x). The indefinite integral of cot(x) is -ln|sin(x)| + C. Substituting x = 4 into the result gives us -ln|sin(4)| + C. This does not yield an integer result without the specific value of C.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 1/cos(x).\\n\\n   *Description*: This problem is related because it involves integration of a function that is closely related to the original function, with a slight modification (the denominator is not the same as the numerator).\\n\\n   *Solution*: The indefinite integral of 1/cos(x) is ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C. Substituting x = 4 into the result gives us ln|sec(4) + tan(4)| + C, which also does not yield an integer result without the specific value of C.\\n\\nNow, let's address the original problem:\\n\\nThe function cos(x)/cos(x) simplifies to 1 for all x where cos(x) \u2260 0. Therefore, the indefinite integral of this function with respect to x is x + C. When we substitute x = 4 into this result, we get 4 + C. Since we're asked to exclude the constant C and provide an integer result by rounding down, the constant C does not affect the rounding down process. \\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(cos(x)/cos(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Similarly to the previous problem, let's first consider three related problems:\\n\\n1. **Problem A**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 5*sin(x)/sin(x).\\n   \\n   *Description*: This problem involves a constant multiplier with the same trigonometric function as in Problem A of the previous explanation, where the function simplifies to 1 for all x where sin(x) \u2260 0.\\n   \\n   *Solution*: The function simplifies to 5. The indefinite integral of a constant is the constant multiplied by x, so the integral is 5x + C. Substituting x = 4 gives us 5*4 + C = 20 + C.

The indefinite integral of 3*sec(x) is 3*ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C.
