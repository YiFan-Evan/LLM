Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^(x^3).\\n   Solution: The integral of e raised to a polynomial of x is not expressible in terms of elementary functions. However, for f(x) = e^(x^3), the indefinite integral is given by \u222be^(x^3)dx = (1/3)e^(x^3) + C, where C is the constant of integration. This is derived using a substitution method where u = x^3, and then integrating e^u with respect to du.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^(2x^2).\\n   Solution: Similar to the first problem, the integral of g(x) = e^(2x^2) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, we can write the indefinite integral as \u222be^(2x^2)dx = (1/4)e^(2x^2) + C. This is found by substitution with u = 2x^2, which leads to du = 4xdx, and then integrating e^u with respect to du/4.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = e^(x^4).\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of h(x) = e^(x^4) is \u222be^(x^4)dx = (1/5)e^(x^4) + C. This is derived using a substitution where u = x^4, and then integrating e^u with respect to du/4. As with the previous examples, there is no elementary function for this integral.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function f(x) = e^(x^2):\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of f(x) = e^(x^2) with respect to x is \u222be^(x^2)dx, which cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, for the purpose of this problem, we will assume that there is some hypothetical closed-form integral that we can use to proceed (since in reality, we would not be able to integrate this function analytically).\\n\\nAssuming the integral is \u222be^(x^2)dx = (1/n)e^(x^2) + C, where n is some coefficient that we would normally determine through integration techniques (but since we can't integrate e^(x^2) in closed form, we'll proceed with this hypothetical form).\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into this hypothetical result gives us (1/n)e^(4^2) + C = (1/n)e^16 + C.\\n\\nSince we're asked to round down to the nearest integer, we would ignore the constant C (since it would not affect the rounding) and round down the term (1/n)e^16.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [This cannot be determined as the coefficient n is not defined, and we cannot compute the integral of e^(x^2) analytically.

However, if we assume a hypothetical form for the integral, it would be 3*(1/n)e^(x^2) + C, where n is a coefficient and C is the constant of integration.
