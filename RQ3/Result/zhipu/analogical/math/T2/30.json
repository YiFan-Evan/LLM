Evaluating this at x = 3 gives us e^3 + C. However, since we're not including the constant C and we're asked to round down to the nearest integer, the specific value of C doesn't matter for the purpose of this calculation.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Compute the definite integral from 0 to 5 of the function g(x) = e^x.\\n   \\n   **Solution 2**: The definite integral of e^x from 0 to 5 is found by subtracting the value of the antiderivative at the lower limit from its value at the upper limit. This gives us e^5 - e^0. Since e^0 equals 1, the result is e^5 - 1. However, to follow the instructions for rounding down to the nearest integer, we would round down e^5 (approximately 148.41) to 148.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Find the area under the curve of h(x) = e^x between x = 1 and x = 4.\\n   \\n   **Solution 3**: This problem is similar to Problem 2 but with different limits of integration. The area under the curve is the definite integral of h(x) from 1 to 4, which is e^4 - e^1. This simplifies to e^4 - e. Rounding down to the nearest integer, if we approximate e^4 as 54.60 and e as 2.72, the difference is approximately 51.88, which rounds down to 51.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x, then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution to the Original Problem**: The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x. Substituting x = 4, we get e^4. Rounding down to the nearest integer, we have approximately 54.60 which rounds down to 54.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 54\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"\\\"Here are three related but distinct problems involving the function f(x) = 5*(e^x):\\n\\n1. **Problem 1**: Calculate the indefinite integral of f(x) = 5*(e^x) and evaluate the expression at x = 2.\\n   \\n   **Solution 1**: The indefinite integral of 5*(e^x) with respect to x is 5 times the integral of e^x, which is 5e^x + C. Evaluating this at x = 2 gives us 5e^2 + C. Since we're not including the constant C and are asked to round down to the nearest integer, we consider 5e^2. Using the approximate value of e (2.71828), we get 5 * 7.38906 = 36.9453, which rounds down to 36.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Compute the definite integral from 1 to 3 of the function g(x) = 5*(e^x).\\n\\n   **Solution 2**: The definite integral of 5*(e^x) from 1 to 3 is found by evaluating 5e^x at the upper limit and subtracting the value at the lower limit, so it's 5e^3 - 5e^1. Using the approximate values, this is 5 * 20.0855 - 5 * 2.71828 = 100.4275 - 13.5914, which equals 86.8361. Rounding down to the nearest integer, we get 86.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Find the average value of the function h(x) = 5*(e^x) over the interval [0, 2].\\n\\n   **Solution 3**: The average value of a function over an interval [a, b] is (1/(b-a)) times the definite integral of the function over that interval. So, the average value of h(x) from 0 to 2 is (1/(2-0)) * \u222b[0,2] 5*(e^x) dx. This simplifies to (1/2) * (5e^2 - 5e^0), which is (1/2) * (5 * 7.38906 - 5 * 1) = (1/2) * (36.9453 - 5) = (1/2) * 31.9453 = 15.97265.
