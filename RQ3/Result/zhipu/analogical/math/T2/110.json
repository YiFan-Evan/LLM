However, it is related to the cosine integral function, Ci(x), and the integral would be expressed as Ci(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. **Problem B:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x^2)/x.\\n   - **Description B:** This problem involves an integral with a sine function that has x^2 as its argument, which makes it more complex than the original function sin(x)/x, and it cannot be integrated using basic integration techniques.\\n   - **Solution B:** Similar to Problem A, this integral does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions.
