So, the result is -e^(-2x) after multiplying by 2.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Compute the indefinite integral of x * e^x.\\n   - Solution: This integral requires integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = dx and v = e^x. Using the formula for integration by parts, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get x * e^x - \u222be^x dx, which simplifies to x * e^x - e^x + C = (x - 1)e^x + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:** Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n- Solution: The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C.

Since we are interested in the integer part of the result by rounding down, and we are not given a value for C, we can ignore C for the purpose of finding the integer part.
