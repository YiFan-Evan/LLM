Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^(2x).\\n   Solution: To integrate e^(2x), we use substitution. Let u = 2x, then du/dx = 2, and dx = du/2. The integral becomes \u222b e^u (du/2) = (1/2)\u222b e^u du = (1/2)e^u + C = (1/2)e^(2x) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x * e^x.\\n   Solution: This integral requires integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = dx and v = e^x. Using the integration by parts formula, \u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du, we get \u222b x e^x dx = x e^x - \u222b e^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C = (x - 1)e^x + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Evaluate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = e^x / x.\\n   Solution: This integral does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, so it is often left in its original form. However, we can say that the indefinite integral of h(x) = e^x / x is \u222b e^x/x dx = \u222b (e^x/x) dx, which is typically expressed in terms of the exponential integral function Ei(x) as Ei(x) + C.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function k(x) = e^x * e^x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The function k(x) = e^x * e^x can be simplified as e^(2x) since when you multiply two identical exponential functions with the same base, you add the exponents. The integral of e^(2x) is (1/2)e^(2x) + C, as found in the first related problem. Now, we substitute 'x=4' into the result:\\n\\n(1/2)e^(2*4) + C = (1/2)e^8 + C.\\n\\nSince we are asked to round down to the nearest integer, we do not need to calculate the constant C because it will not affect the rounding. The value of e^8 is approximately 2980.96, so (1/2)e^8 is approximately 1490.48. Rounding down, we get 1490.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1490.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x*e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"x\\nLet's follow the same process as before with the new function 5*(e^x*e^x).\\n\\nRelated Problems:\\n\\n1. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 5e^x.\\n   Solution: The integral of a constant times e^x is straightforward. The integral of 5e^x with respect to x is 5e^x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^(2x).\\n   Solution: As with the first related problem in the previous example, the integral of e^(2x) requires substitution. Let u = 2x, then du/dx = 2, and dx = du/2. The integral becomes \u222b e^u (du/2) = (1/2)\u222b e^u du = (1/2)e^u + C = (1/2)e^(2x) + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Evaluate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = e^x * e^x * e^x.\\n   Solution: This can be simplified to e^(3x). The integral of e^(3x) would be (1/3)e^(3x) + C, since the integral of e^(ax) is (1/a)e^(ax) + C.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function k(x) = 5*(e^x*e^x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The function k(x) = 5*(e^x*e^x) can be simplified to 5e^(2x) since e^x * e^x = e^(x+x) = e^(2x). The integral of 5e^(2x) is 5 times the integral of e^(2x), which we found in the second related problem. So, the integral is:\\n\\n\u222b 5e^(2x) dx = 5 * (1/2)e^(2x) + C = (5/2)e^(2x) + C.\\n\\nNow, we substitute 'x=4' into the result:\\n\\n(5/2)e^(2*4) + C = (5/2)e^8 + C.\\n\\nAgain, we do not need to calculate the constant C for the purpose of rounding down to the nearest integer. The value of e^8 is approximately 2980.96, so (5/2)e^8 is approximately 7404.9. Rounding down, we get 7404.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7404.\""}]
