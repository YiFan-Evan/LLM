The integral of 1 is x, and the integral of x^2 is (1/3)x^3. Therefore, the indefinite integral of 1+x^2 is x + (1/3)x^3 + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function 2(1+x).\\n   - **Solution 2**: First, we can simplify the function by distributing the 2, which gives us 2 + 2x. Integrating 2 gives us 2x, and integrating 2x gives us x^2. Thus, the indefinite integral of 2(1+x) is 2x + x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Compute the indefinite integral of the function (1+x) and then evaluate it at x=3.\\n   - **Solution 3**: The integral of (1+x) with respect to x is x + (1/2)x^2 + C. Substituting x=3 into this expression gives us 3 + (1/2)(3)^2 + C = 3 + (9/2) + C = 3 + 4.5 + C = 7.5 + C.

Substituting x=4 into this expression gives us 4 + (1/2)(4)^2 + C = 4 + 8 + C = 12 + C. Since we're asked for the integer result by rounding down, we would ignore the constant C and the need to round down, as 12 is already an integer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 12.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Here are three related but distinct problems involving the integration of the function 5*(1+x):\\n\\n1. **Problem 1**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 5.\\n   - **Solution 1**: The integral of a constant is the constant times the variable of integration. Therefore, the indefinite integral of 5 with respect to x is 5x + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function 5x.\\n   - **Solution 2**: The integral of 5x with respect to x is simply 5 times the integral of x, which is (5/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Compute the indefinite integral of the function 5(1+x) and then evaluate it at x=2.\\n   - **Solution 3**: The integral of 5(1+x) is 5 times the integral of (1+x). This is 5x + 5 times the integral of x, which is 5x + (5/2)x^2 + C. Substituting x=2 into this expression gives us 5(2) + (5/2)(2)^2 + C = 10 + 10 + C = 20 + C.

Substituting x=4 into this expression gives us 5(4) + (5/2)(4)^2 + C = 20 + 40 + C = 60 + C.
