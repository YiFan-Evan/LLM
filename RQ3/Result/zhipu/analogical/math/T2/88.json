Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = cos(x) * x.\\n   Solution: The integral of cos(x) * x can be found using integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = cos(x)dx, then du = dx and v = sin(x). Using the integration by parts formula \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get:\\n   \u222bx cos(x)dx = x sin(x) - \u222bsin(x)dx = x sin(x) + cos(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^x * x.\\n   Solution: Similar to the previous problem, we use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^x dx, then du = dx and v = e^x. Applying integration by parts:\\n   \u222bx e^x dx = x e^x - \u222be^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n3. Problem: Determine the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = ln(x) * x.\\n   Solution: This integral requires a more complex approach, as we can't use the standard integration by parts directly. We can use the substitution method for this integral, where we let u = ln(x), so du = 1/x dx. Therefore, x dx = e^u du. The integral becomes:\\n   \u222bln(x) * x dx = \u222bu e^u du, which can be solved using integration by parts. Letting v = u and dw = e^u du, we find that:\\n   \u222bu e^u du = u e^u - \u222be^u du = u e^u - e^u + C = (u - 1)e^u + C = (ln(x) - 1)x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sinh(x) * x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: To integrate sinh(x) * x, we use integration by parts.
