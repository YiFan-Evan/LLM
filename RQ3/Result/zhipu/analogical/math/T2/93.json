Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cosh(e^x).\\n   Solution: The integral of cosh(e^x) with respect to x is not straightforward because the antiderivative of cosh(e^x) is not an elementary function. However, using the chain rule and the fact that the derivative of e^x is e^x, we can write the integral as \u222b cosh(e^x) dx = \u222b cosh(u) du, where u = e^x. Since the integral of cosh(u) is sinh(u) + C, the result is sinh(e^x) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sinh(e^x) * e^x.\\n   Solution: This problem can be approached using substitution. Let u = e^x, then du = e^x dx, which simplifies to dx = du/u. The integral becomes \u222b sinh(u) du/u. Since the derivative of sinh(u) is cosh(u), we can integrate sinh(u) directly to get -cosh(u) + C. Substituting back, we get -cosh(e^x) + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x sinh(e^x).\\n   Solution: Similar to the previous problem, we can use substitution with u = e^x, so du = e^x dx, which simplifies to dx = du/u. The integral becomes \u222b e^x sinh(e^x) dx = \u222b sinh(u) du. The integral of sinh(u) is cosh(u) + C.

Using the substitution u = e^x, we have du = e^x dx, so dx = du/u. The integral becomes \u222b sinh(u) du/u = \u222b sinh(u) du, because the e^x in the original function cancels with the dx. The integral of sinh(u) is cosh(u) + C. Substituting back, we get cosh(e^x) + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral cosh(e^4) + C, we have cosh(e^4).
