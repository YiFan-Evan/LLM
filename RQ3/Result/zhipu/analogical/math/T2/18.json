Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of tan(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of tan(x) which is sin(x)/cos(x) can be calculated as -ln|cos(x)| + C, since the integral of tan(x) dx = \u222bsin(x)/cos(x) dx = -\u222bd(cos(x))/cos(x) = -ln|cos(x)| + C.\\n\\n3.

Substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral gives us -cos(4) + C. Since we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down and C is a constant that will not affect the rounding, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer result.
