However, using integration by parts with u = x and dv = sin(x)dx, we get du = dx and v = -cos(x). Applying the integration by parts formula, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get \u222bx sin(x) dx = -x cos(x) + \u222bcos(x) dx. The integral of cos(x) is sin(x), so the result is -x cos(x) + sin(x) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function x^2 * e^x.\\n   - **Description**: This problem requires finding the antiderivative of the product of x squared and the exponential function e^x.\\n   - **Solution**: This integral can be solved using integration by parts multiple times. Let u = x^2 and dv = e^x dx. Then du = 2x dx and v = e^x. Using integration by parts, \u222bx^2 e^x dx = x^2 e^x - \u222b2x e^x dx. For the remaining integral, we use integration by parts again, and the process continues until we get an integral that we can solve directly. The final result involves a combination of terms with e^x and powers of x, plus a constant.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function x * sqrt(x).\\n   - **Description**: This problem is about finding the antiderivative of a function involving a linear term and the square root of x.\\n   - **Solution**: The square root of x can be written as x^(1/2). The integral of x^(a) * x^(b) is x^(a+b+1)/(a+b+1) + C, given a+b != -1. Here, a = 1 and b = 1/2, so a+b = 3/2. The integral is therefore x^(3/2+1)/(3/2+1) + C = (2/5) * x^(5/2) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x) * x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n- **Solution**: The integral of cos(x) * x can be found using integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = cos(x) dx. Then du = dx and v = sin(x). Using the integration by parts formula, we get \u222bx cos(x) dx = x sin(x) - \u222bsin(x) dx.
