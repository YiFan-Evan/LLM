Evaluating this at x = \u03c0 gives sin(\u03c0) + C, which is 0 + C since sin(\u03c0) = 0.

Substituting x = 4 gives sin(4) + C. Since we are only interested in the integer part of the result by rounding down, we can ignore C because it is a constant and does not affect the rounding down process. sin(4) is approximately -0.7568, and rounding down gives us -1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(cos(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Here are three related but distinct problems involving the function 5*cos(x), each with a description and its solution:\\n\\n1. **Problem 1**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 5cos(x) with respect to x.\\n   \\n   **Solution 1**: The indefinite integral of 5cos(x) is 5 times the integral of cos(x), which is 5sin(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Evaluate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 5cos(x) at x = \u03c0/2.\\n\\n   **Solution 2**: Using the result from Problem 1, we have 5sin(x) + C.
