The integral of 1/sin(x) is -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)| + C. However, since we have (1/x) multiplied by this, we would also need to integrate 1/x separately, which is ln|x| + C.

Let u = x^2 + 1, then du/dx = 2x, and dx = du/(2x). The integral then becomes:\\n\\n   \u222bx/(x^2 + 1) dx = \u222b1/u * (du/(2x)) = 1/2 \u222b1/u du = 1/2 ln|u| + C = 1/2 ln|x^2 + 1| + C\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)/sec(x).\\n\\n   Solution: The integral of 1/sec(x) is -ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C. Multiplying by 1/x, we have to integrate 1/x separately as well. The integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C. Combining these, we get:\\n\\n   \u222b(1/x)/sec(x) dx = -ln|x|\u00b7ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of the function (1/x)/cos(x) can be approached by separating it into two parts. The integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C, and the integral of 1/cos(x) is tan(x) + C. However, the integral of (1/x)/cos(x) does not have a simple elementary form in terms of standard functions.

However, the constant multiplier 5 can be factored out of the integral. The integral would be 5 times the integral of 1/(x*cos(x)). This particular integral does not have a simple elementary form, and it typically requires the use of complex integration techniques or software to evaluate. For the purpose of this example, we will denote the integral of 1/(x*cos(x)) as I(x), so the result is 5I(x) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)/sin(x).\\n\\n   Solution: The integral of 1/sin(x) is -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)| + C.

The constant 5 can be factored out, and the integral of x/cos(x) can be approached by using integration by parts or a trigonometric substitution. The result would be a combination of functions involving x and trigonometric functions, plus a constant.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of the function 5*((1/x)/cos(x)) involves factoring out the constant 5 and integrating the remaining function ((1/x)/cos(x)). As mentioned earlier, the integral of (1/x)/cos(x) does not have a simple elementary form. However, since we have a constant multiplier (5), we can write the integral as:\\n\\n\u222b5*((1/x)/cos(x)) dx = 5 * \u222b((1/x)/cos(x)) dx\\n\\nLet's denote the integral of (1/x)/cos(x) as J(x), so the result is 5J(x) + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the integral result 5J(x), we would get 5J(4). Since we cannot calculate J(x) exactly, let's assume we have a numerical result for J(4) and call it 'result'.\\n\\nThe final step is to round down 'result' to the nearest integer. Let's denote the rounded-down value as 'rounded_result'.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: rounded_result\\n\\nIn a real-world scenario, you would use software or a numerical method to find J(4), then multiply by 5 and round down to the nearest integer to get the final answer.
