Thus, the integral is `5 * (1/2) * sinh(2x) = (5/2) * sinh(2x)`. Evaluating at `x = 0` gives us `(5/2) * sinh(0)`, which is 0 since `sinh(0) = 0`.

Using the identity mentioned earlier, we can integrate to get `5/2 * [sinh(2x+1) - sinh(1)]`. Evaluating at `x = -1` gives us `5/2 * [sinh(-1) - sinh(1)]`. Since `sinh(-1) = -sinh(1)`, the expression simplifies to `5/2 * [-2sinh(1)]`. The value of `sinh(1)` is approximately 1.1752, so the result is `-5 * 1.1752` which is approximately `-5.876`.
