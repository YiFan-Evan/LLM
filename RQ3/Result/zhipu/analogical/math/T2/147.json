Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x)*(1-x).\\n\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x)*(1-x) with respect to x can be found by using the product rule for integration or by integrating each term separately. The integral of sin(x) is -cos(x), and the integral of (1-x) is x - x^2/2. Thus, the indefinite integral is -cos(x) + (x^2)/2 - x^2/2 + C, which simplifies to -cos(x) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x/(1+x).\\n\\n   Solution: The integral of e^x/(1+x) is not straightforward and does not have an elementary antiderivative. However, for the sake of the exercise, let's assume we're looking for a numerical approximation or an antiderivative in terms of special functions. If we were to integrate e^x with respect to x, we would get e^x, but the (1+x) in the denominator complicates matters. This integral would typically require numerical methods or the use of the exponential integral function.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function tan(x)*(1+x^2).\\n\\n   Solution: Integrating tan(x)*(1+x^2) is also not elementary. However, we know that the integral of tan(x) is -ln|cos(x)| + C. The integral of 1+x^2 is x + x^3/3. Thus, the indefinite integral would be the sum of the two, which is -ln|cos(x)| + x + x^3/3 + C.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x)*(1+x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: To integrate cos(x)*(1+x), we can integrate each term separately. The integral of cos(x) is sin(x), and the integral of 1+x with respect to x is x + x^2/2. Thus, the indefinite integral of cos(x)*(1+x) is sin(x) + x^2/2 + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x=4 into the indefinite integral gives us sin(4) + (4^2)/2 + C. Since we're asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we ignore the constant C and the sine term (because sin(4) is not an integer) and only consider the x^2/2 term.\\n\\n(4^2)/2 = 16/2 = 8\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(cos(x)*(1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"\\\"Here are three related problems with their descriptions and solutions:\\n\\n1. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 3*sin(x)*(1-x).\\n\\n   Solution: The integral of 3*sin(x)*(1-x) with respect to x can be found by integrating each term separately. The integral of 3*sin(x) is -3*cos(x), and the integral of (1-x) is x - x^2/2. Thus, the indefinite integral is -3*cos(x) + (3*x)/2 - (3*x^2)/2 + C, which simplifies to -3*cos(x) + (3*x)/2 - (3*x^2)/2 + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 2*e^x/(1+x).\\n\\n   Solution: Similar to the second problem in the initial set, the integral of 2*e^x/(1+x) does not have an elementary antiderivative. However, if we were to consider the integral of 2*e^x, it would be 2*e^x. The (1+x) in the denominator complicates matters, and this integral would typically require numerical methods or the use of the exponential integral function.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 4*tan(x)*(1+x^2).\\n\\n   Solution: Integrating 4*tan(x)*(1+x^2) involves the same approach as the third problem in the initial set. The integral of tan(x) is -ln|cos(x)| + C. The integral of 4*(1+x^2) is 4x + (4*x^3)/3. Thus, the indefinite integral would be -4*ln|cos(x)| + 4x + (4*x^3)/3 + C.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 5*(cos(x)*(1+x)), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: To integrate 5*(cos(x)*(1+x)), we can integrate each term separately. The integral of 5*cos(x) is 5*sin(x), and the integral of 5*(1+x) with respect to x is 5x + 5*x^2/2. Thus, the indefinite integral of 5*(cos(x)*(1+x)) is 5*sin(x) + 5x^2/2 + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x=4 into the indefinite integral gives us 5*sin(4) + 5*(4^2)/2 + C. Since we're asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we ignore the constant C and the sine term (because sin(4) is not an integer) and only consider the 5x^2/2 term.\\n\\n5*(4^2)/2 = 5*16/2 = 5*8 = 40\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 40\\\"\""}]
