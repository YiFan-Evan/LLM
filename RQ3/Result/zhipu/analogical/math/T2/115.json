Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x)/sin(x).\\n   Solution: The function simplifies to f(x) = 1 for all x except when x is an integer multiple of \u03c0. The indefinite integral of 1 is x + C. There is no need to substitute a value for x since the integral is already in a form that doesn't depend on x.\\n\\n2.
