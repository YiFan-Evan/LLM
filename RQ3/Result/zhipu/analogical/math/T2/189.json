Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x*sin(x).\\n   Description: This problem involves the integration of a product of x and the sine function. To solve it, we use integration by parts, where we let u = x and dv = sin(x)dx. Then, we find du = dx and v = -cos(x), and apply the integration by parts formula: \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du.\\n   Solution: \u222bx*sin(x)dx = -x*cos(x) + \u222bcos(x)dx = -x*cos(x) + sin(x) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = (1+x)/sin(x).\\n   Description: This problem requires integrating a rational function involving trigonometric functions. This can be a bit more complex and might involve using trigonometric identities or partial fraction decomposition, depending on the level of complexity we assume for the integral.\\n   Solution: If we assume that the integral can be simplified by using the identity (1+x)/sin(x) = csc(x) + x*csc(x), we can integrate term by term. \u222bcsc(x)dx = -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)| + C and \u222bx*csc(x)dx can be solved using integration by parts. However, the exact solution can be lengthy and depends on the approach used.\\n\\n3. Problem: Evaluate the integral of h(x) = x^2*sin(x).\\n   Description: This problem involves integrating a quadratic function multiplied by the sine function. Similar to the first problem, we would use integration by parts twice because we are dealing with x^2, which would initially give us an x*sin(x) term that we would need to integrate again.\\n   Solution: \u222bx^2*sin(x)dx = -x^2*cos(x) + 2\u222bx*cos(x)dx. Applying integration by parts to the second integral gives us -x^2*cos(x) + 2(-x*sin(x) + \u222bsin(x)dx) = -x^2*cos(x) - 2x*sin(x) - 2*cos(x) + C.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x*(1+x)/sin(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nTo integrate f(x) = x*(1+x)/sin(x), we can split this into two parts: \u222bx/sin(x)dx and \u222bx^2/sin(x)dx. The first part is a bit more complex and might not have a simple elementary antiderivative, but the second part can be approached similarly to problem 3. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we can find an antiderivative or use a numerical method or software to find the antiderivative.\\n\\nAfter finding the antiderivative F(x), we would substitute x=4 into F(x) to get F(4).

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 5*x/sin(x).\\n   Description: This problem involves integrating a linear function multiplied by the trigonometric function sine, with a constant multiplier. The integral of x/sin(x) is not straightforward and does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. However, the constant multiplier can be factored out before integrating.\\n   Solution: Since the integral of x/sin(x) is not elementary, we would typically leave it as an unevaluated integral and simply multiply by the constant. So, \u222b5*x/sin(x)dx = 5\u222bx/sin(x)dx + C, where the integral of 1/sin(x) is commonly written as -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|.\\n\\n2.

This integral would be more complex than the previous two due to the x^2 term and would likely require multiple applications of integration by parts or numerical methods.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 5*(x*(1+x)/sin(x)), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nTo integrate f(x) = 5*(x*(1+x)/sin(x)), we can factor out the constant 5 and integrate the remaining function.
