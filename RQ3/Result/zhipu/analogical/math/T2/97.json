However, it can be computed using integration by parts. Let's denote u = sin(x) and dv = sinh(x)dx. Then, du = cos(x)dx and v = cosh(x).\\n\\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\\n\u222b sin(x)*sinh(x) dx = uv - \u222b v du\\n= sin(x)*cosh(x) - \u222b cosh(x)*cos(x) dx\\n\\nWe need to integrate cosh(x)*cos(x) again by parts. Let u = cos(x) and dv = cosh(x)dx.
