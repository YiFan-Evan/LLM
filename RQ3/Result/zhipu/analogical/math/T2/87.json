Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(ln(x)).\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(ln(x)) with respect to x can be found using a substitution. Let u = ln(x), then du/dx = 1/x and dx = x du. The integral becomes \u222bsin(u) x du = \u222bsin(u) e^u du.

Since we're asked to round down to the nearest integer, we can ignore the constant C as it will not affect the integer part of the result. The value of sin(ln(4)) is approximately 0.5831, and rounding down gives us 0.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(cos(ln(x)))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Here are three related problems with their descriptions and solutions:\\n\\n1.
