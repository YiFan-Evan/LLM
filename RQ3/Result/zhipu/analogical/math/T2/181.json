Let u = 2x, then du/dx = 2, and dx = du/2. The integral becomes \u222b e^u (du/2) = (1/2)\u222b e^u du = (1/2)e^u + C = (1/2)e^(2x) + C.\\n   - **Explanation 1**: The integral of e^(kx) for any constant k is e^(kx)/k + C. In this case, k = 2, so the integral is e^(2x)/2 + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x * e^x.\\n   - **Solution 2**: This integral can be solved using integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^x dx. Then du = dx and v = e^x. Applying integration by parts, we get \u222b x * e^x dx = x * e^x - \u222b e^x dx = x * e^x - e^x + C = (x - 1)e^x + C.\\n   - **Explanation 2**: Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate the product of two functions. It is based on the product rule of differentiation and is particularly useful for functions that are the product of an algebraic function and an exponential or trigonometric function.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = sin(x).\\n   - **Solution 3**: The integral of sin(x) with respect to x is -cos(x) + C. This is a standard integral that can be found in integral tables or through direct application of the chain rule, considering the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x).\\n   - **Explanation 3**: The integral of trigonometric functions such as sin(x) and cos(x) can be directly found using the basic rules of integration, which state that the integral of sin(x) is -cos(x) and the integral of cos(x) is sin(x), each plus the constant C.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nThe function is: f(x) = e^x^2.\\n\\nTo calculate the indefinite integral of f(x) = e^x^2, we need to use a special function called the Gaussian integral, or the error function when dealing with definite integrals.

However, since this function is not elementary and the value of erfi(4) cannot be expressed as a simple integer, the task as stated cannot be completed exactly as requested. In a practical scenario, we would use a calculator to approximate erfi(4), and then round down to get the nearest integer.\\n\\nBut for the sake of providing an integer result, let's assume we have calculated the value and rounded down:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [rounded down integer result of (1/2) * sqrt(\u03c0) * erfi(4)] (Note: This value cannot be determined exactly without a calculator or software that can handle the imaginary error function.)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x^2)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To address the original problem with the function f(x) = 5 * e^x^2, let's first look at three related problems and their solutions:\\n\\n1. **Problem 1**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 5 * e^x.\\n   - **Solution 1**: The integral of 5 * e^x with respect to x is straightforward since e^x is a basic exponential function.

It is related to the Gaussian error function, but for an indefinite integral, it is expressed as \u222b e^(-x^2) dx = (1/2) * sqrt(\u03c0) * erfi(x) + C, where erfi(x) is the imaginary error function.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = e^(2x^2).\\n   - **Solution 3**: Similar to Problem 2, the integral of e^(2x^2) does not have an elementary function form and would involve the imaginary error function, but with a scaling factor due to the 2 in the exponent.
