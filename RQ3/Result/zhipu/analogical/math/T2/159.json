The solution involves finding the antiderivative of `cos(x)`, which is `sin(x) + C`.\\n\\n**Solution 1:**\\nThe indefinite integral of `cos(x)` is `sin(x) + C`. When we substitute `x = 4` into the result, we get `sin(4) + C`. However, since we are not given a value for `C` and it's a constant, it does not affect the calculation when evaluating at a specific point.
