Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^2 * sin(x) / e^x.\\n   Solution: To integrate this, we would use integration by parts twice. The first step would be to let u = x^2 and dv = sin(x)/e^x dx, then we would find v = -cos(x)/e^x. After applying integration by parts, we would need to apply it again to the resulting integral. The final integral would involve trigonometric and exponential functions.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^x * cos(x).\\n   Solution: This is a standard integral that can be solved using integration by parts once. We would let u = cos(x) and dv = e^x dx, then we would find du = -sin(x) dx and v = e^x. After applying integration by parts, we would have an integral that is similar to the original, but with sin(x) instead of cos(x). This can be solved to find the integral of g(x).\\n\\n3. Problem: Compute the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = x^2 * e^x.\\n   Solution: This can be integrated using the method of integration by parts. Let u = x^2 and dv = e^x dx, then we would find du = 2x dx and v = e^x. After applying integration by parts, we would have an expression that involves x, e^x, and a new integral of a simpler form. This new integral can be solved directly.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nWe are given the function f(x) = (cos(x) * x^2) / e^x. To find the indefinite integral of this function, we can use integration by parts. Let's set:\\n\\nu = x^2\\ndu = 2x dx\\ndv = (cos(x) / e^x) dx\\nv = \u222b (cos(x) / e^x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate dv to find v. This can be done by parts as well, with:\\n\\nu = cos(x)\\ndu = -sin(x) dx\\ndv = e^-x dx\\nv = -e^-x\\n\\nHowever, integrating cos(x)/e^x directly is not straightforward and requires another integration by parts, which can get quite complicated. Instead, we can recognize that the derivative of (x^2)/e^x is related to our integrand, which simplifies the process. The derivative of (x^2)/e^x with respect to x is:\\n\\nd/dx [(x^2)/e^x] = (2x*e^x - x^2*e^x)/e^(2x) = (2x - x^2)/e^x\\n\\nThus, the integral of (cos(x) * x^2) / e^x can be found by integrating the derivative of (x^2)/e^x and adjusting for the cosine term. The integral of cos(x) is sin(x), so the integral we are looking for is:\\n\\n\u222b (cos(x) * x^2) / e^x dx = (x^2)/e^x * sin(x) - \u222b (x^2)/e^x * sin(x) dx\\n\\nTo integrate the second term, we would again need to use integration by parts, which would result in an expression involving both sin(x) and cos(x) functions and their respective powers of e^x. However, since we are only interested in the value of the integral at x = 4, we can look for a simpler approach.\\n\\nWe can notice that the integral of cos(x)/e^x dx can be found using the substitution method with u = e^x, leading to du = e^x dx, simplifying the integral to \u222b cos(ln(u)) du, which is \u222b cos(u) du because cos is an even function. The integral of cos(u) is sin(u), and since u = e^x, we have sin(e^x). However, this does not directly help us integrate the x^2 term.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of this integral, it's not straightforward to integrate by hand without additional techniques or software. However, for the sake of this problem, we will proceed under the assumption that the integral simplifies in a manner that allows us to directly evaluate it at x = 4. If we were to actually calculate the integral, we might use software like Mathematica or a table of integrals to find the antiderivative.\\n\\nAssuming we have found the indefinite integral of f(x), we would then evaluate it at x = 4. Since we don't have the actual integral, let's proceed with a hypothetical integral result, I(x), and then evaluate I(4):\\n\\nI(x) = some expression involving x\\nI(4) = some numerical result\\n\\nSince we don't have the actual expression for I(x), we cannot provide the exact numerical result for I(4). However, according to the problem statement, we would round down the result to the nearest integer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The integer result of I(4) after rounding down, which we cannot determine without the actual integral expression.]\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(cos(x)*x^2/e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the original problem with the function f(x) = 5 * (cos(x) * x^2 / e^x), we'll follow a similar approach to the one outlined previously.
