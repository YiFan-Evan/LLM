Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x) * cos(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x) * cos(x) can be found using the trigonometric identity sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x), which implies sin(x)cos(x) = 1/2sin(2x).

However, since cos(x) does not directly relate to the hyperbolic functions in this context, we need to use integration by parts or another suitable method. Here, we use the identity sinh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / 2 and cos(x) as is.\\n\\nLet u = sinh(x) and dv = cos(x)dx. Then, du = cosh(x)dx and v = sin(x).

Let u = cosh(x), then du = sinh(x)dx. The integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222bsin(x)cosh(x)dx = \u222bsin(x)udx\\n                  = \u222businh(x)dx\\n                  = \u222bucosh(x)du (substituting back)\\n                  = \u222bu du\\n                  = 1/2u^2 + C\\n                  = 1/2cosh^2(x) + C\\n\\nSo, the original integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x)dx = sinh(x)sin(x) - 1/2cosh^2(x) + C\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the result:\\n\\nsinh(4)sin(4) - 1/2cosh^2(4) + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to round down to the nearest integer and ignore the constant C, we only need to evaluate the numerical part of the expression at x = 4 and round down:\\n\\nsinh(4)sin(4) - 1/2cosh^2(4)\\n\\nEvaluating this expression numerically and rounding down to the nearest integer gives us the final answer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [After evaluating sinh(4)sin(4) - 1/2cosh^2(4) and rounding down, provide the integer result here.] \\n\\nNote: To provide the exact integer, one would typically use a calculator or computational tool to evaluate the expression at x = 4 and then round down to the nearest integer.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 5*sin(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of 5*sin(x) with respect to x is simply the antiderivative of sin(x) multiplied by the constant 5. The antiderivative of sin(x) is -cos(x). Therefore, the integral is -5cos(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 5*sinh(x)*cosh(x).\\n   Solution: Since sinh(x)*cosh(x) = 1/2*sinh(2x), the integral of 5*sinh(x)*cosh(x) is the integral of 5*(1/2*sinh(2x)), which simplifies to the integral of (5/2)*sinh(2x).

We can use integration by parts or recognize a pattern. Since cos(x) is not directly related to hyperbolic functions, we will use the identity sinh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / 2. However, cos(x) does not simplify in terms of hyperbolic functions, so we proceed with integration by parts:\\n\\nLet u = sinh(x) and dv = 5cos(x)dx. Then, du = cosh(x)dx and v = 5sin(x).

This gives us:\\n\\n\u222b5sin(x)cosh(x)dx = -5cosh(x)sin(x) + \u222b5cos(x)sinh(x)dx\\n\\nNow, we have an integral similar to the original, which suggests that we might end up with a reduction formula or a need to use another method to solve it.
