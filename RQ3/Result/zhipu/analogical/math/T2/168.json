Let u = ln(x) and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = 1/x dx and v = e^x. The integration by parts formula is \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du. Applying this, we get:\\n     \u222bln(x) e^x dx = ln(x) e^x - \u222be^x dx\\n     \u222bln(x) e^x dx = ln(x) e^x - e^x + C\\n     \u222bln(x) e^x dx = e^x (ln(x) - 1) + C\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x * e^x.\\n   - **Solution B**: To integrate g(x) = x * e^x, we again use integration by parts.

Let u = ln(x), then du = 1/x dx. However, this is a bit trickier because we need to express the original function in terms of u. We have h(x) = u / e^u (since e^ln(x) = x), and the integral becomes:\\n     \u222bln(x)/x dx = \u222bu e^-u du\\n     This integral can be solved using integration by parts or by recognizing it as a form of the exponential integral function. For simplicity, we'll assume we integrate directly:\\n     \u222bu e^-u du = -u e^-u - \u222b-e^-u du\\n     \u222bu e^-u du = -u e^-u + e^-u + C\\n     \u222bu e^-u du = -(u+1) e^-u + C\\n     Substituting back, we get:\\n     \u222bln(x)/x dx = -(ln(x) + 1) e^-(ln(x)) + C\\n     \u222bln(x)/x dx = -(ln(x) + 1) / x + C\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function f(x) = ln(x) / e^x:\\n\\nTo integrate f(x) = ln(x) / e^x, we can rewrite the function as f(x) = ln(x) * e^(-x). We would again use integration by parts with u = ln(x) and dv = e^(-x) dx. Then, du = 1/x dx and v = -e^(-x). Using the integration by parts formula, we get:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) e^(-x) dx = -ln(x) e^(-x) - \u222b-e^(-x) dx / x\\n\u222bln(x) e^(-x) dx = -ln(x) e^(-x) + \u222be^(-x) dx / x\\n\u222bln(x) e^(-x) dx = -ln(x) e^(-x) - e^(-x) / x + C\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n-\u222bln(4) e^(-4) dx - e^(-4) / 4 + C\\n-\u222bln(4) e^(-4) dx is a constant with respect to x and does not affect the evaluation at x = 4.
