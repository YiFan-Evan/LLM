However, since we are asked to provide an integer result by rounding down, and knowing that the logarithmic integral grows very slowly, we can estimate that the contribution of the logarithmic integral part will be much smaller than the contribution of the \\\\( \\\\frac{(\\\\ln(x))^2}{2} \\\\) part when evaluated at x=4.\\n\\nEvaluating \\\\( \\\\frac{(\\\\ln(4))^2}{2} \\\\) gives us approximately \\\\( \\\\frac{(\\\\ln(4))^2}{2} \\\\approx \\\\frac{(1.3863)^2}{2} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1.9314}{2} \\\\approx 0.9657 \\\\), which, when rounded down, gives us 0.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0.
