Let u = cos(x), then du = -sin(x)dx, and dx = -du/sin(x). The integral becomes:\\n   \u222b cos(x)*cos(cos(x)) dx = \u222b u * (-du/sin(x)) = -\u222b u du = -u^2/2 + C = -(cos(x))^2/2 + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Find the indefinite integral of the function tan(x)*sec^2(x).  \\n   **Solution B**: The integral of tan(x)*sec^2(x) can be found by recognizing that the derivative of tan(x) is sec^2(x). Therefore, the integral is simply tan(x) + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Compute the indefinite integral of the function e^x * e^e^x.  \\n   **Solution C**: For the function e^x * e^e^x, we can treat e^x as a single variable, say v, so the integral becomes \u222b e^v dv.
