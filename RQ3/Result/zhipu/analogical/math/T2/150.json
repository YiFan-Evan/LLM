This leads to du = e^xdx and v = sin(x). The integral then becomes:\\n     \u222b e^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) - \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx.\\n     Now, we solve for the integral of e^x * sin(x) by again using integration by parts, which will eventually lead to an expression involving e^x * cos(x) and e^x * sin(x).

We can start by taking u = x and dv = e^x * sin(x)dx, then proceed as in the original problem, but with the added complexity of dealing with x in the u term. After applying integration by parts twice (and possibly a third time), we would obtain a rather complex expression involving e^x * sin(x), e^x * cos(x), and x terms. The solution will have more terms than the original integral.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Compute the indefinite integral of e^x * sin(x) - e^x * cos(x).\\n   - **Description:** This problem involves integrating the difference of two functions that are individually the product of an exponential function and trigonometric functions.\\n   - **Solution:** We can solve this by integrating each term separately. The integral of e^x * sin(x) and the integral of -e^x * cos(x) can be found using the same method as in the original problem. The final result would be the sum of these two integrals, which simplifies to:\\n     \u222b (e^x * sin(x) - e^x * cos(x)) dx = e^x * sin(x) + e^x * cos(x) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:** Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x * sin(x), then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution:** The indefinite integral of e^x * sin(x) can be found using integration by parts twice.
