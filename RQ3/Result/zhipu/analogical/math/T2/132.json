Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x) and then find the value of the integral at x = \u03c0/2.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C. Evaluating this at x = \u03c0/2 gives -cos(\u03c0/2) + C = 0 + C, which simplifies to C since cos(\u03c0/2) = 0.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^x and then substitute x = 0 into the result.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C. Substituting x = 0 into this gives e^0 + C = 1 + C.\\n\\n3.

Evaluating this at x = 1 gives (1/3)(1)^3 + C = 1/3 + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function cos(sinh(x)):\\n\\nTo find the indefinite integral of cos(sinh(x)), we can use a substitution method. Let u = sinh(x), then du = cosh(x)dx. However, this substitution doesn't directly help us because we have cos(sinh(x)), not cosh(sinh(x)). We need to use a different substitution. Let's use u = cosh(x), then du = sinh(x)dx. The integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b cos(sinh(x)) dx = \u222b cos(u) du\\n\\nThe integral of cos(u) with respect to u is sin(u) + C.
