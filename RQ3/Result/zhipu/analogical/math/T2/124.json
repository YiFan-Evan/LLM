Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x)^2.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of cos(x)^2 can be found using the trigonometric identity cos(x)^2 = (1/2)(1 + cos(2x)). Integrating this gives us (1/2) * (x/2 + (1/2)sin(2x)) + C = (1/4)x + (1/4)sin(2x) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function tan(x)^2.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of tan(x)^2 can be derived using the identity tan(x)^2 = sin(x)^2/cos(x)^2. The integral of this function is \u222btan(x)^2 dx = \u222bsin(x)^2/cos(x)^2 dx = \u222b(1 - cos(x)^2)/cos(x)^2 dx = \u222bsec(x)^2 dx - \u222bdx = tan(x) - x + C.\\n\\n3.

Substituting x = \u03c0 gives us (1/2)\u03c0 - (1/4)sin(2\u03c0) + C = (1/2)\u03c0 + C.
