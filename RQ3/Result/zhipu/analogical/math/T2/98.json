Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 5*sinh(x)*x.\\n   Solution: The constant multiple can be factored out of the integral. Thus, we can integrate 5*sinh(x)*x by integrating sinh(x)*x and then multiplying the result by 5. Using integration by parts, let u = x and dv = sinh(x)dx. Then, du = dx and v = cosh(x).
