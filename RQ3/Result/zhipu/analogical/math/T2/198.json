Let u = sin(x) and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = cos(x) dx and v = e^x. The integral becomes:\\n\\n   \u222b e^x*sin(x) dx = e^x*sin(x) - \u222b e^x*cos(x) dx.\\n\\n   We need to integrate \u222b e^x*cos(x) dx again using integration by parts, which will lead to the same integral appearing again. This results in an equation that can be solved for the original integral, leading to:\\n\\n   \u222b e^x*sin(x) dx = (e^x*sin(x) - e^x*cos(x))/2 + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function x^2*e^x.\\n\\n   **Solution 2**: This integral requires repeated use of integration by parts. Let u = x^2 and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = 2x dx and v = e^x. Integrating by parts gives:\\n\\n   \u222b x^2*e^x dx = x^2*e^x - \u222b 2x*e^x dx.\\n\\n   Now we need to integrate \u222b 2x*e^x dx, which can be done again by integration by parts, leading to:\\n\\n   \u222b x^2*e^x dx = x^2*e^x - 2x*e^x + 2e^x + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sqrt(1 + x^2).\\n\\n   **Solution 3**: This integral can be approached using a trigonometric substitution. Let x = tan(\u03b8), then dx = sec^2(\u03b8) d\u03b8 and sqrt(1 + x^2) = sec(\u03b8). Substituting these into the integral gives:\\n\\n   \u222b sqrt(1 + x^2) dx = \u222b sec^3(\u03b8) d\u03b8.\\n\\n   This can be solved using integration by parts or by recognizing a reduction formula for integrals involving sec^n(\u03b8). After integration and reverting the substitution, the result is:\\n\\n   \u222b sqrt(1 + x^2) dx = x*sqrt(1 + x^2) - ln|x + sqrt(1 + x^2)| + C.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function ln(cos(x))*e^x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution to the Original Problem**: This integral is more complex and does not have a simple antiderivative. It can be approached using integration by parts, but the resulting expression will likely be complicated and involve special functions or numerical methods for evaluation.
