Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of e^(5x).\\n   Description: This problem involves integrating a function where the variable 'x' is inside the exponent but multiplied by a constant. \\n   Solution: The integral of e^(5x) with respect to x is (1/5)e^(5x) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of e^(-x^2).\\n   Description: This problem is similar to the original but involves the negative square of x in the exponent, which does not have a simple closed-form integral.\\n   Solution: The integral of e^(-x^2) with respect to x is not expressible in terms of elementary functions and is related to the Gaussian integral, which is often represented as \u222be^(-x^2)dx = \u221a\u03c0/2 * erf(x) + C, where erf(x) is the error function.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of e^(x^3).\\n   Description: This problem involves integrating a function with the variable 'x' raised to the third power within the exponent, which is a more complex scenario.\\n   Solution: The integral of e^(x^3) with respect to x does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions.\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem with the function e^x^2:\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of e^x^2 with respect to x cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, we can use numerical methods or software to approximate the integral. For the purpose of this exercise, we'll assume that we have a way to evaluate the integral and then we can proceed to substitute x = 4 into the result.\\n\\nLet's denote the integral of e^x^2 as I(x). So, I(x) = \u222be^x^2 dx.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the integral, we get I(4) = \u222be^(4^2) dx = \u222be^16 dx.\\n\\nThe integral of e^16 with respect to x is simply e^16 times x, since the constant e^16 is not dependent on x. So, I(4) = e^16 * 4.\\n\\nNow, we need to round down the result to the nearest integer. Since e^16 is a very large number, we can use the fact that e is approximately 2.718 to estimate e^16 as (2.718)^16. This calculation is beyond the scope of manual computation, so we would typically use a calculator or computer to find that e^16 is approximately 8886110.4115.\\n\\nMultiplying this by 4 gives us approximately 35544441.6460.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of 5e^x.\\n   Description: This problem involves integrating a function where the base of the exponent is the constant 'e' and the exponent is 'x', multiplied by a constant factor.\\n   Solution: The integral of 5e^x with respect to x is 5e^x + C, because the derivative of e^x is e^x, and the constant factor can be taken out of the integral.\\n\\n2.

This is because we use the substitution method, letting u = 2x, then du/dx = 2, and dx = du/2. The integral becomes (1/2)\u222be^u du, which is (1/2)e^u + C, and substituting back gives us (1/2)e^(2x) + C.\\n\\n3.
