The integral of e^(ax) with respect to x is (1/a)e^(ax) + C, where 'a' is a constant. Applying this rule here, the integral of e^(x+1) is e^(x+1)/1 + C = e^(x+1) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 2e^(2x + 3).\\n   - **Solution**: Here, the function is a multiple of an exponential function, which requires us to use the constant multiple rule of integration. The integral of a constant times a function is the constant times the integral of the function. Thus, the integral of 2e^(2x + 3) is 2 times the integral of e^(2x + 3). Since the integral of e^(ax) is (1/a)e^(ax), the integral of e^(2x + 3) is (1/2)e^(2x + 3) + C. Therefore, the integral of 2e^(2x + 3) is 2 * (1/2)e^(2x + 3) + C = e^(2x + 3) + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Determine the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = 5e^(-x).\\n   - **Solution**: Similar to the first problem, but here we have a negative exponent. The integral of e^(-x) is -e^(-x) + C, because we apply the rule (1/a)e^(ax) + C to a = -1. Multiplying by the constant 5, we get the integral of 5e^(-x) to be 5(-e^(-x)) + C = -5e^(-x) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^(1+x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n- **Solution**: The integral of e^(1+x) is e^(1+x) + C, since the integral of e^(ax) with respect to x is (1/a)e^(ax) + C, and in this case, 'a' is 1. Substituting x = 4 into the integral, we get e^(1+4) = e^5. To provide an integer result by rounding down, we calculate e^5 and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nThe value of e^5 is approximately 148.413.

The integral of e^(x+2) is e^(x+2) + C, since the integral of e^(ax) with respect to x is (1/a)e^(ax) + C, and here 'a' is 1.

The integral of e^(-3x + 4) is (-1/3)e^(-3x + 4) + C, because when 'a' is -3, the integral of e^(ax) is (1/a)e^(ax) + C.
