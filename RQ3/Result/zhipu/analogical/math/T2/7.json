Let u = x^2, then du/dx = 2x, and dx = du/(2x). The integral becomes:\\n     \u222b ln(x^2) dx = \u222b ln(u) (du/(2x))\\n     Since u = x^2, x = \u221au, and dx = du/(2\u221au), the integral simplifies to:\\n     \u222b ln(u) (1/2) du = (1/2) \u222b ln(u) du\\n     The integral of ln(u) is u*ln(u) - u + C. Substituting back, we get:\\n     (1/2) (u*ln(u) - u) + C = (1/2) (x^2*ln(x^2) - x^2) + C\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 1/x.\\n   - **Solution 2**: The integral of 1/x is a basic integral that results in the natural logarithm function.

Substituting x = e into the integral, we get:\\n     e*ln(e) - e + C = e*1 - e + C = e - e + C = C\\n     Since we're evaluating the integral at x = e, the constant C is the only term remaining, and the value of the integral at x = e is C.\\n\\nNow, let's address the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = ln(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution**: The indefinite integral of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x + C.

Thus, ln(x^3) = 3*ln(x). The integral becomes:\\n     \u222b 5*(ln(x^3)) dx = \u222b 5*(3*ln(x)) dx = \u222b 15*ln(x) dx\\n     The integral of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x + C. Therefore, the integral of 15*ln(x) is 15 times the integral of ln(x):\\n     15*(x*ln(x) - x) + C = 15x*ln(x) - 15x + C\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 5/x.\\n   - **Solution 2**: The integral of 5/x is straightforward since the integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C.
