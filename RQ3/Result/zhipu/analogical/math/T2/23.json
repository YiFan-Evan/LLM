The integral of 2x is x^2, and the integral of 2 is 2x. Therefore, the indefinite integral of 2(1+x) is x^2 + 2x + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function (1+x)^2.\\n\\n   **Solution**: To integrate (1+x)^2, we first expand it to 1 + 2x + x^2. The integral of 1 is x, the integral of 2x is x^2, and the integral of x^2 is x^3/3. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1+x)^2 is x + x^2 + x^3/3 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1+x) and then evaluate the result at x=3.\\n\\n   **Solution**: The indefinite integral of (1+x) is simply the integral of 1 plus the integral of x, which is x + x^2/2 + C. When we substitute x=3 into this expression, we get 3 + (3^2)/2 + C = 3 + 9/2 + C = 3 + 4.5 + C. Since we are not given a value for C, we cannot provide a numerical answer, but the expression evaluated at x=3 would be 7.5 + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1+x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution**: The indefinite integral of (1+x) is x + x^2/2 + C. Substituting x=4 into this expression gives us 4 + (4^2)/2 + C = 4 + 16/2 + C = 4 + 8 + C = 12 + C. Since we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, and we are not given a value for C, we ignore C for the purpose of rounding down. The expression simplifies to 12, and rounding down does not change this value.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 12.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Here are three related but not identical problems involving the integration of the function 5*(1+x):\\n\\n1. **Problem 1**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 5(1+x).\\n   \\n   **Solution**: To integrate 5(1+x), we can distribute the 5 to get 5 + 5x. The integral of a constant is the constant times x, so the integral of 5 is 5x. The integral of 5x is (5/2)x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of 5(1+x) is 5x + (5/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function 10(1+x) and then evaluate the result at x=2.\\n   \\n   **Solution**: To integrate 10(1+x), we distribute the 10 to get 10 + 10x. The integral of 10 is 10x, and the integral of 10x is (10/2)x^2, which simplifies to 5x^2. The indefinite integral is 10x + 5x^2 + C. Evaluating this at x=2 gives us 10(2) + 5(2^2) + C = 20 + 20 + C = 40 + C. Since we are not given a value for C, we cannot provide a numerical answer, but the expression evaluated at x=2 would be 40 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 5(1+2x).\\n   \\n   **Solution**: To integrate 5(1+2x), we distribute the 5 to get 5 + 10x. The integral of 5 is 5x, and the integral of 10x is (10/2)x^2, which simplifies to 5x^2.

Substituting x=4 into this expression gives us 5(4) + (5/2)(4^2) + C = 20 + (5/2)(16) + C = 20 + 40 + C = 60 + C.
