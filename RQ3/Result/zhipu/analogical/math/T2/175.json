The integral of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x + C, but because of the (1 + 2e^x) multiplier, you would have to apply integration by parts multiple times, which can be quite involved. The integral would not be a simple expression, but for the sake of this example, let's assume it's computed and simplified to some function F(x) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x * ln(x).\\n   - **Solution 2:** This problem also requires integration by parts. You would treat e^x as the first function and ln(x) as the second function. After applying integration by parts, you would get an expression involving e^x * ln(x), and further integration would be necessary.
