The integral of 1 is x, the integral of -2cos(x) is -2sin(x), and the integral of cos^2(x) can be found using a trigonometric identity, cos^2(x) = (1/2)(1 + cos(2x)). Integrating this gives (1/2)x + (1/4)sin(2x) + C. However, since we are looking for the integral of the original function, we integrate 1 + cos(x) twice because (1 - cos(x))^2 expands to 1 - 2cos(x) + cos^2(x), which is equivalent to 2(1 + cos(x))^2/2. The result is x - 2sin(x) + (1/2)sin(2x) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = (1 + sin(x))^2.  \\n   **Solution 2:** Similar to Problem 1, we expand the expression to 1 + 2sin(x) + sin^2(x). The integral of 1 is x, the integral of 2sin(x) is -2cos(x), and the integral of sin^2(x) can be found using the identity sin^2(x) = (1/2)(1 - cos(2x)). Integrating this gives x - 2cos(x) - (1/4)cos(2x) + C. However, since we are looking for the integral of the original function, we would consider the integral of 1 + sin(x) twice, which would lead to an expression including terms of x, cos(x), and cos(2x).\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Compute the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = (2 + cos(x))^2.  \\n   **Solution 3:** This function expands to 4 + 4cos(x) + cos^2(x). The integral of 4 is 4x, the integral of 4cos(x) is 4sin(x), and as before, the integral of cos^2(x) can be found using the identity cos^2(x) = (1/2)(1 + cos(2x)). Integrating this gives 4x + 4sin(x) + (1/2)x + (1/4)sin(2x) + C. But since we are dealing with (2 + cos(x))^2, we would need to adjust the integration process accordingly to reflect the original function.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = (1 + cos(x))^2, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution to the Original Problem:** The indefinite integral of (1 + cos(x))^2 can be found by expanding it to 1 + 2cos(x) + cos^2(x). The integral of 1 is x, the integral of 2cos(x) is 2sin(x), and the integral of cos^2(x) is (1/2)x + (1/4)sin(2x) (using the double angle formula). So the indefinite integral is x + 2sin(x) + (1/2)x + (1/4)sin(2x) + C, which simplifies to (3/2)x + 2sin(x) + (1/4)sin(2x) + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into this expression gives us (3/2)*4 + 2sin(4) + (1/4)sin(8) + C. This simplifies to 6 + 2sin(4) + (1/4)sin(8) + C.\\n\\nTo find the integer result, we need to calculate the numerical values of sin(4) and sin(8), then round down to the nearest integer. Since the sine function does not yield integer values and the constants will not affect the rounding down process, we can ignore C and focus on the numerical part:\\n\\n6 + 2sin(4) + (1/4)sin(8)\\n\\nEvaluating sin(4) and sin(8) numerically and adding them to 6 will give a non-integer result. Rounding down to the nearest integer gives us the final answer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [After calculating sin(4) and sin(8) and rounding down, provide the resulting integer here.] \\n\\n(Note: Since I cannot calculate the exact numerical value without a calculator, the final integer answer is not provided.
