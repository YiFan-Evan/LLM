Substituting x=4 into this expression gives us (1/2)*cosh(4^2) + C = (1/2)*cosh(16) + C. Since we're only interested in the numerical result and not the constant C, we can ignore it for the purpose of this calculation.\\n\\nTo find cosh(16), we use the definition of cosh in terms of e (the base of the natural logarithm): cosh(x) = (e^x + e^(-x))/2.

Since we're asked for an integer by rounding down, we can use an approximate value for cosh(16) and then apply the rounding.\\n\\nLet's assume cosh(16) is approximately 8.5415 (using a calculator or software for high precision), then (1/2)*cosh(16) is approximately 4.27075.
