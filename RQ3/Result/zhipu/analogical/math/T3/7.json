Let u = x^2, then du/dx = 2x, and dx = du/(2x). The integral becomes:\\n   \u222b ln(x^2) dx = \u222b ln(u) (du/(2x)) = (1/2) \u222b ln(u) du = (1/2) [u ln(u) - u] + C = (1/2) [x^2 ln(x^2) - x^2] + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x * ln(x).  \\n   **Solution 2**: We can use integration by parts for this problem. Let u = ln(x) and dv = x dx. Then du = 1/x dx and v = x^2/2. The integral becomes:\\n   \u222b x * ln(x) dx = u*v - \u222b v*du = (x^2/2) ln(x) - \u222b (x^2/2) (1/x) dx = (x^2/2) ln(x) - (1/2) \u222b x dx = (x^2/2) ln(x) - (x^2/4) + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = 1/ln(x).  \\n   **Solution 3**: The integral of 1/ln(x) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions. However, if we consider the definite integral from 1 to x, it is known as the logarithmic integral function, denoted as Li(x). So, \u222b (1/ln(x)) dx = Li(x) + C, where Li(x) is the logarithmic integral of x.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = ln(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution**: The indefinite integral of ln(x) is given by:\\n\u222b ln(x) dx = x ln(x) - x + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the result gives us:\\n4 ln(4) - 4 + C.\\n\\nSince we're asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we can ignore the constant C as it will not affect the rounding.
