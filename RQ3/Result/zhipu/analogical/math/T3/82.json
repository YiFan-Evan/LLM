Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^3/sin(x).\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of x^3/sin(x) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. This integral would typically require special functions or numerical methods to approximate. Therefore, there is no simple closed-form solution for this integral.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x/sin(x).\\n   Solution: Similar to the previous problem, the integral of x/sin(x) does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = 1/sin(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of 1/sin(x) is known as the integral of the cosecant function, which is -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)| + C. This is a standard integral that can be found in integral tables.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^2/sin(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of x^2/sin(x) does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions, much like the first two problems.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^2/cos(x) + x.\\n   Solution: The integral of x^2/cos(x) does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions and typically requires special functions or numerical methods. However, the integral of x can be found easily, which is x^2/2 + C. Combining these, the indefinite integral of the entire function would be a combination of an expression involving special functions for the first term and x^2/2 for the second term, plus a constant.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x^2/tan(x) + x.\\n   Solution: The integral of x^2/tan(x) is also not expressible in terms of elementary functions. The integral of x, as mentioned before, is straightforward. The indefinite integral of g(x) would be a combination of an expression involving special functions for the first term and x^2/2 for the second term, plus a constant.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = x^2 + x/sin(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of x^2 is x^3/3 + C, and while the integral of x/sin(x) does not have a simple closed-form solution, we can still express the indefinite integral of the entire function as the sum of these two integrals. This would be x^3/3 + an expression involving special functions for the second term, plus a constant.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^2/sin(x) + x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: To find the indefinite integral of f(x) = x^2/sin(x) + x, we would integrate each term separately. As with the previous problems, the integral of x^2/sin(x) does not have a simple closed-form solution and requires special functions or numerical methods. The integral of x is x^2/2 + C.\\n\\nCombining these, the indefinite integral of f(x) is the sum of the integral of x^2/sin(x) (which we'll call I1) and the integral of x (which is x^2/2 + C). Therefore, the integral of f(x) is I1 + x^2/2 + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral, we would have I1(4) + 4^2/2 + C. Since we are interested in the integer result by rounding down, we ignore the constant C because it will not affect the rounding down process.\\n\\nSince I1 cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, we would need to use numerical methods to approximate I1(4). After obtaining this approximation, we would add 8 (which is 4^2/2) and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The result would be an integer obtained by numerically integrating x^2/sin(x) from 0 to 4, adding 8, and then rounding down.] Please use appropriate tools or software to find the numerical result.\""}]
