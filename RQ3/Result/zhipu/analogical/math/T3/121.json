Since we have x^(-2), the integral is (x^(-1))/(-1) = -1/x. Therefore, the indefinite integral of 1/x^2 is -1/x + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of g(x) = 3/x.\\n   - **Solution 2**: Here, we can treat the constant 3 as a coefficient and integrate 1/x as we did before. The integral of 3/x is 3 times the integral of 1/x, which is 3 * ln|x| + C, because the integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Compute the indefinite integral of h(x) = 1/x and then evaluate it at x = e (where e is the base of the natural logarithm).\\n   - **Solution 3**: The integral of h(x) = 1/x is ln|x| + C.

Substituting x = 4 into the integral gives us ln|4| + C = ln(4) + C.

Thus, we can integrate 1/x and 2 separately. The integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C, and the integral of a constant is the constant times x. Therefore, the integral of 1/x + 2 is ln|x| + 2x + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 1/x - x^2.\\n   - **Solution 2**: Similarly, we integrate the two parts of the function separately. The integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C, and the integral of -x^2 is -1/3x^3 + C. Adding these together, we get the integral of 1/x - x^2 as ln|x| - 1/3x^3 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Compute the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = 1/x + x and then evaluate it at x = 1.\\n   - **Solution 3**: The integral of 1/x + x is ln|x| + 1/2x^2 + C. Evaluating this at x = 1 gives us ln|1| + 1/2(1)^2 + C = 0 + 1/2 + C = 1/2 + C.

Substituting x = 4 into the integral gives us ln|4| + 1/2(4)^2 + C = ln(4) + 8 + C. The numerical part of the expression is ln(4) + 8, which is approximately 1.386 + 8 = 9.386.
