Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x)/cos(x) with respect to x.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of sin(x)/cos(x) is \u222bsin(x)/cos(x) dx.

Problem: If f(x) = sin(x)/cos(x), find f'(x), the derivative of f(x) with respect to x.\\n   Solution: The derivative of sin(x)/cos(x) can be found using the quotient rule.

Integrating, we get [-ln|cos(x)|] from 0 to \u03c0/4, which evaluates to -ln|cos(\u03c0/4)| + ln|cos(0)| = -ln(\u221a2/2) + ln(1) = -ln(\u221a2/2) = ln(2/\u221a2) = ln(\u221a2).

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x)/cos(x) + x with respect to x.\\n   Solution: To integrate sin(x)/cos(x) + x, we integrate each term separately. The integral of sin(x)/cos(x) is -ln|cos(x)| + C1, and the integral of x is x\u00b2/2 + C2. Combining these, the indefinite integral of sin(x)/cos(x) + x is -ln|cos(x)| + x\u00b2/2 + C, where C is the sum of the constants of integration C1 and C2.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the derivative of the function f(x) = sin(x)/cos(x) + x with respect to x.\\n   Solution: The derivative of sin(x)/cos(x) is cos(x)/cos(x) - sin(x)sin(x)/cos\u00b2(x), which simplifies to 1 - sin\u00b2(x)/cos(x) or sec(x) - tan(x)sec(x). The derivative of x is 1. Therefore, the derivative of f(x) is sec(x) - tan(x)sec(x) + 1.\\n\\n3. Problem: Evaluate the definite integral from 0 to \u03c0/2 of the function sin(x)/cos(x) + x.\\n   Solution: The definite integral from 0 to \u03c0/2 of sin(x)/cos(x) + x is \u222b[0,\u03c0/2] (sin(x)/cos(x) + x) dx. This is the area under the curve from x=0 to x=\u03c0/2. The integral of sin(x)/cos(x) from 0 to \u03c0/2 is -ln|cos(x)| evaluated from 0 to \u03c0/2, which is -ln(0) + ln(1) = undefined since ln(0) is undefined. However, because cos(x) is positive in the interval (0, \u03c0/2), we can write the integral as -ln(cos(x)) from 0 to \u03c0/2, which evaluates to -ln(0) + 0 = undefined.
