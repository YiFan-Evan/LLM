Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/(1+x))^2.\\n   Solution: To integrate (1/(1+x))^2, we can rewrite it as 1/(1+x)^2. The integral of 1/u^2 with respect to u is -1/u. Therefore, the indefinite integral of 1/(1+x)^2 with respect to x is -1/(1+x) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the definite integral of the function (1/(1+x))^2 from x=0 to x=3.\\n   Solution: We already know the indefinite integral is -1/(1+x) + C. To find the definite integral from x=0 to x=3, we subtract the value of the antiderivative at x=0 from the value at x=3. This gives us [-1/(1+3) + C] - [-1/(1+0) + C] = [-1/4 + C] - [-1 + C] = -1/4 + 1 = 3/4.\\n\\n3. Problem: Evaluate the expression (1/(1+x))*(1/(1+x))^2 at x=2, without integrating.\\n   Solution: Simplifying the expression, we get (1/(1+x))*(1/(1+x))^2 = (1/(1+x))*1/(1+x) = 1/(1+x)^2. Substituting x=2 gives us 1/(1+2)^2 = 1/3^2 = 1/9.

Substituting x=4 into the result of the indefinite integral gives us -1/(1+4) + C = -1/5 + C. To find the integer result, we round down -1/5, which is -0.2, to the nearest integer. Since -0.2 is between -1 and 0, rounding down gives us -1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/(1+x))*(1/(1+x))+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Here are three related problems, each with a description and its solution:\\n\\n1. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/(1+x))^2 + 1.\\n   Solution: We integrate each term separately. The integral of (1/(1+x))^2 is -1/(1+x) + C1. The integral of 1 with respect to x is x + C2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1/(1+x))^2 + 1 is -1/(1+x) + x + C, where C is the sum of the constants C1 and C2.\\n\\n2. Problem: Evaluate the definite integral of the function (1/(1+x))^2 + x from x=0 to x=1.\\n   Solution: Using the indefinite integral from the first problem, we evaluate the antiderivative at x=1 and subtract the value at x=0. This gives us [-1/(1+1) + 1 + C] - [-1/(1+0) + 0 + C] = [-1/2 + 1 + C] - [-1 + C] = 1/2.\\n\\n3.

This equals 1/9 + 18/9 = 19/9.

We already know the integral of (1/(1+x))^2 is -1/(1+x) + C1. The integral of x is (1/2)x^2 + C2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1/(1+x))*(1/(1+x)) + x is -1/(1+x) + (1/2)x^2 + C, where C is the sum of the constants C1 and C2.\\n\\nSubstituting x=4 into the result of the indefinite integral gives us -1/(1+4) + (1/2)(4)^2 + C = -1/5 + 8 + C.
