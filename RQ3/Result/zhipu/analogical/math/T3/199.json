We already know how to integrate \\\\( \\\\sinh(x)^2 \\\\) and \\\\( x \\\\) from the previous problems. However, the integral of \\\\( \\\\sinh(x)^2 \\\\cdot \\\\ln(x) \\\\) is not an elementary function and would require numerical methods to solve.

However, for the sake of this problem, we'll leave it as an antiderivative expression:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Antiderivative of } \\\\sinh(x)^2 \\\\cdot \\\\ln(x) \\\\text{ (let's call it } I(x)) + \\\\frac{1}{2}x^2 \\\\]\\n\\nNow we substitute 'x=4' into the antiderivative expression and the integral of \\\\( x \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ I(4) + \\\\frac{1}{2}(4)^2 \\\\]\\n\\nSince we cannot calculate \\\\( I(4) \\\\) exactly, we would normally use numerical methods to find its value. However, for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume we have calculated \\\\( I(4) \\\\) numerically and obtained a value. Then we would add \\\\( 8 \\\\) (from \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{2}(4)^2 \\\\)) to this value and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nSince I cannot provide the exact value for \\\\( I(4) \\\\), I will express the final step as a hypothetical calculation:\\n\\nLet \\\\( I(4) \\\\) be the numerical result of the integral \\\\( \\\\int \\\\sinh(x)^2 \\\\cdot \\\\ln(x) \\\\, dx \\\\) at \\\\( x = 4 \\\\).
