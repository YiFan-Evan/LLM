Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x * cos(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of e^x * cos(x) can be found using integration by parts twice. Let u = e^x and dv = cos(x)dx. Then, du = e^x dx and v = sin(x). The first integration by parts gives us:\\n   \u222b e^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) - \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx\\n   We need to integrate \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx again, which will be another integration by parts. Let's call it I. Let u = e^x and dv = sin(x)dx. Then, du = e^x dx and v = -cos(x). The second integration by parts gives us:\\n   I = -e^x * cos(x) - \u222b -e^x * cos(x) dx\\n   Simplifying and solving for I, we get:\\n   I = -e^x * cos(x) + \u222b e^x * cos(x) dx\\n   We can now solve for the original integral by substituting I back into the first equation:\\n   \u222b e^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) - (-e^x * cos(x) + \u222b e^x * cos(x) dx)\\n   Solving for the integral on the right side gives us:\\n   \u222b e^x * cos(x) dx = (e^x * sin(x) + e^x * cos(x))/2 + C\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x / cos(x).\\n   Solution: This integral can also be approached using integration by parts. However, due to the presence of the secant function, it's often simpler to use a substitution. Let u = sin(x), then du = cos(x)dx, and the integral becomes:\\n   \u222b e^x / cos(x) dx = \u222b e^x du/u\\n   This is a simple exponential integral, and the result is:\\n   \u222b e^x / cos(x) dx = e^x * ln|u| + C\\n   Substituting back sin(x) for u gives us:\\n   \u222b e^x / cos(x) dx = e^x * ln|sin(x)| + C\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x / tan(x).\\n   Solution: Since tan(x) = sin(x) / cos(x), the integral of e^x / tan(x) can be rewritten as the integral of e^x * cos(x) / sin(x). This can be integrated using substitution. Let u = e^x, then du = e^x dx. The integral becomes:\\n   \u222b e^x * cos(x) / sin(x) dx = \u222b u * du/sin(arcsin(u))\\n   However, this form does not simplify easily. Instead, it's often easier to recognize that this is similar to the derivative of the function -e^x * ln|cos(x)| + C with respect to x. Therefore, the integral can be directly written as:\\n   \u222b e^x / tan(x) dx = -e^x * ln|cos(x)| + C\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function f(x) = e^x / sin(x):\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of e^x / sin(x) does not have a simple closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. However, we can attempt to evaluate it numerically for a specific value of x, like x = 4, using numerical integration methods or software tools. \\n\\nSince we're asked to provide an integer result by rounding down, we would typically use numerical methods to approximate the integral and then round down to the nearest integer. However, as an AI, I don't have the capability to perform real-time numerical integration here, and the integral of e^x / sin(x) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is not possible to provide in this context without the use of numerical methods or software. If you were to use such tools, you would substitute x = 4 into the numerical approximation of the integral and then round down to get the integer result.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x/sin(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Let's consider three related problems with their descriptions and solutions:\\n\\n1.
