Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x) * cosh(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x) * cosh(x) can be found using integration by parts or recognizing the pattern that d/dx [sinh(x)] = cos(x). Thus, the integral is \u222b sin(x) * cosh(x) dx = sinh(x) * sin(x) - \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx. Since \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx is the original integral, we can say the indefinite integral is (1/2) * sinh(x) * sin(x) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = cos(x) * sinh(x) + sin(x) * cosh(x).\\n   Solution: This function is the sum of cos(x) * sinh(x) and sin(x) * cosh(x), which can be integrated separately. We already know the integral of cos(x) * sinh(x) is cos(x) * cosh(x) - sinh(x) + C. The integral of sin(x) * cosh(x) is similar to the first problem, resulting in (1/2) * sinh(x) * sin(x) + C. Adding these gives (1/2) * sinh(x) * sin(x) + cos(x) * cosh(x) - sinh(x) + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Compute the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = exp(x) * cos(x).\\n   Solution: This integral is typically solved using integration by parts twice. Let u = cos(x) and dv = exp(x) dx, then du = -sin(x) dx and v = exp(x). After applying integration by parts once, we get u * v - \u222b v * du, which leads to exp(x) * cos(x) - \u222b exp(x) * (-sin(x)) dx. This results in exp(x) * cos(x) + exp(x) * sin(x) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = cos(x) * sinh(x), then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of f(x) = cos(x) * sinh(x) is cos(x) * cosh(x) - sinh(x) + C. Substituting x = 4 gives us cos(4) * cosh(4) - sinh(4) + C. To get the integer result, we evaluate the expression without the constant C and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\ncos(4) \u2248 -0.6536,\\ncosh(4) \u2248 27.3082,\\nsinh(4) \u2248 27.2899.\\n\\nSo, the expression evaluates to approximately (-0.6536 * 27.3082) - 27.2899. This results in approximately -17.8063 - 27.2899 = -45.0962. Rounding down, we get:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -46.
