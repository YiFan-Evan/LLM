To find the indefinite integral of this function, we integrate each term separately:\\n\\n- The integral of `e^x^2` cannot be done using elementary functions, so we will leave it as an unevaluated integral, denoted as `\u222b e^x^2 dx`.\\n- The integral of `x` is `(1/2)x^2`.\\n\\nSo, the indefinite integral of the entire function is `\u222b e^x^2 dx + (1/2)x^2 + C`.\\n\\nNext, we need to evaluate this integral at `x = 4`. Since we cannot evaluate `\u222b e^x^2 dx` analytically, we would typically use numerical methods to approximate this part of the integral. However, for the sake of this problem, we will treat the integral `\u222b e^x^2 dx` as a constant value `A` that we cannot explicitly calculate.\\n\\nThus, we have `A + (1/2)(4)^2 + C` when we substitute `x = 4`.\\n\\nNow, we do not need to know the exact value of `A` or `C` to complete the problem.
