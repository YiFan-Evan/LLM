Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^2.\\n   Solution: The integral of x^n where n is not equal to -1 is given by (x^(n+1))/(n+1).

For g(x) = 1/x^3, n = -3, so the integral is (x^(-3+1))/(-3+1) = (x^-2)/(-2) = -1/(2x^2).\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = 2/x.\\n   Solution: This is a direct application of the integral of 1/x, which is ln|x| (natural logarithm of the absolute value of x).

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x.\\n   Solution: Using the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n (where n is not -1) is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), the integral of g(x) = x (which is x^1) is (x^(1+1))/(1+1) = (x^2)/2 + C.\\n\\n3.
