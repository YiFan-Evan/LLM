Let u = sin(x)/x and dv = e^(-x)dx. Then, we find du = (cos(x)/x - sin(x)/x^2)dx and v = -e^(-x).

Let u = x and dv = e^(-x)dx. Then, du = dx and v = -e^(-x).

The integral of (1/x) * sin(x) / e^x was addressed in Problem 1, and the integral of x is simply x^2/2 + C. Adding these two results together gives us the indefinite integral of f(x).\\n\\nAfter finding the indefinite integral, we substitute x = 4 into the result. The term x^2/2 evaluates to 4^2/2 = 8 when x = 4. The other term involving the trigonometric and exponential functions will yield a decimal value when x = 4 is substituted.
