The integral becomes \u222b cos(u) du/e^x. Since dx is replaced by du/e^x, the e^x cancels out, leaving us with \u222b cos(u) du, which is sin(u) + C.

The integral becomes \u222b sin(u) du/e^x, which simplifies to \u222b sin(u) du after the substitution. The integral of sin(u) is -cos(u) + C.

Let u = cos(e^x) and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = -sin(e^x) * e^x dx and v = e^x. The integral becomes e^x * cos(e^x) - \u222b e^x * (-sin(e^x) * e^x) dx. This simplifies to e^x * cos(e^x) + \u222b e^x * sin(e^x) * e^x dx. We can further simplify the integral on the right by using the same substitution as before: u = e^x, du = e^x dx. The integral becomes \u222b sin(u) du, which is -cos(u) + C. Substituting back e^x for u, we get -cos(e^x) + C. Therefore, the integral is e^x * cos(e^x) - cos(e^x) + C.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem:\\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(e^x) * sin(e^x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: To integrate cos(e^x) * sin(e^x), we can use the substitution u = e^x, so du = e^x dx and dx = du/e^x.

We can use the double angle formula sin(2u) = 2sin(u)cos(u), so our integral is \u222b (1/2)sin(2u) du, which is -(1/2)cos(2u) + C.
