It often requires integration by parts or numerical methods to approximate the integral.

The integral of sin(sinh(x)) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions, but we can consider it as a function J(x) + C, where J(x) is the antiderivative of sin(sinh(x)) that cannot be simplified further.\\n\\nThe integral of x is straightforward, as mentioned before, and is (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\nSo the indefinite integral of sin(sinh(x)) + x is J(x) + (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this at x = 4. Since we cannot directly compute J(4), we would typically use numerical integration to approximate J(4). Let's denote the numerical approximation of J(4) as N.\\n\\nThe final expression to evaluate at x = 4 is N + (1/2)*4^2.\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we would take the floor of N + 8 (because (1/2)*4^2 = 8).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The integer result after performing the above steps, which is floor(N + 8)].\\n\\nPlease use a numerical integration tool or software to find the precise value of N and then round down to get the final integer result.\""}]
