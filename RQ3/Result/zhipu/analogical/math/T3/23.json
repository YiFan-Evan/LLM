The integral of 1 with respect to x is x, and the integral of x^2 with respect to x is (1/3)x^3. Therefore, the indefinite integral of f(x) is x + (1/3)x^3 + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 2 + 3x.\\n   - **Solution 2:** The integral of a constant is the constant multiplied by the variable of integration, so the integral of 2 with respect to x is 2x. The integral of 3x with respect to x is (3/2)x^2. Hence, the indefinite integral of g(x) is 2x + (3/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Determine the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = x + x^2.\\n   - **Solution 3:** This function can be integrated term by term. The integral of x is (1/2)x^2, and the integral of x^2 is (1/3)x^3.

The integral of 1 with respect to x is x, and the integral of x with respect to x is (1/2)x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral is x + (1/2)x^2 + C. Substituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral gives us 4 + (1/2)(4)^2 + C = 4 + 8 + C = 12 + C.
