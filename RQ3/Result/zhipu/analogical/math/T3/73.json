Since sinh(x) is an odd function, sinh(-x) = -sinh(x), the integral from 0 to 2\u03c0 will be 0 because the function is symmetric about the y-axis within this interval.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Evaluate the definite integral of sinh(x) from -\u03c0 to \u03c0.\\n   - Solution 3: Similar to Problem 2, the integral of sinh(x) from -\u03c0 to \u03c0 will also be 0, as sinh(x) is an odd function and the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval around the origin is zero.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nCalculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x), substitute 'x=4' into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of sinh(x) is (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^(-x) + C.
