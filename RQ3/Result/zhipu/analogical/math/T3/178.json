The integral of cos(2x) / cosh(x) does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, for the sake of the exercise, we can consider the integral of cos(2x) with respect to x, which is (1/2) * sin(2x), and note that the integral of 1/cosh(x) is ln(cosh(x)). Combining these, we would have a complex expression that involves hyperbolic functions and trigonometric functions. Since we are not actually computing the integral here, we'll leave it at this point.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = sin(x) * sin(x) / tanh(x).\\n   - **Solution**: The integral of sin(x) * sin(x) / tanh(x) can be rewritten as sin^2(x) / (sinh(x) / cosh(x)). Simplifying, we get sin^2(x) * cosh(x) / sinh(x). This integral does not have a simple form either, but it involves the hyperbolic functions sinh and cosh, as well as the trigonometric function sin. The integral would likely involve combinations of these functions and possibly inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = tan(x) * tan(x) / sinh(x).\\n   - **Solution**: The integral of tan(x) * tan(x) / sinh(x) can be rewritten as (sin^2(x) / cos^2(x)) / sinh(x). This is another complex integral involving the quotient of trigonometric functions and a hyperbolic function. The integration process would likely result in an expression involving inverse trigonometric and inverse hyperbolic functions, and it would not simplify to a basic form.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x) * sin(x) / sinh(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n- **Solution**: The integral of sin(x) * sin(x) / sinh(x) is not straightforward to calculate and does not have a simple closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions.

The integral of x is simply (1/2) * x^2.

The integral of x remains the same. Let's denote the integral of tan(x) * tan(x) / sinh(x) as H(x).
