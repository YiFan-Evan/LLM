Since these are linearly independent functions, their indefinite integral is the sum of their individual integrals. Therefore, the indefinite integral of f(x) = x + cos(x) is (1/2)x^2 + sin(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the definite integral of the function g(x) = cos(x) + x from 0 to \u03c0.\\n   - **Solution 2**: To find the definite integral, we apply the fundamental theorem of calculus. We evaluate the antiderivative at the upper limit (\u03c0) and subtract the value at the lower limit (0). The antiderivative of g(x) = cos(x) + x is (1/2)x^2 + sin(x) + C. Evaluating this at \u03c0 gives (1/2)\u03c0^2 + sin(\u03c0) - ((1/2)0^2 + sin(0) + C), which simplifies to (1/2)\u03c0^2 + 0 - 0 = (1/2)\u03c0^2.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Determine the average value of the function h(x) = cos(x) + x over the interval from 0 to 2\u03c0.\\n   - **Solution 3**: The average value of a function over an interval [a, b] is given by 1/(b - a) times the definite integral from a to b. From Problem 2, we know the integral from 0 to \u03c0. To find the integral from 0 to 2\u03c0, we double the integral from 0 to \u03c0 because the function is periodic and the interval from \u03c0 to 2\u03c0 will yield the same integral as from 0 to \u03c0. So, the average value is 1/(2\u03c0 - 0) times 2 times (1/2)\u03c0^2, which simplifies to \u03c0^2/(2\u03c0) = \u03c0/2.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = cos(x) + x, substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n- **Solution**: The indefinite integral of f(x) = cos(x) + x is (1/2)x^2 + sin(x) + C. Substituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral gives (1/2)(4^2) + sin(4) + C = 8 + sin(4) + C. Since we're not given a value for C, we can ignore it for the purpose of substitution. sin(4) is approximately -0.7568. Adding this to 8 gives us 8 - 0.7568 \u2248 7.2432.
