As mentioned, the integral of `sinh(x^2)` does not have an elementary form, but we can integrate `x` directly. So, we have:\\n\\n  `\u222b(sinh(x^2) + x) dx = \u222bsinh(x^2) dx + \u222bx dx`\\n\\n  The integral of `x` is `x^2/2 + C`. For the integral of `sinh(x^2)`, we would typically need to use numerical methods or special functions, which we are not doing here. However, for the sake of this problem, let's assume we have found an antiderivative for `sinh(x^2)` and denote it as `F(x)`. Therefore, the indefinite integral would be `F(x) + x^2/2 + C`.\\n\\n  Substituting `x = 4` into the result, we would have `F(4) + 4^2/2 + C`. Since we do not have the explicit form of `F(x)`, we cannot calculate the exact value.
