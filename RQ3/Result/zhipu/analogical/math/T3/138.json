Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x / (1 + e^x).\\n\\n   Solution: To integrate e^x / (1 + e^x), we can use a substitution. Let u = 1 + e^x, then du/dx = e^x, and dx = du/e^x. The integral then becomes:\\n   \\n   \u222b e^x / (1 + e^x) dx = \u222b 1/u du = ln|u| + C = ln|1 + e^x| + C\\n\\n2.

Let u = ln(x), then sinh(x) = sinh(e^u) = (e^u - e^(-u)) / 2, and we need to express dx in terms of du. Since du = 1/x dx, dx = x du = e^u du. The integral then becomes:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) / sinh(x) dx = \u222b u / ((e^u - e^(-u)) / 2) * e^u du\\n\\nThis integral is quite complex and does not have a simple elementary antiderivative.
