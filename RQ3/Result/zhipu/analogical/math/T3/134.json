The key here is to use a substitution. Let u = sin(x), then du = cos(x) dx. The integral becomes \u222b e^u du. Integrating e^u with respect to u gives us e^u + C. Substituting back, we get e^sin(x) + C.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nEvaluate the definite integral of e^sin(x) from 0 to \u03c0.\\n\\n_Solution:_\\nThis is a definite integral, which means we need to find the antiderivative and then evaluate it at the limits of integration. However, because e^sin(x) does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, we typically cannot express this integral in terms of elementary functions. Instead, numerical methods or approximations would be used to find the value of this integral.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nFind the derivative of the function f(x) = e^sin(x).\\n\\n_Solution:_\\nTo find the derivative, we use the chain rule. The derivative of e^sin(x) with respect to x is e^sin(x) * the derivative of sin(x) with respect to x. Since the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x), the derivative of f(x) = e^sin(x) is e^sin(x) * cos(x).\\n\\nNow, let's address the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function e^sin(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n_Solution:_\\nThe indefinite integral of e^sin(x) with respect to x is not expressible in terms of elementary functions. However, we can use numerical methods to approximate the integral. Since we cannot find an exact form, we will skip the step of finding the indefinite integral and go straight to the numerical evaluation.\\n\\nUsing numerical integration techniques or a calculator, we would find the definite integral from a to 4 (where 'a' can be any constant, often taken as 0 for simplicity) and then subtract the value of the integral at 'a' from the value at 'x=4'.

The integral of e^sin(x) is not expressible in terms of a finite combination of elementary functions. However, the integral of x with respect to x is simply (1/2)x^2. Since we cannot integrate e^sin(x) analytically, we would typically leave it as an unevaluated integral along with the integral of x. Thus, the indefinite integral of e^sin(x) + x with respect to x is \u222b e^sin(x) dx + (1/2)x^2 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nEvaluate the definite integral of e^sin(x) + x from 0 to \u03c0.\\n\\n_Solution:_\\nThis problem involves evaluating the definite integral of the function over a specific interval. The integral of x from 0 to \u03c0 is straightforward: (1/2)\u03c0^2. However, the integral of e^sin(x) from 0 to \u03c0 would require numerical methods because it does not have an elementary antiderivative. The sum of these two integrals would give the total area under the curve of the function from 0 to \u03c0.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nFind the derivative of the function f(x) = e^sin(x) + x.\\n\\n_Solution:_\\nTo find the derivative of this function, we use the sum rule for derivatives. The derivative of e^sin(x) with respect to x is e^sin(x) * cos(x) (using the chain rule), and the derivative of x with respect to x is 1.
