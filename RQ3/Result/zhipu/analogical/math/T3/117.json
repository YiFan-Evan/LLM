Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x)*x.\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x)*x does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, but it can be expressed using special functions. The antiderivative is typically written as x*(-cos(x) + sin(x)) + C, where C is the constant of integration. However, this integral cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions without the use of special functions like the sine integral Si(x) and cosine integral Ci(x).\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of x*cos(x^2).\\n   Solution: This integral can be solved using a substitution method. Let u = x^2, then du/dx = 2x, and dx = du/(2x). Substituting into the integral gives us the integral of (1/2)*cos(u) du, which is (1/2)*sin(u) + C. Substituting back for u gives us the final answer: (1/2)*sin(x^2) + C.\\n\\n3.
