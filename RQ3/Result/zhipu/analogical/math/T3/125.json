The integral of each term can be found separately and then combined.\\n   - **Solution**: The indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C, and the integral of x is (1/2)x^2 + C. Adding these gives the indefinite integral of sin(x) + x as -cos(x) + (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of cos(x) - x.\\n   - **Description**: This is similar to the first problem but involves subtraction instead of addition. The approach is the same: integrate each term separately and combine the results.\\n   - **Solution**: The indefinite integral of cos(x) is sin(x) + C, and the integral of -x is -(1/2)x^2 + C. Thus, the indefinite integral of cos(x) - x is sin(x) - (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Compute the indefinite integral of x^2 sin(x).\\n   - **Description**: This problem involves the product of a polynomial and a trigonometric function. This requires integration by parts, a technique used when the integral of a product of two functions is sought.\\n   - **Solution**: Using integration by parts with u = x^2 and dv = sin(x)dx, we find that the indefinite integral of x^2 sin(x) is -x^2 cos(x) + 2x cos(x) - 2 sin(x) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(cos(x)) + x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution**: We can integrate sin(cos(x)) + x term by term. The integral of sin(cos(x)) with respect to x cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, but the integral of x is straightforward. The indefinite integral of sin(cos(x)) + x is:\\n\\n\u222b sin(cos(x)) dx + \u222b x dx = \u222b sin(cos(x)) dx + (1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nThe first term, \u222b sin(cos(x)) dx, does not have an elementary antiderivative, so we cannot express it in closed form. However, we can evaluate the second term:\\n\\n(1/2)x^2 + C = (1/2)(4)^2 + C = 8 + C\\n\\nTo find the value at x = 4, we would add this to the integral of sin(cos(x)) evaluated at x = 4. Since we cannot calculate the exact value of the integral of sin(cos(x)), we would need to use numerical methods to approximate it.\\n\\nAssuming we have approximated the integral of sin(cos(x)) and added it to 8 + C, we would then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\n**Therefore, the final answer is**: The integer result of the numerical approximation of the indefinite integral of sin(cos(x)) + x evaluated at x = 4, rounded down to the nearest integer.
