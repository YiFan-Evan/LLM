The integral of x with respect to x is (1/2)x^2. Substituting x = 4 into the result gives us (1/2)(4)^2 = 8.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = (1/x) * e^x.  \\n   **Solution B**: The function g(x) is the derivative of e^x by the chain rule, so the indefinite integral of g(x) is e^x + C. Substituting x = 4 into the result gives us e^4.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = sin(x)/x.  \\n   **Solution C**: The function h(x) does not have a simple closed-form integral; it's a special function known as the sine integral (Si(x)). However, since we are not required to find an exact expression here, we can't provide a numerical result.

Substituting x = 4 into this result gives us 4 + C. Since C is a constant, we do not need to include it in the final answer. The expression simplifies to just 4.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x/e^x+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Let's consider three related problems, each with a distinct function and the process to follow:\\n\\n1. **Problem A**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = (x^2)/x + 1.\\n   **Solution A**: The function f(x) simplifies to f(x) = x + 1. The indefinite integral of x is (1/2)x^2, and the integral of 1 is x. Thus, the integral of f(x) is (1/2)x^2 + x. Substituting x = 4 into this result gives us (1/2)(4)^2 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = (e^x)/(e^x + 1).\\n   **Solution B**: This function is a bit more complex. The indefinite integral of g(x) can be found using integration techniques such as u-substitution. However, for the sake of this example, let's assume we find the integral to be a complex function involving e^x. Substituting x = 4 into this complex function would give us a specific numerical result.

In this case, u = x/e^x, so we would have to integrate with respect to x while considering e^x as a constant multiplier. However, since we are looking for an indefinite integral, we can ignore the constant multiplier for now and focus on the integral of 1/(1 + x/e^x), which is ln|1 + x/e^x| + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into this result gives us ln|1 + 4/e^4| + C. Since we are only interested in the integer part of the result, we can ignore the constant C and evaluate the natural logarithm expression at x = 4. The value of ln|1 + 4/e^4| will be a positive number less than 1 (because 4/e^4 is a small positive number, and ln(1 + small number) is small). When we round down, the result will be 0.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0\""}]
