Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x) * e^x.\\n   Solution: The integral of cos(x) * e^x can be found using integration by parts. Let u = cos(x) and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = -sin(x) dx and v = e^x. Using the formula for integration by parts (uv - \u222bv du), we get:\\n   \u222b cos(x) * e^x dx = cos(x) * e^x - \u222b -sin(x) * e^x dx.\\n   Now, we apply integration by parts again to the integral on the right side, treating sin(x) as u and e^x as dv. After resolving this, we find the integral to be (e^x * cos(x) + e^x * sin(x))/2 + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of x^2 * ln(x).\\n   Solution: This integral requires a technique called integration by parts twice. Let u = ln(x) and dv = x^2 dx. Then, du = 1/x dx and v = x^3/3. Using integration by parts, we get:\\n   \u222b x^2 * ln(x) dx = ln(x) * x^3/3 - \u222b x^3/3 * (1/x) dx.\\n   Simplifying, we get:\\n   \u222b x^2 * ln(x) dx = x^3/3 * ln(x) - \u222b x^2/3 dx.\\n   Now, integrate x^2/3 to get x^3/9 + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Compute the indefinite integral of sqrt(1 - x^2).\\n   Solution: This is a standard form that can be integrated using a trigonometric substitution. Let x = sin(\u03b8), then dx = cos(\u03b8) d\u03b8, and sqrt(1 - x^2) = sqrt(1 - sin^2(\u03b8)) = cos(\u03b8). Substituting, we get:\\n   \u222b sqrt(1 - x^2) dx = \u222b cos(\u03b8) * cos(\u03b8) d\u03b8 = \u222b cos^2(\u03b8) d\u03b8.\\n   Using the identity cos^2(\u03b8) = (1 + cos(2\u03b8))/2, the integral becomes:\\n   \u222b (1 + cos(2\u03b8))/2 d\u03b8 = \u03b8/2 + (sin(2\u03b8))/4 + C.\\n   Since x = sin(\u03b8), we can express \u03b8 in terms of x using arcsin(x), and the integral simplifies to (arcsin(x) + x * sqrt(1 - x^2))/2 + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x) * sin(x), then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of sinh(x) * sin(x) can be found using the product-to-sum identity for hyperbolic and trigonometric functions. The identity sinh(x) * sin(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/2 * sin(x) does not simplify the integral directly, so we can use integration by parts. Let u = sinh(x) and dv = sin(x) dx. Then, du = cosh(x) dx and v = -cos(x). Using integration by parts, we get:\\n\u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx = -sinh(x) * cos(x) - \u222b -cos(x) * cosh(x) dx.\\nNow, let's integrate the second term again using integration by parts, with u = cos(x) and dv = cosh(x) dx. Then, du = -sin(x) dx and v = sinh(x). After integrating, we will have an expression that we can simplify and evaluate at x = 4.\\n\\nLet's perform the integration:\\n\u222b cos(x) * cosh(x) dx = cos(x) * sinh(x) - \u222b sinh(x) * (-sin(x)) dx\\n\u222b cos(x) * cosh(x) dx = cos(x) * sinh(x) + \u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx\\n\\nNow, substitute this back into our original integral:\\n\u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx = -sinh(x) * cos(x) - (cos(x) * sinh(x) + \u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx)\\n2 * \u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx = -sinh(x) * cos(x) - cos(x) * sinh(x)\\n\u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx = -sinh(x) * cos(x)/2 - C\\n\\nNow, we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\\n- sinh(4) * cos(4)/2\\n\\nEvaluating this expression with a calculator and rounding down to the nearest integer, we get the final answer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [rounded down integer value of - sinh(4) * cos(4)/2 when x = 4]\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sinh(x)*sin(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Let's follow the same structure as before, providing three related problems with descriptions and solutions, and then solving the original problem.\\n\\n1. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x) * cos(x).\\n   Solution: To integrate sinh(x) * cos(x), we can use integration by parts. Let u = sinh(x) and dv = cos(x) dx. Then, du = cosh(x) dx and v = sin(x). Using the integration by parts formula (uv - \u222bv du), we get:\\n   \u222b sinh(x) * cos(x) dx = sinh(x) * sin(x) - \u222b sin(x) * cosh(x) dx. The integral on the right side can be simplified using the identity cosh(x) = (e^x + e^(-x))/2, leading to a more complex integral that would require another application of integration by parts or a trigonometric substitution.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of x * e^x.\\n   Solution: This integral is straightforward and can be solved using integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = dx and v = e^x. Applying integration by parts gives:\\n   \u222b x * e^x dx = x * e^x - \u222b e^x dx = x * e^x - e^x + C = (x - 1)e^x + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Compute the indefinite integral of tan(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of tan(x) is \u222b sin(x)/cos(x) dx. This can be rewritten as \u222b sin(x) d(cos(x))/cos(x) and then integrated using the substitution u = cos(x), du = -sin(x) dx. The integral becomes -\u222b 1/u du, which is -ln|u| + C, or -ln|cos(x)| + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x) * sin(x) + x, then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: We can integrate the function sinh(x) * sin(x) + x by parts. The integral of sinh(x) * sin(x) was discussed in the related problems, and we can integrate x directly. The indefinite integral of the sum is the sum of the indefinite integrals of each term:\\n\\n\u222b (sinh(x) * sin(x) + x) dx = \u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx + \u222b x dx\\n\\nWe already know from the related problems that \u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx is not a simple integral, but we can integrate x directly, which gives us (x^2)/2 + C. Combining these results, we have:\\n\\n\u222b (sinh(x) * sin(x) + x) dx = \u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx + (x^2)/2 + C\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this at x = 4. The first term is the integral of sinh(x) * sin(x), which we can denote as I(sinh(x) * sin(x)). The second term is straightforward:\\n\\n(4^2)/2 = 16/2 = 8\\n\\nSo we have:\\n\\nI(sinh(x) * sin(x)) + 8\\n\\nWe need to evaluate I(sinh(x) * sin(x)) at x = 4. Since the integral of sinh(x) * sin(x) does not have a simple closed-form solution, we would typically use numerical methods to approximate this value. However, for the sake of this problem, let's assume we have found the value of I(sinh(x) * sin(x)) at x = 4 to be some number A. Then our expression becomes A + 8.\\n\\nFinally, we round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\nfloor(A + 8)\\n\\nSince we do not have the exact value of A, we cannot provide an exact number. However, if you have the exact value of the integral of sinh(x) * sin(x) at x = 4, you would substitute it for A, add 8, and round down to get the final integer answer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [rounded down integer value of A + 8, where A is the value of the integral of sinh(x) * sin(x) at x = 4].\""}]
