It is known as the sine integral, denoted as Si(x). Therefore, the indefinite integral is \u222b sin(x)/x dx = Si(x) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x/(1/x).\\n   - **Solution 2:** To integrate e^x/(1/x), we use substitution. Let u = 1/x, then du = -1/x^2 dx, or dx = -x^2 du. Substituting this into the integral gives us \u222b e^x/(1/x) dx = \u222b e^x * x^2 du, which simplifies to \u222b e^x * x^2 du. However, this integral is not straightforward and does not result in a simple expression. It would require a more complex substitution or integration by parts, and the result would not be an elementary function.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x)/x^2.\\n   - **Solution 3:** The integral of cos(x)/x^2 is also not expressible in terms of elementary functions.

Let u = cos(x) and dv = x dx. Then du = -sin(x) dx and v = x^2/2. Applying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x) * x dx = uv - \u222b v du\\n                  = (cos(x) * x^2/2) - \u222b (x^2/2) * (-sin(x)) dx\\n                  = (cos(x) * x^2/2) + \u222b (x^2/2) * sin(x) dx\\n\\nThe second integral also requires integration by parts, which can be quite lengthy and involves multiple steps. However, we can simplify the process by noting that we only need to evaluate this at x = 4, so we can look for an antiderivative that's easier to evaluate.\\n\\nAfter integrating cos(x)/x, we get:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x)/(1/x) dx = sin(x) * x - \u222b sin(x) dx\\n                   = sin(x) * x + cos(x) + C\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the result, we have:\\n\\nsin(4) * 4 + cos(4) + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to round down to the nearest integer, we can ignore the constant C (as it does not affect the rounding) and evaluate the expression at x = 4:\\n\\nsin(4) * 4 + cos(4)\\n\\nUsing a calculator, we can find the numerical values of sin(4) and cos(4), and then calculate the expression.
