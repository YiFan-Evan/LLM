Let u = 1 + x^3. Then du/dx = 3x^2, so dx = du / (3x^2). Substituting x^2 with (u - 1) / x^2 and dx with du / (3x^2), we get:\\n     \u222b (x^2 / (1 + x^3)) dx = \u222b ((u - 1) / x^2) / u * (du / (3x^2)) = (1/3) \u222b (1/u - 1/x^2) du. The integral of 1/u is ln|u|, and the integral of 1/x^2 is -1/x. Substituting back for u, we get:\\n     (1/3) (ln|1 + x^3| + 1/x) + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Compute the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = sqrt(1 - x^2).\\n   - **Solution 3**: The integral of h(x) = sqrt(1 - x^2) is a standard form that results in an inverse trigonometric function.

We can use integration by parts with u = sinh(x) and dv = x dx. Then du = cosh(x) dx and v = x^2/2. Applying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222b x*sinh(x) dx = u*v - \u222b v*du = (x^2/2)*sinh(x) - \u222b (x^2/2)*cosh(x) dx.\\n\\nNow, we need to integrate x^2/2 * cosh(x) again using integration by parts, which can be a bit lengthy.

The integral of sinh(x)/x is not expressible in terms of elementary functions, but it is related to the hyperbolic sine integral Si(x).
