However, in this case, the integral can be found by recognizing that it's the derivative of the natural logarithm of (x + 1) minus the derivative of x. The integral is therefore ln|x + 1| - x + C. Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives us ln|4 + 1| - 4 + C = ln(5) - 4 + C. Since we are asked to exclude the constant C and provide only the integer part by rounding down, we consider only ln(5) - 4. The value of ln(5) is approximately 1.609, so ln(5) - 4 is approximately -2.391. Rounding down, we get -3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -3\""}]
