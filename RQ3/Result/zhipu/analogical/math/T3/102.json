The indefinite integral of 1 with respect to x is x + C. When we substitute x = 5 into the integral, we get 5 + C. Since we are not given no value for C, we can't determine the exact numerical result, but the integer part without C is 5.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = (x + 2)^2/(x + 2)^2 and evaluate the integral at x = -1.\\n\\n   **Solution 2:** The function simplifies to g(x) = 1 for all x \u2260 -2 (since division by zero is undefined).

The expression x^2/(x^2 + x) can be simplified by factoring out an x from the denominator, but we must be careful because division by zero is undefined. The expression simplifies to x/(x + 1) for all x \u2260 -1 and x \u2260 0.\\n\\nHere are three related problems with their descriptions and solutions:\\n\\n1. **Problem 1:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x/(x + 1) and then evaluate the integral at x = 1, assuming the function is defined at that point.\\n\\n   **Solution 1:** The indefinite integral of f(x) = x/(x + 1) can be found using a simple substitution or by recognizing it as a basic logarithmic derivative. The integral is \u222bx/(x + 1) dx = \u222b(x + 1 - 1)/(x + 1) dx = \u222b(1 - 1/(x + 1)) dx = x - ln|x + 1| + C. When we substitute x = 1 into the integral, we get 1 - ln|1 + 1| + C = 1 - ln(2) + C. Since we are not given a value for C, we can't determine the exact numerical result, but we will ignore C for the purpose of finding the integer part.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x/(x + 2) and evaluate the integral at x = -2, which is a point where the function is undefined.\\n\\n   **Solution 2:** The function g(x) = x/(x + 2) has a vertical asymptote at x = -2, and thus it is not defined there. This problem would not have a meaningful solution because the function's value is not defined at the point of evaluation.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Determine the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = (x^2)/(x^2 + 2x) and evaluate the integral at x = 3.\\n\\n   **Solution 3:** The function h(x) can be simplified by factoring out an x from the denominator, resulting in h(x) = x/(x + 2). The integral of h(x) is the same as in Problem 1: x - ln|x + 2| + C. Substituting x = 3 gives us 3 - ln|3 + 2| + C = 3 - ln(5) + C. Again, ignoring C, the integer part without C is 3.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^2/(x^2 + x), then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution to the Original Problem:** As previously mentioned, the function simplifies to f(x) = x/(x + 1) for all x \u2260 -1 and x \u2260 0. The indefinite integral of f(x) is x - ln|x + 1| + C. When we substitute x = 4 into the integral, we get 4 - ln|4 + 1| + C = 4 - ln(5) + C. Ignoring C, we are left with 4 - ln(5), which is approximately 4 - 1.609 = 2.391. Rounding down, the integer result is 2.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2\""}]
