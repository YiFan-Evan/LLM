So, the integral of f(x) is e^x + 2x. When you substitute 'x=0' into the result (as we don't have a specific value to substitute, we choose a simple one for demonstration), you get e^0 + 2*0 = 1 + 0 = 1. Since the problem asks for rounding down and we already have an integer, the result remains 1.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 3e^x.  \\n   **Solution**: The integral of e^x is e^x, and when we have a coefficient in front of e^x, we just multiply the result by that coefficient. So, the integral of g(x) is 3e^x. Substituting 'x=1' into the result gives 3e^1 = 3e \u2248 8.22. Rounding down, the result is 8.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = e^x - e^2.  \\n   **Solution**: The integral of e^x is e^x, and the integral of a constant is the constant times x. However, since e^2 is a constant, we treat it as such, and its integral with respect to x is just e^2 times x. The integral of h(x) is therefore e^x - e^2x. Substituting 'x=2' into the result gives e^2 - 2e^2 = e^2(1 - 2) = -e^2. Since the result is negative and we need to round down, the integer part is -7 (because e^2 \u2248 7.39).\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution**: The indefinite integral of e^x is simply e^x (+C, but we exclude the constant for this problem). Substituting 'x=4' into the result gives e^4 \u2248 54.598. Rounding down, the integer result is 54.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 54\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Here are three related problems with their descriptions and solutions:\\n\\n1. **Problem 1**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x + 1.\\n   **Solution**: The integral of e^x is e^x, and the integral of a constant (like 1) is that constant times x. So, the integral of f(x) is e^x + x. There's no specific 'x' value to substitute in this problem statement, but if we were to choose 'x=0' for demonstration, we would get e^0 + 0 = 1 + 0 = 1. Since the result is already an integer, no rounding is necessary.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^x + x^2.\\n   **Solution**: The integral of e^x is e^x, and the integral of x^2 is (1/3)x^3. So, the integral of g(x) is e^x + (1/3)x^3. Substituting 'x=1' into the result gives e^1 + (1/3)(1)^3 = e + (1/3) \u2248 2.718 + 0.333 = 3.051.
