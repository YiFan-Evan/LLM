When we substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral, we get e^4 + C. Since we're not given a value for C and it will cancel out when we round down, we only need to consider e^4.

The integral of e^x is e^x, and the integral of x is (1/2)x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of e^x + x is e^x + (1/2)x^2 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Evaluate the definite integral of e^x + x from 0 to 1.\\n   - Solution: Using the antiderivative from Problem 1, we evaluate it at the limits of integration 0 and 1. This gives us [e^x + (1/2)x^2] from 0 to 1, which is (e^1 + (1/2)(1)^2) - (e^0 + (1/2)(0)^2).

The area under the curve is the definite integral of e^x + x from -1 to 2. Using the antiderivative from Problem 1 and evaluating it at the limits -1 and 2 gives us [e^x + (1/2)x^2] from -1 to 2.

Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives us e^4 + (1/2)(4)^2 + C, which simplifies to e^4 + 8 + C. Since C is a constant, it will not affect the rounding down process. The value of e^4 is approximately 54.598, and (1/2)(4)^2 is 8. Adding these gives us 54.598 + 8 \u2248 62.598.
