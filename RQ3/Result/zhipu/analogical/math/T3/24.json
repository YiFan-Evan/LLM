Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 2e^x.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C. When we multiply the function by a constant, the integral also gets multiplied by that constant. Therefore, the integral of 2e^x is 2e^x + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^(-x).\\n   Solution: The integral of e^(-x) can be found by using substitution or recognizing that the derivative of -e^(-x) is e^(-x). Thus, the indefinite integral of e^(-x) is -e^(-x) + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Compute the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = x * e^x.\\n   Solution: This integral requires integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = dx and v = e^x. Using the formula for integration by parts, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get \u222bx e^x dx = x e^x - \u222be^x dx = x e^x - e^x + C = e^x(x - 1) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C. Substituting x = 4 into the integral gives us e^4 + C.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x + 2.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of a sum of functions is the sum of the indefinite integrals of each function. Therefore, the integral of e^x is e^x + C, and the integral of a constant (in this case, 2) is the constant times x, which is 2x + C. Thus, the integral of e^x + 2 is e^x + 2x + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x + e^x.\\n   Solution: Similar to the first problem, the integral of x is (1/2)x^2 + C, and the integral of e^x remains e^x + C. Adding these together gives us the indefinite integral of x + e^x as (1/2)x^2 + e^x + C.\\n\\n3.

Substituting x = 4 into the integral gives us e^4 + (1/2)(4)^2 + C. Since we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down and C is a constant that does not affect the rounding, we can ignore it for the purpose of rounding. e^4 is approximately 54.598, and (1/2)(4)^2 is 8.
