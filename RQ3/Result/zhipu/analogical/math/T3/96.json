Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x^2).\\n   Description: This problem involves finding the antiderivative of a trigonometric function composed with a quadratic function.\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x^2) does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, it can be expressed in terms of the Fresnel integral, which is a special function, denoted as Si(x) for the integral of sin(x^2). Thus, the indefinite integral is \u222bsin(x^2)dx = Si(x^2) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of x * cos(x).\\n   Description: This problem requires the use of integration by parts, a technique for integrating products of functions.\\n   Solution: Using integration by parts with u = x and dv = cos(x)dx, we get du = dx and v = sin(x). The integral becomes \u222bx * cos(x)dx = x * sin(x) - \u222bsin(x)dx. Integrating sin(x) gives -cos(x), so the result is x * sin(x) + cos(x) + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x * cos(x).\\n   Description: This problem also requires integration by parts, and because the integrand is a product of an exponential and a trigonometric function, the process needs to be repeated.\\n   Solution: Using integration by parts twice with u = e^x and dv = cos(x)dx, we get du = e^xdx and v = sin(x). The first iteration gives \u222be^x * cos(x)dx = e^x * sin(x) - \u222be^x * sin(x)dx. For the second iteration, we again use integration by parts with the same u and dv, resulting in \u222be^x * sin(x)dx = e^x * sin(x) - e^x * cos(x) + \u222be^x * cos(x)dx. Solving for the original integral, we get \u222be^x * cos(x)dx = (e^x * sin(x) + e^x * cos(x))/2 + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x^2), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of cos(x^2) also does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. Similar to sin(x^2), it can be expressed in terms of the Fresnel integral, this time denoted as Ci(x) for the integral of cos(x^2). Thus, the indefinite integral is \u222bcos(x^2)dx = Ci(x^2) + C.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x^2) + x.\\n   Description: This problem involves integrating a sum of a trigonometric function composed with a quadratic and a linear function.\\n   Solution: The integral can be computed by integrating each term separately. The integral of sin(x^2) does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions, but the integral of x is straightforward.
