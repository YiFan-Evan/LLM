The integral of cosh(x) with respect to x is sinh(x). However, since the function is the product of sinh((1+x)) and cosh(x), we must use integration by parts. Let u = sinh((1+x)) and dv = cosh(x) dx.

Since the integral of sinh(x) is cosh(x), and the integral of cosh(x) is sinh(x), we can start by writing:\\n\\n\u222b sinh((1+x))*sinh(x) dx = \u222b sinh(x) * sinh((1+x)) dx\\n\\nLet's use substitution: let u = 1+x, so du = dx, and the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b sinh(u)*sinh(u-1) du\\n\\nThis is a bit trickier because we now have two sinh functions with different arguments. However, we can simplify the process by recognizing that the derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x), so we can integrate each sinh term separately. This results in:\\n\\n\u222b sinh(u)*sinh(u-1) du = (1/2)[sinh^2(u) - sinh^2(u-1)] + C\\n\\nNow, substitute back u = 1+x:\\n\\n(1/2)[sinh^2(1+x) - sinh^2(x)] + C\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this expression at x = 4:\\n\\n(1/2)[sinh^2(5) - sinh^2(4)] \\n\\nSince sinh(x) is an increasing function, sinh(5) > sinh(4), and the value of the expression will be positive. However, to find the exact integer result by rounding down, we would need the actual numerical values of sinh(5) and sinh(4), which are not simple to calculate by hand without a calculator.
