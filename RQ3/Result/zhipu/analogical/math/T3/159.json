Let u = sin(x), then du = cos(x)dx. However, since the integral of sinh(u) with respect to u is cosh(u) + C, and we have sinh(sin(x)), the substitution is not straightforward and the integral of sinh(sin(x)) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. We would typically leave it as an integral of sinh(sin(x)).\\n\\nFor the second term, the integral is straightforward:\\n\\n\u222b x dx = (1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nCombining these, we get:\\n\\n\u222b sinh(sin(x)) dx + \u222b x dx = \u222b sinh(sin(x)) dx + (1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the result, excluding the constant C since we are only interested in the integer part:\\n\\nsinh(sin(4)) + (1/2)(4)^2\\n\\nWe don't need to calculate the exact value of sinh(sin(4)), as we are only interested in the integer part after rounding down. The term (1/2)(4)^2 is 8. Since sinh(sin(4)) is a transcendental function that will yield a decimal when calculated, we only consider the 8 for rounding purposes. Therefore, the final answer, after rounding down, is:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8\""}]
