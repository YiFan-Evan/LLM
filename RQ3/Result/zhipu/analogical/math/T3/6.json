The integral of x with respect to x is (1/2)x^2. When we substitute x = 3 into the result, we get (1/2)(3)^2 = (1/2)(9) = 4.5.

The integral of 1 with respect to x is x, and the integral of x with respect to x is (1/2)x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of f(x) is x + (1/2)x^2.

The integral of a constant is the constant times x, so the integral of 2 is 2x. The integral of x remains the same as before, (1/2)x^2. Thus, the indefinite integral of g(x) is 2x + (1/2)x^2.
