The indefinite integral of e^x is simply e^x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nFind the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^(2/x).\\n\\nSolution 2:\\nTo integrate g(x) = e^(2/x), we use a substitution. Let u = 2/x, then du/dx = -2/x^2, and dx = -x^2/2 du. The integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b e^(2/x) dx = \u222b e^u (-x^2/2) du\\n\\nThis integral is not straightforward, but it can be managed with careful substitution and integration by parts or by recognizing it as a special function (if we're not looking for a simple closed-form solution).\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = e^(-1/x).\\n\\nSolution 3:\\nFor h(x) = e^(-1/x), we can use a substitution as well.

We can use a substitution to solve this. Let u = 1/x, then du/dx = -1/x^2, and dx = -x^2 du. The integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b e^(1/x) dx = \u222b e^u (-x^2) du\\n\\nThis is a transcendental integral that does not have a simple elementary function form. However, we can integrate it by recognizing that it is related to the exponential integral function, Ei(x), which is defined as:\\n\\nEi(x) = -\u222b (-\u221e to x) e^t / t dt\\n\\nSo, our integral can be related to Ei(1/x) with a negative sign and a factor of x^2. However, since we are only interested in the value at x=4, we can use numerical methods to approximate the integral at this point without finding a closed-form expression.\\n\\nUsing numerical integration or a calculator, we can find the value of the integral at x=4 and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nAfter performing the calculation numerically, suppose we find that the value of the integral at x=4 is approximately 4.24. Rounding down, we get:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4\\n\\n(Note: The actual calculation of the integral at x=4 would typically require numerical methods or a computer algebra system, and the exact value provided here is for illustrative purposes only.)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^(1/x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Let's consider three related problems involving integration:\\n\\n**Problem 1:**\\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x.\\n\\n**Solution 1:**\\nThe integral of x with respect to x is a basic integral in calculus.
