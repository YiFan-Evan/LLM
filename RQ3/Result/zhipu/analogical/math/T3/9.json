Evaluating this at x = 2 gives us sinh(2) + C. Since we're not given a specific value for C, we can't calculate an exact numerical value, but we have the expression sinh(2) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Determine the indefinite integral of g(x) = sinh(2x), and then substitute x = 1 into the resulting expression.\\n\\n   **Solution 2**: The integral of sinh(2x) with respect to x is (1/2) * cosh(2x) + C. Substituting x = 1 into this gives us (1/2) * cosh(2) + C. Again, without the specific value of C, we can't provide a numerical result, but the expression is (1/2) * cosh(2) + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Find the indefinite integral of h(x) = x * sinh(x) and evaluate the integral at x = e, where e is the base of the natural logarithm.\\n\\n   **Solution 3**: This integral is more complex and requires integration by parts. If we let u = x and dv = sinh(x)dx, then we get du = dx and v = cosh(x). Using the integration by parts formula, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we have \u222bx * sinh(x)dx = x * cosh(x) - \u222bcosh(x)dx. The integral of cosh(x) is sinh(x), so we have x * cosh(x) - sinh(x) + C. Evaluating this at x = e gives us e * cosh(e) - sinh(e) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sinh(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution to the Original Problem**: The indefinite integral of sinh(x) is cosh(x) + C. Substituting x = 4 gives us cosh(4) + C. To provide the integer result by rounding down, we would need to know the numerical value of cosh(4) and C. However, since we are asked to ignore the constant C and only consider the function's evaluation at x = 4, we calculate cosh(4) and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nUsing a calculator or software, we find that cosh(4) is approximately 27.30823.

Substituting x = -1 into this expression gives us cosh(-1) + (-1)^2 + C = cosh(-1) + 1 + C. The hyperbolic cosine of -1 is the same as the hyperbolic cosine of 1, so we have cosh(1) + 1 + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sinh(x) + x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution to the Original Problem**: The indefinite integral of sinh(x) + x is cosh(x) + (x^2/2) + C.
