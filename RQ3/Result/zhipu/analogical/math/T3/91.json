Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1 - x)/sinh(x).\\n   Solution: To integrate (1 - x)/sinh(x), we would separate the integral into two parts: \u222b1/sinh(x) dx and \u222b-x/sinh(x) dx. The first part can be integrated using the identity \u222b1/sinh(x) dx = ln(sinh(x) + cosh(x)) + C1. For the second part, we would use integration by parts or recognize it as a derivative of -ln(sinh(x) + cosh(x)), which simplifies the integration. The final result would be ln(sinh(x) + cosh(x)) - x*ln(sinh(x) + cosh(x)) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function x^2/sinh(x).\\n   Solution: This integral is more complex and may not have a simple closed-form solution. We would likely need to use integration by parts multiple times or numerical methods to approximate the integral. The solution would not be a simple expression and might require the use of special functions or software to find an antiderivative.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x/sinh(x).\\n   Solution: This integral can be approached by recognizing that e^x/sinh(x) = e^x(cosh(x)/sinh(x)) = e^x(cosh(x)/e^x) = cosh(x)/e^(-x). We can then integrate cosh(x)/e^(-x) by making a substitution u = e^(-x), leading to the integral \u222bu/(1 - u^2) du, which can be solved using partial fractions. The result, after reversing the substitution, would involve hyperbolic functions and a constant of integration.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1 + x)/sinh(x), then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution:\\nThe indefinite integral of (1 + x)/sinh(x) can be approached similarly to the first related problem. We can split it into two parts: \u222b1/sinh(x) dx and \u222bx/sinh(x) dx. The first part is \u222b1/sinh(x) dx = ln(sinh(x) + cosh(x)) + C1. For the second part, \u222bx/sinh(x) dx, we can use integration by parts with u = x and dv = 1/sinh(x) dx. This will lead to a more complex expression involving hyperbolic functions and possibly an additional integration.\\n\\nAfter integrating, we get an expression that involves both ln(sinh(x) + cosh(x)) and x*ln(sinh(x) + cosh(x)), along with another term that results from the integration by parts. The expression for the indefinite integral is:\\n\\n\u222b(1 + x)/sinh(x) dx = ln(sinh(x) + cosh(x)) + x*ln(sinh(x) + cosh(x)) + C\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the expression gives us:\\n\\nln(sinh(4) + cosh(4)) + 4*ln(sinh(4) + cosh(4)) + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to round down to the nearest integer, we can ignore the constant C and calculate the numerical value of the expression without it.
