Let u = x and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = dx and v = e^x.

However, this is related to the Gaussian integral, which is an important concept in probability theory and has a value of sqrt(\u03c0)/2 when evaluated from 0 to infinity. For an indefinite integral, we would write \u222b e^(-x^2) dx = (1/2) * sqrt(\u03c0) * erfi(x) + C, where erfi(x) is the imaginary error function and C is the constant of integration.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function e^x^2:\\n\\n**Original Problem:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x^2, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n- **Solution to Original Problem:** The integral of e^x^2 is not expressible in terms of elementary functions. However, the definite integral from 0 to a (where a is any positive number) can be related to the error function, erf(x), which is defined as (2/\u221a\u03c0) * \u222b_0^x e^(-t^2) dt. The indefinite integral can be expressed as \u222b e^x^2 dx = (1/2) * sqrt(\u03c0) * erf(x) + C. To find the value at x = 4, we substitute into erf(x), but since erf(x) is not an elementary function, we would typically use numerical methods to approximate the value. Assuming we have the value of erf(4) or can approximate it, we would then calculate (1/2) * sqrt(\u03c0) * erf(4).\\n\\nHowever, since we need to provide the integer result by rounding down, we must approximate erf(4) and then multiply by (1/2) * sqrt(\u03c0) and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nThe error function erf(4) is approximately 0.9999683397. Multiplying this by (1/2) * sqrt(\u03c0) gives us approximately 0.9999683397 * 0.8862269255 \u2248 0.8862269255.

As mentioned before, the integral of e^(x^2) cannot be expressed in elementary functions, so we will leave it as an unevaluated integral, say I. The integral of x is (1/2)x^2 + C. Therefore, the indefinite integral of e^(x^2) + x is I + (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the expression, we get I + (1/2)(4)^2 + C = I + 8 + C. Since I cannot be evaluated exactly, we cannot get an exact numerical result. However, we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down. Since the term 8 + C is an integer and we are rounding down, the term I (the integral of e^(x^2)) can be ignored for the purpose of rounding, as any non-integer value would not affect the rounding down process.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8\""}]
