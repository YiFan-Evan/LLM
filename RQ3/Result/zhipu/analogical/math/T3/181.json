However, if we were to numerically approximate this integral and then evaluate it at x = 4, we would get a numerical value.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of x * e^x^2.\\n   Solution: This integral requires integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^x^2 dx. Then du = dx and v is the antiderivative of e^x^2 dx, which, as previously stated, cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, the product rule in reverse (integration by parts) can be used to express the integral as x * e^x^2 - \u222be^x^2 dx, which still leaves us with an expression that cannot be evaluated in closed form.\\n\\n2.

The integral of e^(x^2) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions, but the integral of x^2 is straightforward: \u222bx^2 dx = (1/3)x^3 + C.

As mentioned earlier, the integral of e^x^2 cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, so we would leave it as an unevaluated integral. However, the integral of x is (1/2)x^2 + C. Thus, the indefinite integral of e^x^2 + x is \u222be^x^2 dx + (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\nTo find the value at x = 4, we would plug 4 into the expression we have for the integral:\\n\\n\u222be^x^2 dx (from 0 to 4) + (1/2)(4)^2 + C - [\u222be^x^2 dx (from 0 to 0) + (1/2)(0)^2 + C]\\n\\nSince the integral of e^x^2 from 0 to 0 is 0, this simplifies to:\\n\\n\u222be^x^2 dx (from 0 to 4) + 8 + C - C\\n\\nThe term with C cancels out, and we are left with:\\n\\n\u222be^x^2 dx (from 0 to 4) + 8\\n\\nThe term \u222be^x^2 dx (from 0 to 4) is a number that must be approximated numerically.
