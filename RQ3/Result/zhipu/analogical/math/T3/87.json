To solve it, we would use integration by parts, but it's important to choose u and dv correctly to simplify the process.\\n   - **Solution**: Let u = sin(ln(x)) and dv = dx. Then, du = cos(ln(x))/x dx and v = x. The integral becomes:\\n     \u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = x sin(ln(x)) - \u222b x cos(ln(x))/x dx = x sin(ln(x)) - \u222b cos(ln(x)) dx.\\n     Now, we would solve \u222b cos(ln(x)) dx using substitution, let w = ln(x), dw = 1/x dx, and the integral becomes \u222b cos(w) dw = sin(w) + C = sin(ln(x)) + C. The final result is x sin(ln(x)) - sin(ln(x)) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of e^(ln(x)).\\n   - **Description**: This problem is straightforward because e^(ln(x)) simplifies to x. The integral of x with respect to x is a basic integral that most students encounter early in calculus.\\n   - **Solution**: Since e^(ln(x)) = x, the integral is simply the integral of x, which is (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of x * cos(ln(x)).\\n   - **Description**: This problem requires using integration by parts twice or recognizing a pattern that allows for a single substitution. It's a bit more complex than the first two problems.\\n   - **Solution**: Let u = x and dv = cos(ln(x)) dx. Then, du = dx and v = \u222b cos(ln(x)) dx. We can use the result from Problem 1 to find v, which is sin(ln(x)) + C. So the integral becomes x sin(ln(x)) - \u222b sin(ln(x)) dx. We then need to integrate sin(ln(x)) again, which we can do by another substitution or by recognizing that it's the derivative of -cos(ln(x)). So the final result is x sin(ln(x)) + cos(ln(x)) + C.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(ln(x)), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nTo integrate cos(ln(x)), we use substitution. Let u = ln(x), then du = 1/x dx, and the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b cos(ln(x)) dx = \u222b cos(u) du = sin(u) + C = sin(ln(x)) + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the result:\\n\\nsin(ln(4)) + C.\\n\\nSince we're not interested in the constant C for the final integer result, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer value at x = 4:\\n\\nsin(ln(4)).\\n\\nUsing a calculator to find sin(ln(4)) gives a decimal value.
