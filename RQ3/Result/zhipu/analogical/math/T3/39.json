Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 1/x.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of 1/x is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of x, denoted as \u222b(1/x)dx = ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2.

Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = (1/x) + x.\\n   Solution: The integral of (1/x) is ln|x|, and the integral of x is (1/2)x^2.
