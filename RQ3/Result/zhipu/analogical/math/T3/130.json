However, using integration by parts, we can express it as:\\n     \\\\[ \\\\int ln(cos(x)) dx = x*ln(cos(x)) - \\\\int x * d(ln(cos(x))) \\\\]\\n     Since the derivative of `ln(cos(x))` is `1/cos(x) * (-sin(x))`, we have:\\n     \\\\[ \\\\int ln(cos(x)) dx = x*ln(cos(x)) + \\\\int sin(x) dx \\\\]\\n     \\\\[ \\\\int ln(cos(x)) dx = x*ln(cos(x)) - cos(x) + C \\\\]\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function `e^x * sin(x)`. \\n   - **Solution**: This integral can be solved using integration by parts twice. Let `u = sin(x)` and `dv = e^x dx`. Then `du = cos(x) dx` and `v = e^x`. The first integration by parts gives:\\n     \\\\[ \\\\int e^x * sin(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) - \\\\int e^x * cos(x) dx \\\\]\\n     For the integral `\u222b e^x * cos(x) dx`, we can use integration by parts again with `u = cos(x)` and `dv = e^x dx`. This gives:\\n     \\\\[ \\\\int e^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * cos(x) - \\\\int e^x * (-sin(x)) dx \\\\]\\n     \\\\[ \\\\int e^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * cos(x) + \\\\int e^x * sin(x) dx \\\\]\\n     Solving for the original integral, we get:\\n     \\\\[ \\\\int e^x * sin(x) dx = \\\\frac{e^x * (sin(x) - cos(x))}{2} + C \\\\]\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function `x / (1 + x^2)`. \\n   - **Solution**: This integral can be solved by recognizing that the derivative of `1 + x^2` is `2x`, which suggests a substitution of `u = 1 + x^2`. However, the direct substitution is not necessary here. We can rewrite the integral as:\\n     \\\\[ \\\\int x / (1 + x^2) dx = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int 2x / (1 + x^2) dx \\\\]\\n     Recognizing that `d(1 + x^2) = 2x dx`, we can now integrate:\\n     \\\\[ \\\\int x / (1 + x^2) dx = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln(1 + x^2) + C \\\\]\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, we need to integrate the function `ln(sin(x))` and then evaluate the result at `x = 4`.
