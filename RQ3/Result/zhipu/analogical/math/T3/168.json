Let u = ln(x) and dv = e^(-x) dx. Then, du = 1/x dx and v = -e^(-x). Applying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222bln(x)/e^x dx = -ln(x)e^(-x) - \u222b(-e^(-x))(1/x) dx\\n                 = -ln(x)e^(-x) + \u222be^(-x)/x dx\\n\\nThe integral \u222be^(-x)/x dx does not have a simple closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions and is known as the exponential integral Ei(-x).
