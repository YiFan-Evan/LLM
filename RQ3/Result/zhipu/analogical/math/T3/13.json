Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x) - x.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of cos(x) is sin(x) + C, and the indefinite integral of -x is -1/2x^2 + C. Therefore, the indefinite integral of cos(x) - x is sin(x) - 1/2x^2 + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function 2cos(x) + 3x^2.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of 2cos(x) is 2sin(x) + C, and the indefinite integral of 3x^2 is x^3 + C.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function xcos(x).\\n   Solution: This requires integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = cos(x)dx. Then du = dx and v = sin(x). Using the integration by parts formula, the integral of xcos(x) is xsin(x) - \u222bsin(x)dx, which simplifies to xsin(x) + cos(x) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x) + x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution:\\nThe indefinite integral of cos(x) is sin(x) + C, and the indefinite integral of x is 1/2x^2 + C. Therefore, the indefinite integral of cos(x) + x is sin(x) + 1/2x^2 + C.\\n\\nSubstituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral result gives us sin(4) + 1/2(4)^2 + C, which simplifies to sin(4) + 8 + C.\\n\\nSince we're asked to round down to the nearest integer and the constant C does not affect the rounding, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer result. The sine of 4 radians is a transcendental number, and 8 is an integer. Adding these, we get a number that is greater than 8 but less than 9 when considering sin(4), which is between -1 and 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8 (since the sum will be slightly more than 8 but less than 9, rounding down gives us 8).\""}]
