Therefore, the indefinite integral is \u222b cos(x)/x dx = Ci(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x/x.\\n   - **Solution B**: Similar to Problem A, the integral of e^x/x also doesn't have a simple elementary form. It is related to the exponential integral function, denoted as Ei(x). So, the indefinite integral is \u222b e^x/x dx = Ei(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Calculate the indefinite integral of tan(x)/x.\\n   - **Solution C**: The integral of tan(x)/x can be expressed in terms of the logarithmic integral function, Li(x), for the real part, and involves complex numbers for the imaginary part due to the presence of the tangent function. The indefinite integral can be expressed as \u222b tan(x)/x dx = Li(x) + i*ln|cos(x)| + C, where C is the constant of integration and i is the imaginary unit.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function sinh(x)/x:\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of sinh(x)/x is not expressible in terms of elementary functions.

Thus, the indefinite integral of (sinh(x)/x) + 1 is the sum of the integral of sinh(x)/x and the integral of 1, which is \u222b (sinh(x)/x + 1) dx = \u222b sinh(x)/x dx + x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Calculate the indefinite integral of (sinh(x)/x) - x.\\n   - **Solution B**: Here, we would subtract the integral of x from the integral of sinh(x)/x. The integral of x is (1/2)x^2. The indefinite integral of (sinh(x)/x) - x is \u222b (sinh(x)/x - x) dx = \u222b sinh(x)/x dx - (1/2)x^2 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Calculate the indefinite integral of x/(x^2 + 1).\\n   - **Solution C**: This integral can be solved using a simple substitution. The indefinite integral of x/(x^2 + 1) is (1/2)ln(x^2 + 1) + C, where C is the constant of integration. This is because the derivative of (1/2)ln(x^2 + 1) is x/(x^2 + 1).\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function (sinh(x)/x) + x:\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of the function (sinh(x)/x) + x can be found by integrating each term separately. As mentioned earlier, the integral of sinh(x)/x is not expressible in terms of elementary functions and involves the hyperbolic sine integral function, Sh(x), but the integral of x is simple. Therefore, the indefinite integral is:\\n\\n\u222b (sinh(x)/x + x) dx = \u222b sinh(x)/x dx + \u222b x dx = Sh(x) + (1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem, we need to substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral and then round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\nSh(4) + (1/2)(4)^2 + C = Sh(4) + 8 + C\\n\\nSince we're only interested in the integer part and rounding down, and C will not affect the rounding down process, we can ignore it for this purpose.
