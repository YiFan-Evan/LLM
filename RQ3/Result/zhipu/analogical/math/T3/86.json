We already know how to integrate e^x and x from the previous problems. The integral of e^x/cos(x) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions, so we would typically leave it as an antiderivative or use numerical methods to approximate it. Let's denote the antiderivative of e^x/cos(x) as F(x) and the integral of x as G(x).\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of f(x) is F(x) + G(x), which is the antiderivative of e^x/cos(x) plus (1/2)x^2, plus the constant of integration C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into this result gives us F(4) + G(4).
