By using integration by parts, where we let `u = ln(x)` and `dv = dx`, we get `du = 1/x dx` and `v = x`. Applying the integration by parts formula, we get:\\n   \u222b ln(x) dx = x*ln(x) - \u222b x*(1/x) dx = x*ln(x) - \u222b 1 dx = x*ln(x) - x + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function `x*ln(x)` with respect to `x`.\\n\\n   **Solution 2**: This problem also requires integration by parts. Let `u = ln(x)` and `dv = x dx`. Then, `du = 1/x dx` and `v = x^2/2`. Using the integration by parts formula:\\n   \u222b x*ln(x) dx = x^2/2 * ln(x) - \u222b x^2/2 * (1/x) dx = x^2/2 * ln(x) - \u222b x/2 dx = x^2/2 * ln(x) - x^2/4 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function `ln(x)^2` with respect to `x`.\\n\\n   **Solution 3**: Integrating `ln(x)^2` is more complex and requires a special function or a series expansion. However, it can be approached using integration by parts repeatedly or by recognizing it as part of a more general formula for integrating powers of logarithms. The result is not elementary and involves the dilogarithm function (also known as the Spence's function). For the sake of this example, we'll state the result without derivation:\\n   \u222b ln(x)^2 dx = x*ln(x)^2/2 - 2x*ln(x)/2 + 2x/2 + C = x*ln(x)^2/2 - x*ln(x) + x + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function `ln(x)*ln(x)` with respect to `x`, then substitute `x=4` into the result and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution for the Original Problem**: The integral of `ln(x)*ln(x)` can be derived using the result from Problem 3 or by applying integration by parts twice.
