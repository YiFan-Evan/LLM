Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x * sin(x).\\n   Solution: To integrate e^x * sin(x), we use integration by parts twice. Let u = e^x and dv = sin(x)dx. Then, du = e^xdx and v = -cos(x). The integral becomes:\\n   \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx = e^x * (-cos(x)) - \u222b -cos(x) * e^x dx\\n   Now, we apply integration by parts again to \u222b -cos(x) * e^x dx with u = e^x and dv = -cos(x)dx. Then, du = e^xdx and v = sin(x). This gives us:\\n   \u222b -cos(x) * e^x dx = e^x * sin(x) - \u222b sin(x) * e^x dx\\n   Plugging this back into the original equation:\\n   \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx = -e^x * cos(x) + e^x * sin(x) - \u222b sin(x) * e^x dx\\n   Now, we recognize that \u222b sin(x) * e^x dx is just the original integral, so we can solve for it:\\n   2 * \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx = -e^x * cos(x) + e^x * sin(x)\\n   \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx = (-e^x * cos(x) + e^x * sin(x)) / 2\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function ln(x) * cos(x).\\n   Solution: Similar to the original problem, this requires integration by parts. Let u = ln(x) and dv = cos(x)dx. Then, du = 1/x dx and v = sin(x). The integral becomes:\\n   \u222b ln(x) * cos(x) dx = ln(x) * sin(x) - \u222b sin(x) * (1/x) dx\\n   Now, we integrate \u222b sin(x) * (1/x) dx by parts with u = sin(x) and dv = 1/x dx. Then, du = cos(x)dx and v = ln|x|. This gives us:\\n   \u222b sin(x) * (1/x) dx = sin(x) * ln|x| - \u222b cos(x) * ln|x| dx\\n   However, the integral \u222b cos(x) * ln|x| dx does not have a simple form and requires more advanced techniques or a numerical approximation.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function x * sin(x).\\n   Solution: To integrate x * sin(x), we use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = sin(x)dx. Then, du = dx and v = -cos(x). The integral becomes:\\n   \u222b x * sin(x) dx = x * (-cos(x)) - \u222b -cos(x) dx\\n   This simplifies to:\\n   \u222b x * sin(x) dx = -x * cos(x) + \u222b cos(x) dx\\n   \u222b x * sin(x) dx = -x * cos(x) + sin(x) + C\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nTo integrate ln(x) * sin(x), we use integration by parts. Let u = ln(x) and dv = sin(x)dx. Then, du = 1/x dx and v = -cos(x). The integral becomes:\\n\u222b ln(x) * sin(x) dx = ln(x) * (-cos(x)) - \u222b (-cos(x)) * (1/x) dx\\n\u222b ln(x) * sin(x) dx = -ln(x) * cos(x) + \u222b cos(x) / x dx\\n\\nThe integral \u222b cos(x) / x dx does not have a simple antiderivative in terms of elementary functions and would typically be expressed as an integral that cannot be evaluated further using standard techniques.\\n\\nHowever, for the purpose of this problem, we are not required to find a closed-form expression for the entire integral, only to evaluate the expression at x=4. Since we cannot find an exact antiderivative, we would typically use numerical methods to approximate the integral from 1 to 4. But since we are asked for an integer result by rounding down, we will consider the integral from 1 to 4 as an approximation problem.\\n\\nBy using numerical integration methods such as the trapezoidal rule or Simpson's rule, or by using a calculator or computer software, one would find an approximate value for the integral from 1 to 4. After obtaining this value, we would then round down to the nearest integer to get the final answer.\\n\\nSince I cannot perform this calculation directly here, let's assume that the numerical integration gives us an approximate value for the integral from 1 to 4. We would then round down to the nearest integer to get the final answer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The integer result from the numerical integration, which I cannot provide without actual computation.]\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)*sin(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Let's consider three related problems:\\n\\n1.
