Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = cos(x)sinh(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of cos(x)sinh(x) can be found using integration by parts. Let u = sinh(x) and dv = cos(x)dx. Then du = cosh(x)dx and v = sin(x). Applying integration by parts, we get:\\n   \u222b cos(x)sinh(x)dx = u*v - \u222b v*du\\n   = sinh(x)sin(x) - \u222b sin(x)cosh(x)dx\\n   To integrate \u222b sin(x)cosh(x)dx, we can use the same method again or recognize that cosh(x) = (e^x + e^(-x))/2 and sin(x) = (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))/(2i), but the integral will involve complex numbers, which we can avoid by using the substitution method. Let's substitute u = cos(x) and dv = sinh(x)dx. Then du = -sin(x)dx and v = cosh(x). Now we integrate:\\n   \u222b cos(x)sinh(x)dx = sinh(x)sin(x) + \u222b cos(x)cosh(x)dx\\n   = sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x) - \u222b cosh(x)(-sin(x))dx\\n   = sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x) + \u222b sin(x)cosh(x)dx\\n   Recognizing that we now have the same integral on both sides of the equation, we can solve for it:\\n   2\u222b cos(x)sinh(x)dx = sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x)\\n   \u222b cos(x)sinh(x)dx = (1/2)(sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x))\\n\\n2. Problem: Evaluate the definite integral of the function g(x) = cos(x)sinh(x) from 0 to \u03c0.\\n   Solution: To evaluate this definite integral, we use the antiderivative found in the first problem. We have:\\n   \u222b from 0 to \u03c0 cos(x)sinh(x)dx = [(1/2)(sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x))] from 0 to \u03c0\\n   Plugging in the limits of integration, we get:\\n   [(1/2)(sinh(\u03c0)sin(\u03c0) + cos(\u03c0)cosh(\u03c0))] - [(1/2)(sinh(0)sin(0) + cos(0)cosh(0))]\\n   Since sin(\u03c0) = 0, cos(\u03c0) = -1, sinh(0) = 0, and cosh(0) = 1, the expression simplifies to:\\n   (1/2)(0 + (-1)(cosh(\u03c0))) - (1/2)(0 + 1)\\n   = -(1/2)(cosh(\u03c0) + 1)\\n\\n3.
