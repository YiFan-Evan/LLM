Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x) + (1/x^2).\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of (1/x) is ln|x| and the integral of (1/x^2) is -1/(x-1). Thus, the integral is ln|x| - 1/(x-1). When x=4 is substituted, the result is ln|4| - 1/(4-1) = ln(4) - 1/3. Since we are asked for an integer result by rounding down, we do not need to calculate the exact value of ln(4) but only note that it is less than 2, and -1/3 is approximately -0.333. The integer part of ln(4) - 1/3 would be less than 1.5, so rounding down gives us 1.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (x+1)/x^2.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of (x+1)/x^2 can be split into the sum of the integrals of x/x^2 and 1/x^2, which simplifies to -1/x + 1/x. These two terms cancel each other out, so the indefinite integral is 0. Substituting x=4 into this result still gives us 0, and rounding down does not change this result. Therefore, the integer result is 0.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x) - (1/x^2).\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of (1/x) is ln|x|, and the integral of -(1/x^2) is 1/(x-1). So the integral of the entire function is ln|x| + 1/(x-1). Substituting x=4 into the result gives ln|4| + 1/(4-1) = ln(4) + 1/3. Since ln(4) is less than 2, and 1/3 is approximately 0.333, the sum would be less than 2.333. Rounding down gives us an integer result of 2.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function (1/x)*(1+x):\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of (1/x)*(1+x) can be calculated by distributing the integral over the terms inside the parentheses: the integral of (1/x) is ln|x|, and the integral of (1/x)*x is the integral of 1, which is x. Therefore, the indefinite integral of the original function is ln|x| + x.\\n\\nSubstituting x=4 into the result gives ln|4| + 4. Since ln(4) is less than 2, the sum of ln(4) and 4 is less than 6.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x) + x.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of (1/x) is ln|x|, and the integral of x with respect to x is (1/2)x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of the function is ln|x| + (1/2)x^2. When x=4 is substituted, the result is ln|4| + (1/2)*4^2 = ln(4) + 8. Since ln(4) is approximately 1.386, the sum is approximately 1.386 + 8 = 9.386. Rounding down gives us an integer result of 9.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x^2) + (1/x).\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of (1/x^2) is -1/x, and the integral of (1/x) is ln|x|. Thus, the indefinite integral of the function is -1/x + ln|x|. Substituting x=4 into the result gives -1/4 + ln(4), which is approximately -0.25 + 1.386 = 1.136. Rounding down gives us an integer result of 1.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function x/(1+x).\\n   Solution: This integral can be solved using a simple u-substitution. Let u = 1+x, then du/dx = 1 and dx = du. The integral becomes the integral of (u-1)/u du, which simplifies to the integral of 1 - 1/u du. The integral of 1 is u, and the integral of -1/u is -ln|u|. So the indefinite integral is u - ln|u| + C, which simplifies back to x - ln(1+x) + C when substituting back. When x=4 is substituted, the result is 4 - ln(5). Since ln(5) is approximately 1.609, the result is approximately 4 - 1.609 = 2.391. Rounding down gives us an integer result of 2.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function (1/x)*(1+x) + x:\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of (1/x)*(1+x) can be calculated by distributing the integral over the terms inside the parentheses: the integral of (1/x) is ln|x|, the integral of (1/x)*x (which simplifies to 1) is x, and the integral of x is (1/2)x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of the original function is ln|x| + x + (1/2)x^2.\\n\\nSubstituting x=4 into the result gives ln|4| + 4 + (1/2)*4^2 = ln(4) + 4 + 8. Since ln(4) is approximately 1.386, the sum is approximately 1.386 + 4 + 8 = 13.386. Rounding down gives us the integer result of 13.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 13.\""}]
