Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/(x^2))cos(x).\\n   Solution: To integrate (1/(x^2))cos(x), we use integration by parts. Let u = cos(x) and dv = (1/x^2)dx. Then, du = -sin(x)dx and v = -1/x. Using the integration by parts formula, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get:\\n   \u222b(1/(x^2))cos(x)dx = -cos(x)/x - \u222b(-1/x)(-sin(x))dx = -cos(x)/x + \u222bsin(x)/x dx.\\n   The integral \u222bsin(x)/x dx is known as the sine integral (Si(x)), which does not have a simple closed-form expression. Thus, the integral is -cos(x)/x + Si(x) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function x/(x^2 + 1).\\n   Solution: The integral of x/(x^2 + 1) can be found using a simple substitution. Let u = x^2 + 1, then du/dx = 2x, or dx = du/(2x). Substituting into the integral, we get:\\n   \u222bx/(x^2 + 1)dx = \u222b(1/2)(du/u) = (1/2)ln|u| + C = (1/2)ln|x^2 + 1| + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)tan(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of (1/x)tan(x) is a bit more complex and typically requires integration by parts. However, tan(x) can be rewritten as sin(x)/cos(x), so the integral becomes:\\n   \u222b(1/x)tan(x)dx = \u222b(1/x)(sin(x)/cos(x))dx = \u222bsin(x)/x*cos(x)dx.\\n   This can be solved using integration by parts or by recognizing that it's related to the integral of sin(x)/x, which is known as the sine integral (Si(x)). The exact antiderivative is not elementary, but it can be expressed in terms of Si(x) and Ci(x) (cosine integral), which are special functions.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)/cos(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of (1/x)/cos(x) can be approached by recognizing that it's similar to the integral of sec(x)/x, which does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. However, for the sake of this problem, let's denote the integral of sec(x)/x as Si_sec(x) + C, where Si_sec(x) is a special function similar to the sine integral but for sec(x).\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)/cos(x)dx = \u222bsec(x)/x dx = Si_sec(x) + C.\\n\\nNow, we substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\nSi_sec(4) + C.\\n\\nSince we don't have an explicit expression for Si_sec(x), we cannot calculate an exact numerical value. However, if we were to use numerical methods to approximate Si_sec(4), we would then round down to the nearest integer to provide the final answer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [This would be a placeholder for the integer result if we had the capability to compute Si_sec(4).

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)sec(x).\\n   Solution: This integral does not have a simple antiderivative in terms of elementary functions. However, it is related to the integral of sec(x)/x, which is known as the secant integral (Si_sec(x)). The integral can be expressed as Si_sec(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function x.\\n   Solution: The integral of x with respect to x is straightforward. It is given by the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n dx is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is not equal to -1. For x, n = 1, so the integral is (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the sum of the functions (1/x)sec(x) and x.\\n   Solution: The integral of a sum of functions is equal to the sum of the integrals of the individual functions. Therefore, we can integrate (1/x)sec(x) and x separately and then add the results:\\n   \u222b[(1/x)sec(x) + x]dx = \u222b(1/x)sec(x)dx + \u222bxdx = Si_sec(x) + (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)/cos(x) + x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: Using the result from the third related problem, we can write the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)/cos(x) + x as Si_sec(x) + (1/2)x^2 + C.
