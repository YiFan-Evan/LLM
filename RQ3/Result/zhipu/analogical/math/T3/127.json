Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^2 * e^x.\\n   Solution: To integrate f(x) = x^2 * e^x, we use integration by parts. Let u = x^2 and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = 2x dx and v = e^x. Using the formula for integration by parts, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get:\\n   \u222bx^2 * e^x dx = x^2 * e^x - \u222b2x * e^x dx.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x/e^x.\\n   Solution: To integrate g(x) = x/e^x, we can rewrite it as x * e^(-x) and use substitution. Let u = -x, then du = -dx. The integral becomes:\\n   \u222bx * e^(-x) dx = -\u222bu * e^u du. Integrating by parts with u = u and dv = e^u du, we get v = e^u.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = x^3/e^x.\\n   Solution: To integrate h(x) = x^3 * e^x, we again use integration by parts. Let u = x^3 and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = 3x^2 dx and v = e^x. Using integration by parts, we get:\\n   \u222bx^3 * e^x dx = x^3 * e^x - \u222b3x^2 * e^x dx. This process will require two more applications of integration by parts.
