The integral of x^2 is (1/3)x^3, and the integral of x is (1/2)x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of x^2 + x is (1/3)x^3 + (1/2)x^2 + C. Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives (1/3)(4)^3 + (1/2)(4)^2 + C = (1/3)(64) + (1/2)(16) + C = 64/3 + 8/2 + C = 64/3 + 4 + C. To get the integer result by rounding down, we consider only the numerical part without the constant C, which is 64/3 + 4. Calculating this gives approximately 21.333 + 4 = 25.333.
