Let u = x^2, then du/dx = 2x, or dx = du/(2x).

So, h'(x) = x^3 * sinh(x^2). However, since we have an x^3 term multiplied by the integrand from Problem A, we would need to apply the product rule as well. The derivative would be:\\n     h'(x) = d/dx [\u222bx^3 * sinh(x^2) dx] = x^3 * sinh(x^2) + 3x^2 * \u222bsinh(x^2) dx.
