Evaluating this at x = 0 gives e^0 + C = 1 + C. Since we are not given a value for C, we cannot provide a numerical result, but the expression simplifies to 1 + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Find the definite integral of f(x) = e^x from x = 0 to x = 2.\\n   - **Solution 2:** The definite integral of e^x from 0 to 2 is calculated by subtracting the value of the integral at the lower bound from the value at the upper bound. Thus, it is e^2 - e^0 = e^2 - 1. This does not involve an indefinite integral and a substitution, but it shows the application of the function within a specific interval.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Compute the indefinite integral of f(x) = e^x, then substitute x = 1 into the result and provide the integer part of the answer.\\n   - **Solution 3:** The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C. Substituting x = 1 gives e^1 + C = e + C. Since e is approximately 2.71828, the expression becomes 2.71828 + C. To provide the integer part, we ignore C (as it's unknown) and round down e to 2.

Since integration is linear, the integral of the sum is the sum of the integrals, so the indefinite integral of f(x) = e^x + x is e^x + x^2/2 + C, where C = C1 + C2 is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Evaluate the definite integral of the function f(x) = e^x + x from x = 0 to x = 1.\\n   - **Solution 2:** The definite integral is found by calculating the antiderivative and then evaluating it at the bounds. The antiderivative is e^x + x^2/2 + C. Evaluating this from x = 0 to x = 1 gives (e^1 + 1^2/2 + C) - (e^0 + 0^2/2 + C) = (e + 1/2) - (1 + 0) = e + 1/2 - 1 = e - 1/2.

Substituting x = 3 gives e^3 + 3^2/2 + C = e^3 + 9/2 + C. The value of e^3 is approximately 20.0855. Adding 9/2 to this gives approximately 20.0855 + 4.5 = 24.5855.
