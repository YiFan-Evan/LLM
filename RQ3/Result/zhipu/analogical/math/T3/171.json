However, if we consider the substitution u = sin(x), then du = cos(x) dx, and the integral becomes \u222b 1/u du = ln|u| + C.

Since we are asked for the integer part by rounding down, we can ignore the constant C (as it will not affect the rounding down process) and focus on ln|sin(4)|. The value of sin(4) is negative because 4 radians is in the third quadrant where sine is negative.
