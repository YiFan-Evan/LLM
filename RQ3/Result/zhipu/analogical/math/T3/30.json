When we multiply e^x by a constant, the constant also gets multiplied to the integral. Thus, the integral of 3e^x is 3e^x + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^(-2x).\\n   - **Description**: In this problem, we are dealing with a function that is e^x with a negative exponent, which means we need to account for the chain rule when integrating.\\n   - **Solution**: The integral of e^(-2x) is not straightforward since it requires substitution. By letting u = -2x, du = -2dx, and dividing both sides by -2, we get du/(-2) = dx. The integral becomes (-1/2) * integral of e^u, which is (-1/2)e^u + C.

Then, du = 2x dx and v = e^x. Applying the integration by parts formula (uv - \u222bv du), we get x^2e^x - \u222b2xe^x dx.
