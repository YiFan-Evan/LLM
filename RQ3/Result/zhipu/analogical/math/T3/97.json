Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x) + sinh(x).\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C1, and the indefinite integral of sinh(x) is cosh(x) + C2.

We've already discussed that the integral of sin(x)*sinh(x) does not have a simple form, but we can leave it as an antiderivative expression. The integral of x is (1/2)x^2.

Since we don't have an explicit form for the antiderivative of sin(x)*sinh(x), we would typically use numerical methods to approximate this value. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume we've found that value and denote it as A.
