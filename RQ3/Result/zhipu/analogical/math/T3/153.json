Substituting x = 4 into this result gives us ln(4) + C. Since we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, and we're not given a specific value for C, we can ignore it for the purpose of this calculation. The natural logarithm of 4, ln(4), is approximately 1.386294.

Since these are two separate terms, we can integrate them separately and then combine them. Thus, the indefinite integral of f(x) is ln|x| + (1/2)x^2 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Evaluate the definite integral of the function f(x) = 1/x + x from 1 to 2.\\n   - **Solution 2**: To evaluate this definite integral, we calculate the antiderivative of the function, which we found in Problem 1 to be ln|x| + (1/2)x^2 + C. We then apply the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus by subtracting the value of the antiderivative at the lower limit (x = 1) from the value at the upper limit (x = 2). This gives us [ln(2) + (1/2)(2)^2] - [ln(1) + (1/2)(1)^2] = ln(2) + 2 - 0 - 1/2 = ln(2) + 1.5.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Determine the average value of the function f(x) = 1/x + x on the interval [1, 3].\\n   - **Solution 3**: The average value of a function on an interval [a, b] is given by (1/(b-a)) times the definite integral of the function from a to b. From Problem 2, we know how to integrate f(x), so we can use that to find the average value. The integral from 1 to 3 is [ln(3) + (1/2)(3)^2] - [ln(1) + (1/2)(1)^2] = ln(3) + 4.5 - 0 - 0.5 = ln(3) + 4.

Substituting x = 4 into this result gives us ln(4) + (1/2)(4)^2 + C = ln(4) + 8 + C. Ignoring the constant C for the purpose of this calculation, we have ln(4) + 8. Since ln(4) is approximately 1.386294, the expression simplifies to 1.386294 + 8 \u2248 9.386294. Rounding down, we get 9.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9\""}]
