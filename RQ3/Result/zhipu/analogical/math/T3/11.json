Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x) with respect to x.\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the definite integral of sin(x) from 0 to \u03c0.\\n   Solution: The definite integral is calculated by taking the antiderivative of the function and evaluating it at the limits of integration. Thus, we have (-cos(x) + C) from 0 to \u03c0, which simplifies to (-cos(\u03c0) + C) - (-cos(0) + C) = (1 + C) - (-1 + C) = 2.\\n\\n3.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x) + x with respect to x.\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C1, and the integral of x is (1/2)x^2 + C2. Since integration is linear, the integral of the sum is the sum of the integrals. Thus, the indefinite integral of sin(x) + x is -cos(x) + (1/2)x^2 + C, where C is the sum of the constants of integration C1 and C2.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the definite integral of the function sin(x) + x from 0 to \u03c0.\\n   Solution: Using the indefinite integral found in the first problem, we evaluate it at the limits of integration: [-cos(x) + (1/2)x^2 + C] from 0 to \u03c0. This gives us [-cos(\u03c0) + (1/2)\u03c0^2 + C] - [-cos(0) + (1/2)0^2 + C] = [1 + (1/2)\u03c0^2 + C] - [1 + C] = (1/2)\u03c0^2.\\n\\n3. Problem: Evaluate the definite integral of the function sin(x) + x from -\u03c0 to \u03c0.\\n   Solution: Since sin(x) is an odd function and x is an even function, the integral of sin(x) over a symmetric interval around 0 will cancel out, resulting in 0. However, the integral of x over the same interval will not cancel out because x is an odd function. The integral of x from -\u03c0 to \u03c0 is [0.5x^2] from -\u03c0 to \u03c0, which simplifies to 0.5\u03c0^2 - 0.5(-\u03c0)^2 = 0.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x) + x, substitute 'x=4' into the result, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of sin(x) + x is -cos(x) + (1/2)x^2 + C. Substituting 'x=4' into this expression gives us -cos(4) + (1/2)4^2 + C = -cos(4) + 8 + C.
