Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x^2).\\n   Solution: The integral of cos(x^2) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. It involves a special function called the Fresnel integral, which is not an elementary function. However, for the sake of the exercise, we would leave the integral as \u222bcos(x^2)dx, since we cannot evaluate it further without numerical methods or special functions.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(sinh(x)).\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(sinh(x)) can be evaluated by using a substitution. Let u = cosh(x), then du/dx = sinh(x), and dx = du/sinh(x). The integral becomes \u222bsin(sinh(x))dx = \u222bsin(u)du/sinh(x). Since sin(u)/sinh(x) simplifies to tanh(x/2) when u = cosh(x), the integral becomes \u222btanh(x/2)dx. This integral is \u222bsinh(x)/cosh(x)dx, which equals ln(cosh(x)) + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(exp(x)).\\n   Solution: Similar to the first problem, the integral of cos(exp(x)) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

However, if we were to integrate it numerically or use special functions, we would then evaluate the result at x = 4. Since we cannot perform this integration analytically, we would typically use numerical methods to approximate the integral and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nSince I'm unable to perform numerical integration here, I can't provide the exact integer result.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x) + x.\\n   Solution: The integral of a sum of functions is the sum of the integrals of each function. The integral of cos(x) is sin(x) + C, and the integral of x is (1/2)x^2 + C. Therefore, the indefinite integral of cos(x) + x is sin(x) + (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x) + cos(sinh(x)).\\n   Solution: The integral of sinh(x) is cosh(x) + C. The integral of cos(sinh(x)) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, but since we are adding it to sinh(x), we can write the indefinite integral as cosh(x) + \u222bcos(sinh(x))dx + C. The integral \u222bcos(sinh(x))dx would typically require numerical methods or special functions to evaluate.\\n\\n3.

As established earlier, the integral of x is (1/2)x^2 + C. The integral of cos(sinh(x)) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, but we can write the indefinite integral as \u222bcos(sinh(x))dx + (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the result, we get:\\n\\n\u222bcos(sinh(x))dx evaluated at x = 4 + (1/2)(4)^2 + C\\n= \u222bcos(sinh(4))dx + 8 + C\\n\\nSince we cannot calculate the integral of cos(sinh(x)) analytically, we would need to use numerical methods to approximate the value of \u222bcos(sinh(4))dx. After obtaining this numerical value, we would add 8 to it (since (1/2)(4)^2 = 8) and then round down to the nearest integer to get the final result.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The integer result obtained by numerically integrating cos(sinh(x)) from 0 to 4, adding 8, and rounding down.] \\n\\nPlease note that this answer cannot be computed here without numerical tools.\""}]
