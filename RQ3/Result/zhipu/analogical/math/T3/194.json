Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x * ln(x) * ln(x).\\n   Solution: To integrate f(x) = x * ln(x) * ln(x), we can use integration by parts twice. First, let u = ln(x) and dv = x * ln(x) dx. Then, we integrate dv and differentiate u. After applying integration by parts once, we'll need to apply it again on the resulting integral.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = (1 + 2x) * ln(x) * ln(x).\\n   Solution: This problem is similar to the first, but with an additional 2x term inside the parentheses. We would still use integration by parts, but the resulting expression would be different due to the extra term. The integral of the 2x term is straightforward, but it will affect the overall integration process.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = (1 + x) * ln(x) and then evaluate it at x = 4.\\n   Solution: This integral is simpler than the original function because it lacks the additional multiplication by ln(x).

Let's consider the integral:\\n\\n\u222b (1+x)*ln(x)*ln(x) dx\\n\\nThis is a bit tricky because we have two logarithmic functions. We can start by using integration by parts with u = ln(x)*ln(x) and dv = (1+x) dx. Then, we would find du and v, integrate v, and multiply u by v. Then we subtract the integral of the product of du and v. This process will likely need to be repeated or require additional techniques such as substitution.\\n\\nHowever, this integral does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, and solving it requires more advanced techniques or approximations. Since the actual integration process is complex and involves special functions, we'll state the integral solution conceptually:\\n\\nLet I be the integral of (1+x)*ln(x)*ln(x). We would then calculate I and evaluate I(4) to find the value at x = 4.\\n\\nSince the actual calculation is beyond the scope of a simple explanation and would likely result in an expression involving the dilogarithm function (or similar special function), which cannot be simplified to an integer without numerical methods, I will provide the conceptual solution:\\n\\n\u222b (1+x)*ln(x)*ln(x) dx = I\\nI(4) = numerical evaluation of I at x = 4\\nRound down I(4) to get the integer result.\\n\\nTherefore, to find the final answer, one would typically use numerical integration methods to evaluate I(4) and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nSince I cannot perform this numerical integration, I cannot provide the final integer result directly. If you have access to a computational tool or software capable of symbolic and numerical integration, you can use it to find the value of I(4) and then round down to get the integer result.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x * ln(x) * ln(x) + x.\\n   Solution: This integral can be split into two separate integrals. The first part is the integral of x * ln(x) * ln(x), which can be approached using integration by parts as described in the previous response. The second part, the integral of x, is straightforward since it's a basic polynomial term. We integrate each part separately and then combine the results.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = (1+x) * ln(x) * ln(x) + 1.\\n   Solution: Similar to the first problem, this integral can be separated into the integral of (1+x) * ln(x) * ln(x) and the integral of 1.
