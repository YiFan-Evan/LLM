Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cosh(e^x).\\n   Solution: The integral of cosh(e^x) with respect to x can be found using a substitution. Let u = e^x, then du/dx = e^x and dx = du/e^x. The integral becomes \u222b cosh(u) du/e^x. Since cosh(u) = (e^u + e^(-u))/2, the integral simplifies to \u222b (e^u + e^(-u))/2 du/e^x. The e^x in the denominator cancels with the e^x in the numerator for the first term, and we are left with \u222b (1/2)e^u du + \u222b (1/2)e^(-u)/e^x du. The integral of e^u is e^u/1, and the second term simplifies to 1/2\u222b e^(-2x) du, which does not integrate to a simple expression involving e^x. So the indefinite integral is (1/2)e^x + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function sinh(e^x) + cosh(e^x).\\n   Solution: This problem combines both hyperbolic functions. Using the same substitution as before, u = e^x, we have du = e^x dx. The integral becomes \u222b (sinh(u) + cosh(u)) du. Since sinh(u) = (e^u - e^(-u))/2 and cosh(u) = (e^u + e^(-u))/2, the integral simplifies to \u222b (e^u - e^(-u) + e^u + e^(-u))/2 du. This further simplifies to \u222b e^u du, which integrates to e^u/1 + C. Substituting back u = e^x gives us e^x + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Compute the indefinite integral of the function e^x sinh(e^x).\\n   Solution: This problem involves a product of e^x and sinh(e^x). Using the substitution u = e^x, we get du = e^x dx. The integral then becomes \u222b e^x sinh(u) du. Since e^x is just u, the integral simplifies to \u222b u sinh(u) du. This integral can be solved using integration by parts. Letting v = sinh(u) and dw = u du, we have dv = cosh(u) du and w = u^2/2. The integral becomes u^2/2 sinh(u) - \u222b u^2/2 cosh(u) du. This integral does not have a simple closed form and requires special functions or numerical methods for evaluation.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of sinh(e^x) with respect to x can be found using the substitution u = e^x, du = e^x dx, which simplifies the integral to \u222b sinh(u) du. The integral of sinh(u) is cosh(u) + C. Substituting back u = e^x gives us cosh(e^x) + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into cosh(e^x) gives us cosh(e^4). Since cosh is an even function and e^4 is positive, we know that cosh(e^4) will be positive. However, without a calculator or software, we cannot find the exact numerical value of cosh(e^4).\\n\\nTo provide an integer result by rounding down, we would typically need to calculate the value and then round. Since I cannot perform this calculation exactly here, I can't provide the final integer result. If you have access to a calculator or software capable of calculating hyperbolic functions, you can use it to find cosh(e^4), and then round down to the nearest integer to get the final answer. \\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [You would need to calculate cosh(e^4) and round down to provide an integer result.]\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: sinh(e^x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Let's consider three related problems:\\n\\n1.
