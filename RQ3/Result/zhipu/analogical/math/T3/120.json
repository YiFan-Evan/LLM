Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(ln(x)).\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(ln(x)) with respect to x can be found using substitution. Let u = ln(x), then du/dx = 1/x, and dx = x du. The integral becomes \u222b sin(u) x du. Since x = e^u, the integral is \u222b sin(u) e^u du. This integral can be solved using integration by parts, and the result is -e^u cos(u) + C. Substituting back u = ln(x), we get -x cos(ln(x)) + C.\\n\\n2.

The integral of x with respect to x is straightforward, and the result is (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (ln(x))^2.\\n   Solution: The integral of (ln(x))^2 with respect to x is more complex and requires integration by parts twice. Let u = (ln(x))^2 and dv = dx. Then, du = 2ln(x)/x dx and v = x. The integral becomes x(ln(x))^2 - \u222b 2xln(x)/x dx. We apply integration by parts again on the remaining integral, and after solving, we get x(ln(x))^2 - 2x + 2\u222b dx, which simplifies to x(ln(x))^2 - 2x + 2x + C, or x(ln(x))^2 - 2x + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(ln(x)), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: To integrate cos(ln(x)), we can use a similar substitution method as before. Let u = ln(x), then du = dx/x, and dx = x du. The integral becomes \u222b cos(u) x du, which simplifies to \u222b x cos(u) du. This integral can be solved using integration by parts, where we let u = cos(u) and dv = x du. After solving, we will have an expression involving x and cos(u), and we will need to evaluate this expression at x = 4. The integral of cos(ln(x)) is x sin(ln(x)) + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral result, we get 4 sin(ln(4)) + C. Since we are asked to round down to the nearest integer and C is a constant that will not affect the rounding, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer result.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(ln(x)) + 1.\\n   Solution: This integral can be solved by separating the integral into two parts. The integral of sin(ln(x)) can be approached using substitution as described previously, while the integral of 1 is simply x. The combined integral is therefore -x cos(ln(x)) + x + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^(ln(x)) - x.\\n   Solution: As mentioned before, e^(ln(x)) simplifies to x. The integral of x is (1/2)x^2, and the integral of -x is simply -1/2x^2. Therefore, the combined integral is (1/2)x^2 - (1/2)x^2 + C, which simplifies to C since the x^2 terms cancel out.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (ln(x))^2 + x^2.\\n   Solution: The integral of (ln(x))^2 requires integration by parts as described earlier. The integral of x^2 is (1/3)x^3. The combined integral is x(ln(x))^2 - 2x + (1/3)x^3 + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(ln(x)) + x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of cos(ln(x)) + x can be found by integrating each term separately. As established, the integral of cos(ln(x)) is x sin(ln(x)) + C1, and the integral of x is (1/2)x^2 + C2.
