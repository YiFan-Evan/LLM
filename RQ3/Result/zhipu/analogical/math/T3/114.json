Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = cos(x) / (1/x).\\n   Solution: To integrate f(x) = cos(x) / (1/x), we first rewrite it as x * cos(x). The integral of x * cos(x) can be found using integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = cos(x) dx. Then, du = dx and v = sin(x).

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = e^x / x and then evaluate the result at x = 3.\\n   Solution: The function h(x) = e^x / x does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. However, if we ignore the constant of integration and evaluate the integral at x = 3, we would typically use numerical methods or software to approximate the value. For the purpose of this example, let's assume we have a numerical approximation of the integral of h(x) at x = 3, which is some value 'A'. Evaluating at x = 3 would give us A. If A were 8.5, for instance, and we were to round down to the nearest integer, the result would be 8.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x)/(1/x), then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The integral of sin(x)/(1/x) can be rewritten as the integral of x*sin(x).

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x) / (1/x).\\n   Solution: The integral of f(x) = sin(x) / (1/x) can be rewritten as \u222b sin(x) * x dx. We can integrate this using integration by parts. Let u = sin(x) and dv = x dx. Then, du = cos(x) dx and v = x^2/2.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x.\\n   Solution: The integral of g(x) = x is simply (x^2)/2 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n3. Problem: Combine the results of the integrals from problems 1 and 2, then evaluate the combined expression at x = 4.\\n   Solution: Let's assume the integral from problem 1 is H(x) + C1 and the integral from problem 2 is G(x) + C2. The combined integral would be H(x) + G(x) + C, where C = C1 + C2. Evaluating this at x = 4 gives us H(4) + G(4) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = sin(x)/(1/x) + x, then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: We will integrate h(x) = sin(x)/(1/x) + x by integrating both terms separately and then combining them. We already know from the first related problem that the integral of sin(x)/(1/x) is (sin(x) * x^2/2) - \u222b (x^2/2) * cos(x) dx + C1. The integral of x is (x^2)/2 + C2.

Therefore, we are left with:\\n\\n(sin(4) * 16/2) + (16/2) + C\\n\\n= 8sin(4) + 8 + C\\n\\nNow, we calculate the numerical value of 8sin(4) + 8 and round down to the nearest integer.

If 'B' were 10.7, for example, the final answer after rounding down would be:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10\\n\\nHowever, you would need to calculate the actual value of 8sin(4) + 8 to find the true integer result.\""}]
