Substituting `x = \u03c0/6` gives us `sin(\u03c0/6) + C`. Since `sin(\u03c0/6) = 1/2`, the expression simplifies to `1/2 + C`. Since we're asked for an integer value, and C is a constant that can be any real number, we can't determine a specific integer without knowing C.

Substituting `x = 4` gives us `-cos(4) + C`. The value of `-cos(4)` is a real number, but without knowing the specific value of C, we cannot determine the exact integer value. However, since we are asked to round down, we only need to consider the value of `-cos(4)` without C. The cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and since -cos(4) will be between -1 and 1 (because the cosine function's range is [-1, 1]), the expression `-cos(4)` will be between -1 and 0.

Without the constant C, the expression `\u221a3 + \u03c0/6` is approximately 1.732 + 0.5236, which is less than 2.5.
