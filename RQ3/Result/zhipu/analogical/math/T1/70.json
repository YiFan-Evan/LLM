Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x) * cosh(x).\\n\\n   Solution: To integrate sin(x) * cosh(x), we use integration by parts. Let u = sin(x) and dv = cosh(x)dx. Then, du = cos(x)dx and v = sinh(x). Applying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n   \u222b sin(x) * cosh(x)dx = uv - \u222b vdu\\n   = sin(x) * sinh(x) - \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x)dx\\n\\n   To integrate cos(x) * sinh(x), we again use integration by parts, but since we already have sin(x) * sinh(x), it's more convenient to express cos(x) as d(sinh(x)):\\n\\n   \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x)dx = sin(x) * sinh(x) - \u222b sinh(x)d(sinh(x))\\n   = sin(x) * sinh(x) - (1/2) * sinh^2(x) + C\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = cos(x) * sinh(x) + sin(x) * cosh(x).\\n\\n   Solution: This integral can be solved by recognizing that cos(x) * sinh(x) + sin(x) * cosh(x) is the derivative of sin(x) * sinh(x). Therefore, the integral is simply:\\n\\n   \u222b (cos(x) * sinh(x) + sin(x) * cosh(x))dx = sin(x) * sinh(x) + C\\n\\n3. Problem: Evaluate the integral of the function h(x) = cos(x) * cosh(x).\\n\\n   Solution: This integral can be approached by using the identity cos(x) * cosh(x) = (1/2)(e^x + e^(-x)) * cos(x). However, it's simpler to recognize that the derivative of sin(x) * cosh(x) includes cos(x) * cosh(x), so the integral is:\\n\\n   \u222b cos(x) * cosh(x)dx = sin(x) * cosh(x) + C\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x) * sinh(x), then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: We integrate cos(x) * sinh(x) using the same approach as in the first related problem, recognizing that the integral of cos(x) * sinh(x) will involve sin(x) * cosh(x):\\n\\n\u222b cos(x) * sinh(x)dx = sin(x) * cosh(x) - \u222b sin(x) * cosh(x)dx\\n\\nSince we already know that the integral of sin(x) * cosh(x) will involve an additional term with sinh^2(x), we can simplify our approach by directly integrating cos(x) * sinh(x) once:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x) * sinh(x)dx = sin(x) * cosh(x) + C\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral:\\n\\nsin(4) * cosh(4) + C\\n\\nTo find the integer result, we need to calculate sin(4) * cosh(4) and round down. Since the constant C does not affect the rounding down process, we can ignore it for this part.\\n\\nUsing a calculator to find sin(4) * cosh(4) and rounding down to the nearest integer:\\n\\nsin(4) \u2248 -0.7568\\ncosh(4) \u2248 27.3082\\nsin(4) * cosh(4) \u2248 -0.7568 * 27.3082 \u2248 -20.6128\\n\\nRounding down, we get:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -21\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x)*sinh(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To calculate the indefinite integral of the function \\\\( f(x) = \\\\cos(x) \\\\cdot \\\\sinh(x) \\\\), we'll use integration by parts.
