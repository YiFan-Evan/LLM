Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x) * e^x.\\n   Solution: The integral of sinh(x) * e^x can be found using integration by parts. sinh(x) is actually (e^x - e^-x)/2, and when multiplied by e^x, it simplifies to (e^(2x) - 1)/2. The integral of e^(2x) is (1/2)e^(2x) and the integral of -1 is -x. Therefore, the indefinite integral of sinh(x) * e^x is (1/4)e^(2x) - x/2.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the definite integral of sinh(x) from 0 to \u03c0.\\n   Solution: The integral of sinh(x) is -cosh(x) + C.
