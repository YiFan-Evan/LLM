Let u = x^3, then du/dx = 3x^2, which implies dx = du/(3x^2). However, the integral of e^(x^3) does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, and it involves the error function (erf), which is not an elementary function. Therefore, we cannot provide a simple closed-form solution for this integral.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^x.\\n   - **Solution 2:** The integral of e^x is straightforward. It is the function itself with an added constant, since the derivative of e^x with respect to x is e^x. Thus, the indefinite integral of g(x) is \u222be^x dx = e^x + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = x * e^x.\\n   - **Solution 3:** For this integral, we use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^x dx. Then du = dx and v = e^x. Applying the integration by parts formula \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get \u222bx * e^x dx = x * e^x - \u222be^x dx = x * e^x - e^x + C = (x - 1)e^x + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^(x^2), then substitute 'x = 4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n- **Solution for the Original Problem:** The integral of e^(x^2) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions. It is related to the Gaussian integral, which is \u222be^(x^2) dx = \u221a\u03c0/2 * erf(x) + C, where erf(x) is the error function.
