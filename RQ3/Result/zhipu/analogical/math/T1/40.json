Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C, where C is the constant of integration. When we substitute 'x=0' into the result (as it's a related problem to the original request but with a different function), we get e^0 + C = 1 + C.
