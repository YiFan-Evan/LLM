Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function \\\\( e^x / (1 + e^x) \\\\).\\n   Solution: To integrate \\\\( e^x / (1 + e^x) \\\\), we can use a substitution where \\\\( u = 1 + e^x \\\\) which implies \\\\( du = e^x dx \\\\). The integral becomes \\\\( \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{u} du \\\\), which is simply \\\\( \\\\ln|u| + C \\\\). Substituting back, we get \\\\( \\\\ln|1 + e^x| + C \\\\).\\n\\n2.

Substituting back, we get \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln|1 + x^2| + C \\\\).\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function \\\\( \\\\frac{1+x}{\\\\sinh(x)} \\\\):\\n\\nTo integrate \\\\( \\\\frac{1+x}{\\\\sinh(x)} \\\\), we can split the integral into two parts: \\\\( \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sinh(x)} dx + \\\\int \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sinh(x)} dx \\\\).\\n\\nThe first integral, \\\\( \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sinh(x)} dx \\\\), can be rewritten as \\\\( \\\\int \\\\cosh(x) dx \\\\), because \\\\( \\\\cosh^2(x) - \\\\sinh^2(x) = 1 \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\cosh(x) \\\\) is the derivative of \\\\( \\\\sinh(x) \\\\). So, this part of the integral is \\\\( \\\\sinh(x) + C_1 \\\\).\\n\\nThe second integral, \\\\( \\\\int \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sinh(x)} dx \\\\), is more complex. One way to approach it is by using integration by parts. Let \\\\( u = x \\\\) and \\\\( dv = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sinh(x)} dx \\\\). Then \\\\( du = dx \\\\) and \\\\( v = \\\\ln(\\\\cosh(x)) \\\\) because \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx}[\\\\ln(\\\\cosh(x))] = \\\\frac{\\\\sinh(x)}{\\\\cosh(x)} = \\\\tanh(x) \\\\), and \\\\( \\\\tanh(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\sinh(x)}{\\\\cosh(x)} \\\\).\\n\\nUsing integration by parts, we have:\\n\\\\[ \\\\int x \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sinh(x)} dx = uv - \\\\int v du = x \\\\ln(\\\\cosh(x)) - \\\\int \\\\ln(\\\\cosh(x)) dx \\\\]\\n\\nThe integral of \\\\( \\\\ln(\\\\cosh(x)) \\\\) does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, but we can proceed without calculating it explicitly since we only need the value of the integral at \\\\( x = 4 \\\\).\\n\\nNow, substitute \\\\( x = 4 \\\\) into the result of the indefinite integral (excluding the constant \\\\( C \\\\)):\\n\\\\[ \\\\sinh(4) + 4 \\\\ln(\\\\cosh(4)) \\\\]\\n\\nTo find the integer result by rounding down, we need to calculate \\\\( \\\\sinh(4) \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\ln(\\\\cosh(4)) \\\\) and then perform the arithmetic.

We can express 1/sinh(x) as csch(x), which is the hyperbolic cosecant function. The integral of csch(x) is -ln|csch(x) + coth(x)| + C.\\n\\nFor the second part, \u222b(x/sinh(x)) dx, we would need to use integration by parts. However, since we are only interested in the final value at x = 4, we can avoid the actual integration by parts calculation.\\n\\nNow let's calculate the value of the indefinite integral at x = 4 and then round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\n\u222b(1+x)/sinh(x) dx from 0 to 4 = [-ln|csch(x) + coth(x)| + x*ln|csch(x) + coth(x)|] from 0 to 4\\n\\nSince csch(x) = 1/sinh(x) and coth(x) = cosh(x)/sinh(x), we can simplify the expression:\\n\\n\u222b(1+x)/sinh(x) dx from 0 to 4 = [-ln|1/sinh(x) + cosh(x)/sinh(x)| + x*ln|1/sinh(x) + cosh(x)/sinh(x)|] from 0 to 4\\n\\nNow, we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\\n\\n[-ln|1/sinh(4) + cosh(4)/sinh(4)| + 4*ln|1/sinh(4) + cosh(4)/sinh(4)|] - [-ln|1/sinh(0) + cosh(0)/sinh(0)| + 0*ln|1/sinh(0) + cosh(0)/sinh(0)|]\\n\\nWe know that sinh(0) = 0, which would make the denominator of the logarithm 0, and thus the natural logarithm undefined. However, since we're dealing with the limit as sinh(x) approaches 0 from the positive side, we can consider the limit of the expression as x approaches 0, which is 0. So the second term in the brackets evaluates to 0.\\n\\nNow we only need to calculate the first term with x = 4:\\n\\n-ln|1/sinh(4) + cosh(4)/sinh(4)| + 4*ln|1/sinh(4) + cosh(4)/sinh(4)|\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\n3*ln|1/sinh(4) + cosh(4)/sinh(4)|\\n\\nWe can simplify this further by noting that cosh^2(4) - sinh^2(4) = 1, which means cosh(4)/sinh(4) = sqrt(cosh^2(4)/sinh^2(4)) = sqrt(1 + sinh^2(4)/sinh^2(4)) = sqrt(1 + 1) = sqrt(2). Therefore, the expression inside the logarithm simplifies to:\\n\\n1/sinh(4) + sqrt(2)\\n\\nNow, to get the integer result by rounding down, we would need to calculate the numerical value of the expression and then round down. Since I cannot perform these calculations directly, you would use a calculator to find the numerical values and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The integer result after performing the above calculations and rounding down.]\""}]
