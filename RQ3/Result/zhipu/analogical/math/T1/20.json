However, since we are integrating from 0 to x, we will evaluate -cosh(x) at the limits of integration. This gives us -[cosh(x) - cosh(0)] which simplifies to -[cosh(x) - 1]. At x=0, cosh(0) is 1, so the definite integral from 0 to x is 1 - cosh(x).\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Find the indefinite integral of sinh(x) and then evaluate the result at x=2.\\n   - Solution: The indefinite integral of sinh(x) is -cosh(x) + C.
