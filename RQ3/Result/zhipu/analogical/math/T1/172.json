Problem 1: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1+x) with respect to x.\\n\\nDescription: This problem requires the basic integration of a polynomial function.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of (1+x) is found by integrating each term separately. The integral of 1 is x, and the integral of x is (1/2)x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1+x) is x + (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\n2. Problem 2: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x with respect to x.\\n\\nDescription: This problem involves integrating an exponential function, which is a straightforward process due to the derivative of e^x being e^x itself.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of e^x is simply e^x + C because the derivative of e^x is e^x.\\n\\n3.
