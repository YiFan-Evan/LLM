Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = cos(x)/sin(x).\\n   Solution: To integrate f(x) = cos(x)/sin(x), we use a substitution. Let u = sin(x), then du/dx = cos(x) which implies dx = du/cos(x). The integral becomes \u222b cos(x)/sin(x) dx = \u222b 1/u du = ln|u| + C = ln|sin(x)| + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = sin(x)/cos(x).\\n   Solution: To integrate g(x) = sin(x)/cos(x), which is the same as the derivative of tan(x), we use the fact that the integral of the derivative of a function is the function itself up to a constant. Thus, \u222b sin(x)/cos(x) dx = \u222b tan(x) dx = -ln|cos(x)| + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = sin(cos(x))/cos(x).\\n   Solution: This integral is more complex as it involves the composition of trigonometric functions. There is no simple elementary function for this integral, and it typically requires special functions or numerical methods. However, if we were to attempt an elementary solution, we would look for a substitution, but it's not straightforward in this case. This integral doesn't have a simple closed-form solution and would likely require numerical approximation.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the function cos(cos(x))/sin(x):\\n\\nTo find the indefinite integral of cos(cos(x))/sin(x), we can't directly integrate this function using elementary methods as it is not a standard integral form. It involves a composition of trigonometric functions that makes it non-trivial. Typically, this integral would be approached numerically or by using special functions if a closed-form solution is required.\\n\\nHowever, since we are not concerned with a closed-form solution but rather with the value of the integral at x=4, we would typically use numerical integration methods to approximate the value of the integral at x=4. Unfortunately, providing an exact integer result for this integral without using numerical methods is not feasible.\\n\\nTherefore, to solve the original problem as stated, we would need to use numerical integration techniques to find the value of the integral at x=4 and then round down to the nearest integer. This process cannot be represented here without computational tools.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [This question cannot be answered as stated without computational tools for numerical integration.]\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(cos(x))/sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function cos(cos(x))/sin(x), we first notice that this is not an elementary function that can be integrated using standard techniques.
