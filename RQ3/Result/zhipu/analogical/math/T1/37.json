Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of -cos(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of -cos(x) is -sin(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration. This is because the integral of cos(x) is sin(x), and the negative sign is carried through the integration.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x^2).\\n   Solution: This integral is not elementary and requires special techniques such as substitution or numerical methods. However, the indefinite integral of cos(x^2) with respect to x is given by (1/2) * sin(x^2) + C, using the substitution u = x^2, du = 2x dx, which simplifies the integral to (1/2) * sin(u) + C, and then substituting back x^2 for u.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x) from 0 to x.\\n   Solution: This is a definite integral, not an indefinite one. The solution is sin(x) - sin(0), which simplifies to sin(x), since sin(0) is 0.
