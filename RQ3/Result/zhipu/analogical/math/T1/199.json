Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x) * ln(x).\\n   Solution: To integrate sinh(x) * ln(x), we would use integration by parts. Let u = ln(x) and dv = sinh(x)dx. Then du = 1/x dx and v = cosh(x). Applying the integration by parts formula, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get:\\n   \u222bsinh(x) * ln(x) dx = ln(x) * cosh(x) - \u222bcosh(x) * 1/x dx. The integral of cosh(x)/x does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, so the solution would be left in this form.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of x * sinh(x)^2.\\n   Solution: For the integral of x * sinh(x)^2, we can use substitution. Let u = sinh(x) and dv = x dx. Then du = cosh(x) dx and v = x^2/2. Applying integration by parts, we have:\\n   \u222bx * sinh(x)^2 dx = x^2/2 * sinh(x) - \u222bx^2/2 * cosh(x) dx. This integral also does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, and the solution would typically be left in this form.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x)^2.\\n   Solution: The integral of sinh(x)^2 can be calculated using the identity sinh(x)^2 = (1/2)(cosh(2x) - 1). Thus, the integral becomes:\\n   \u222bsinh(x)^2 dx = \u222b(1/2)(cosh(2x) - 1) dx = (1/2)\u222bcosh(2x) dx - (1/2)\u222bdx. The integral of cosh(2x) is (1/2)sinh(2x), and the integral of dx is x. Thus, we have:\\n   (1/2)(1/2)sinh(2x) - (1/2)x = (1/4)sinh(2x) - (1/2)x + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x)^2 * ln(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The integral of sinh(x)^2 * ln(x) does not have a simple antiderivative that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions.
