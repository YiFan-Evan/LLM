Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x * e^x.\\n   Solution: This integral requires integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = dx and v = e^x. Using the formula for integration by parts, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get \u222bx * e^x dx = x * e^x - \u222be^x dx = x * e^x - e^x + C.\\n\\n3.

Let u = sin(x) and dv = e^x dx for the first iteration. After applying integration by parts twice, we get \u222bsin(x) * e^x dx = sin(x) * e^x - cos(x) * e^x + \u222bcos(x) * e^x dx.

To find the indefinite integral of this function, we use the substitution method, where we let u = x^2. Then, du = 2x dx, and dx = du / (2x).

The integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222be^x^2 dx = \u222be^u (du/2) = (1/2) \u222be^u du = (1/2) e^u + C = (1/2) e^(x^2) + C.\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n(1/2) e^(4^2) + C = (1/2) e^16 + C.\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down and we are not including the constant C, we only consider the part (1/2) e^16.
