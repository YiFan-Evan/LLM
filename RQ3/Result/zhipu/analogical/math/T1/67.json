Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = cos(x) and then evaluate the integral from 0 to \u03c0.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of cos(x) is sin(x) + C. Evaluating from 0 to \u03c0 gives us sin(\u03c0) - sin(0), which simplifies to 0 - 0 = 0.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 2cos(x) and then find the value of the integral at x = \u03c0/2.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of 2cos(x) is 2sin(x) + C. Substituting x = \u03c0/2 into the integral gives us 2sin(\u03c0/2) = 2 * 1 = 2.\\n\\n3. Problem: Given the function h(x) = cos(x) - sin(x), find the indefinite integral and then evaluate it at x = \u03c0.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of cos(x) - sin(x) is sin(x) + cos(x) + C.

Substituting x = 4 into the integral gives us sin(4) + C. Since we are asked for the integer result by rounding down, we ignore the constant C (as it will not affect the rounding down process) and round down sin(4). The value of sin(4) is approximately -0.7568, so rounding down gives us -1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Certainly! Let's follow the same format with three related problems involving the integral of the cosine function, and then solve the original problem.\\n\\n1. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = cos(x) and then evaluate it at x = \u03c0/6.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of cos(x) is sin(x) + C. Evaluating this at x = \u03c0/6 gives us sin(\u03c0/6) + C, which is 1/2 + C. Since we are not given a specific value for C, we cannot provide a numerical value, but we have the expression 1/2 + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = -cos(x) and then evaluate the integral at x = \u03c0.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of -cos(x) is -sin(x) + C. Evaluating this at x = \u03c0 gives us -sin(\u03c0) + C, which simplifies to 0 + C. Again, without a specific value for C, we cannot provide a numerical result.\\n\\n3. Problem: Determine the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = cos(x) + 1 and then find the value of the integral at x = 0.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of cos(x) + 1 is sin(x) + x + C. Evaluating this at x = 0 gives us sin(0) + 0 + C, which is 0 + 0 + C, resulting in C. The value of the integral is simply the constant C, which again, without a specific value, cannot be numerically determined.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of cos(x) is sin(x) + C. Substituting x = 4 into the integral gives us sin(4) + C. To find the integer result by rounding down, we consider only the value of sin(4), which is approximately -0.7568.
