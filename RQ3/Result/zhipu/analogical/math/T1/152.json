Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x/(ln(x)).\\n\\n   Description: This problem involves integrating a function that has the natural logarithm in the denominator and an x in the numerator, which is the reciprocal of the original function provided.\\n\\n   Solution: The integral of x/ln(x) is not straightforward and does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. It requires special functions or numerical methods to solve, and therefore it cannot be expressed in terms of basic functions and cannot be evaluated at a specific point without further techniques.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 1/(x*ln(x)).\\n\\n   Description: This problem is a variation where the function is the reciprocal of the original function provided but without the natural logarithm in the denominator. This is a common integral that can be solved using u-substitution.\\n\\n   Solution: By setting u = ln(x), du = 1/x dx, the integral becomes \u222b 1/u du = ln|u| + C.

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = 2ln(x)/(1/x).\\n\\n   Description: In this problem, the original function is multiplied by a constant (2) and then integrated. This requires the constant to be multiplied by the result of the integral of the original function.\\n\\n   Solution: The integral of 2ln(x)/(1/x) is 2 times the integral of ln(x)/(1/x).

Let u = ln(x) and dv = dx/x, then du = 1/x dx and v = ln(x). Integration by parts gives us:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) dx/x = uv - \u222b v du\\n= x*ln(x) - \u222b ln(x) dx\\n= x*ln(x) - \u222b 1 dx\\n= x*ln(x) - x + C\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n4*ln(4) - 4 + C\\n\\nSince we're asked to round down to the nearest integer, we don't need to calculate C. We only need to evaluate 4*ln(4) - 4:\\n\\n4*ln(4) \u2248 4*1.38629436112 \u2248 5.54517094448\\n5.54517094448 - 4 \u2248 1.54517094448\\n\\nRounding down gives us the integer 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(x)/(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = ln(x)/(1/x), we can rewrite the function as x * ln(x) because (1/x) * x = 1.
