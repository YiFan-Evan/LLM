Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x * cos(x).\\n\\n   Solution: To integrate e^x * cos(x), we can use integration by parts. Let u = e^x and dv = cos(x)dx.

This integral is a special function and cannot be expressed in terms of basic functions like polynomials, exponentials, or trigonometric functions. Therefore, we would typically use numerical methods or software to approximate this integral.\\n\\nHowever, for the purpose of this problem, let's assume we can evaluate this integral numerically.
