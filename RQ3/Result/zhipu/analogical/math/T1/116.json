The area under the curve is 2\u03c0, which is the same as the length of the interval because the average value of cos(x) over a full period is 0.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function (1 + cos(x)), substitute 'x = 4' into the result, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of 1 + cos(x), as found in Problem 1, is x + sin(x) + C. Substituting x = 4 gives us:\\n4 + sin(4) + C.\\n\\nTo find the integer result, we ignore the constant C (since it's unknown and would cancel out in a definite integral) and round down sin(4). The sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, and sin(4) is a value between 0 and 1 (since 4 radians is between 0 and \u03c0/2). Therefore, when we round down sin(4), we get 0.\\n\\nThus, the final expression is 4 + 0, which is simply 4.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+cos(x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the original problem, we'll follow these steps:\\n\\n1.
