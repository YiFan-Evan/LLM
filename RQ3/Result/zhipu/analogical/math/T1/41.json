Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x)*(1+x).\\n   Solution: To integrate cos(x)*(1+x), we use the sum rule for integration, which allows us to integrate each term separately. The integral of cos(x) is sin(x), and the integral of (1+x) is x + 1/2 x^2. Thus, the indefinite integral of cos(x)*(1+x) is sin(x) + x + 1/2 x^2 + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x)*(2-x).\\n   Solution: Integrating sin(x)*(2-x) requires applying the sum rule for integration again. The integral of sin(x) is -cos(x), and the integral of (2-x) is 2x - 1/2 x^2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of sin(x)*(2-x) is -cos(x) + 2x - 1/2 x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function tan(x)*(1+x).\\n   Solution: Integrating tan(x)*(1+x) is more complex because the integral of tan(x) is not straightforward; it is -ln|cos(x)| + C. The integral of (1+x) remains x + 1/2 x^2. So, the indefinite integral of tan(x)*(1+x) is -ln|cos(x)| + x + 1/2 x^2 + C.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x)*(1+x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: To integrate sin(x)*(1+x), we use the sum rule for integration.
