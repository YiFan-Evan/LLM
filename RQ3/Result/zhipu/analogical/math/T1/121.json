Since the derivative of the natural logarithm function is the original function f(x) = 1/x, this confirms that our antiderivative from Problem 1 is correct.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution to the Original Problem**: The indefinite integral of (1/x) is ln|x| + C. Substituting 'x=4' gives us ln|4| + C. Since we are not given a value for C, we can ignore it for the purposes of substitution because it will be the same for both the integral and its evaluation at x=4. Therefore, we have ln(4). The numerical value of ln(4) is approximately 1.386294. Rounding down to the nearest integer, we get 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To address the original problem with the function (1/x), we will follow the steps outlined:\\n\\n1.
