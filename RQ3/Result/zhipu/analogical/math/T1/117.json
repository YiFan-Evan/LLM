However, an antiderivative can be found using integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = sin(x)dx, then du = dx and v = -cos(x). Using the formula for integration by parts, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get:\\n     \u222b sin(x)*x dx = -x*cos(x) + \u222b cos(x) dx = -x*cos(x) + sin(x) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:**\\n   - **Description:** Find the indefinite integral of the function e^x*x^2.\\n   - **Solution:** This integral also requires integration by parts multiple times or recognition of a pattern that leads to the exponential integral function. However, for simplicity, let's use integration by parts twice. Let u = x^2 and dv = e^x dx. Then du = 2x dx and v = e^x. The first integration by parts gives us:\\n     \u222b e^x*x^2 dx = x^2*e^x - \u222b 2x*e^x dx.\\n   Now we perform integration by parts again on the integral \u222b 2x*e^x dx with u = 2x and dv = e^x dx. This gives us:\\n     \u222b 2x*e^x dx = 2x*e^x - \u222b 2*e^x dx = 2x*e^x - 2e^x + C.\\n   Substituting this back into our original equation, we get:\\n     \u222b e^x*x^2 dx = x^2*e^x - (2x*e^x - 2e^x) + C = (x^2 - 2x + 2)e^x + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:**\\n   - **Description:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (x^2)*ln(x).\\n   - **Solution:** This integral requires a special technique because it is not straightforward to integrate using standard methods. One approach is to use integration by parts where u = ln(x) and dv = x^2 dx. Then du = 1/x dx and v = (1/3)x^3. The integration by parts formula gives us:\\n     \u222b x^2*ln(x) dx = (1/3)x^3*ln(x) - \u222b (1/3)x^3*(1/x) dx = (1/3)x^3*ln(x) - (1/3)\u222b x^2 dx.\\n   The integral \u222b x^2 dx is simple: (1/3)x^3. Substituting this back, we get:\\n     \u222b x^2*ln(x) dx = (1/3)x^3*ln(x) - (1/9)x^3 + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\n- **Description:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x)*x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n- **Solution:** To integrate cos(x)*x, we use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = cos(x)dx. Then du = dx and v = sin(x). Using the integration by parts formula, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get:\\n  \u222b cos(x)*x dx = x*sin(x) - \u222b sin(x) dx = x*sin(x) + cos(x) + C.\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the result, we get:\\n  4*sin(4) + cos(4) + C.\\nTo provide the integer result by rounding down, we calculate the numerical value of the expression without the constant C and round down to the nearest integer. Assuming we are working in radians, the calculation would be approximately:\\n  4*sin(4) + cos(4) \u2248 4*(-0.7568) + (-0.6536) \u2248 -3.0272 - 0.6536 \u2248 -3.6808.\\nRounding down, we get the integer result of -4.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -4.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x)*x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function cos(x)*x, we will use integration by parts.
