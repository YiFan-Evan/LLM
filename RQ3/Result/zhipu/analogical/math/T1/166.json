Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x) * cos(cos(x)).\\n   Solution: To integrate cos(x) * cos(cos(x)), we use a substitution. Let u = cos(x), then du = -sin(x)dx, and dx = -du/sin(x). However, this substitution does not simplify the integral directly since we still have a trigonometric function of u inside the cosine. This integral does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions and would typically require numerical methods for evaluation.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x) * cos(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x) * cos(x) can be solved using a simple trigonometric identity. We can rewrite sin(x) * cos(x) as 1/2 * sin(2x). Integrating 1/2 * sin(2x) gives us -1/4 * cos(2x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin^2(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of sin^2(x) can be solved using the identity sin^2(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2.

This is because it is a composition of trigonometric functions, and unlike the previous examples, there's no straightforward trigonometric identity or substitution that simplifies the integral.\\n\\nTo find the numerical result, we would typically use numerical integration techniques or software tools.
