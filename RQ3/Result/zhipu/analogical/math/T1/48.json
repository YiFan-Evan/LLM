The integral becomes -\u222bu/e^x du. Since e^x is the derivative of e^x, we can integrate as -\u222bue^(-x) du. Using integration by parts with v = u and dw = e^(-x) dx, we get the integral of e^(-x) u - \u222be^(-x) du. This simplifies to -e^(-x) u + e^(-x) + C. Substituting back u = 1 - x gives us -e^(-x)(1 - x) + e^(-x) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Find the indefinite integral of the function (2 + x)/e^x.\\n   - **Solution 2:** Similar to the original function, we can integrate (2 + x)/e^x by parts. However, this time, we can split the integral into \u222b2/e^x dx + \u222bx/e^x dx. The first integral is straightforward and equals -2e^(-x) + C1. The second integral can be solved using integration by parts as described in Problem 1, which results in -e^(-x)(2 + x) + 2e^(-x) + C2. Combining these results, we get -e^(-x)(2 + x) + 2e^(-x) + C1 + C2, which simplifies to -e^(-x)(1 + x) + C, where C is the sum of the constants C1 and C2.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Calculate the value of the integral from 0 to 3 of the function (1 + x)/e^x.\\n   - **Solution 3:** To solve this definite integral, we first find the indefinite integral as described in the original problem. Once we have the indefinite integral, we can evaluate it at the limits of integration (0 and 3). The difference between the values at the upper and lower limits gives us the definite integral. This would involve more calculation and evaluation rather than just substitution.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1 + x)/e^x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution to Original Problem:** The indefinite integral of (1 + x)/e^x can be found by using integration by parts. Let's integrate:\\n\\n\u222b(1 + x)/e^x dx = \u222be^(-x) dx + \u222bxe^(-x) dx\\n\\nThe first integral is simple: \u222be^(-x) dx = -e^(-x) + C1.\\n\\nFor the second integral, we use integration by parts with u = x and dv = e^(-x) dx.

Integration by parts gives us:\\n\\n\u222bxe^(-x) dx = -xe^(-x) - \u222b-e^(-x) dx = -xe^(-x) + e^(-x) + C2.\\n\\nCombining the two results, we get:\\n\\n\u222b(1 + x)/e^x dx = -e^(-x) + C1 - xe^(-x) + e^(-x) + C2 = -xe^(-x) + C, where C is the sum of C1 and C2.\\n\\nNow, substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral:\\n\\n-4e^(-4) + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to round down to the nearest integer, we can ignore the constant C (as it will not affect the rounding) and calculate the value of -4e^(-4). The value of e^(-4) is approximately 0.0183, and -4 times this value is approximately -0.0732.
