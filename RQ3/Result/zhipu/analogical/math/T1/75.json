Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x)/x.\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x)/x does not have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. However, it is known as the sine integral, denoted as Si(x). So, the indefinite integral would be Si(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x/x.\\n   Solution: Similar to the sine integral, the integral of e^x/x does not have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. It is known as the exponential integral, denoted as Ei(x). Thus, the indefinite integral would be Ei(x) + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of x^2/x.\\n   Solution: This integral simplifies easily by canceling out one of the x terms. The indefinite integral of x^2/x is the integral of x, which is (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nThe function is cos(x)/x. This is a well-known integral that also does not have a closed-form expression in terms of elementary functions. The integral of cos(x)/x is known as the cosine integral, denoted as Ci(x).

Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x)/x from x = 0 to x = \u03c0.\\n   Solution: This integral represents the sine integral from 0 to \u03c0, which would be Si(\u03c0) - Si(0). Since Si(0) = 0, the result is simply Si(\u03c0).\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the definite integral of e^(-x)/x from x = 0 to x = \u221e.\\n   Solution: This integral is related to the exponential integral function Ei(-x), and as x approaches infinity, the integral converges to -Ei(-0), which is a constant value.\\n\\n3.

Evaluating this at x = 4 gives us Ci(4) + C. Since we are only interested in the numerical result and instructed to round down to the nearest integer, we focus on the Ci(4) part.\\n\\nUsing numerical methods or software to approximate Ci(4), we might find that Ci(4) is approximately 0.57722.
