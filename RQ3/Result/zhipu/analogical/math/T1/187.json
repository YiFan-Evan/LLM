The integral becomes \u222b x * sinh(x^2) * x dx = 1/2 \u222b sinh(u) du. The integral of sinh(u) is cosh(u), so the indefinite integral of f(x) is 1/2 cosh(u) + C = 1/2 cosh(x^2) + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x^3 * cosh(x^3).\\n   - **Solution B**: For g(x) = x^3 * cosh(x^3), let v = x^3, so dv/dx = 3x^2, or dx = dv/(3x^2). The integral becomes \u222b x^2 * cosh(x^3) * x dx = 1/3 \u222b cosh(v) dv. The integral of cosh(v) is sinh(v), so the indefinite integral of g(x) is 1/3 sinh(v) + C = 1/3 sinh(x^3) + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Compute the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = e^x * sinh(e^x).\\n   - **Solution C**: For h(x) = e^x * sinh(e^x), we use the substitution w = e^x, so dw/dx = e^x, or dx = dw/w. The integral becomes \u222b sinh(w) dw/w = \u222b sinh(w) dw. The integral of sinh(w) is cosh(w), so the indefinite integral of h(x) is cosh(w) + C = cosh(e^x) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x^2^2*sinh(x^2), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n- **Solution**: The function given is f(x) = x^4*sinh(x^2). We use the substitution u = x^2, so du/dx = 2x, or dx = du/(2x). The integral becomes \u222b x^2*sinh(x^2) * 2x dx = \u222b u*sinh(u) du. The integral of u*sinh(u) can be found using integration by parts. Let's set v = sinh(u) so that dv = cosh(u) du, and dw = u du so that w = u^2/2. Integration by parts gives us:\\n\\n  \u222b u*sinh(u) du = u*sinh(u) - \u222b sinh(u) du = u*sinh(u) - cosh(u) + C = x^2*sinh(x^2) - cosh(x^2) + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral gives us:\\n\\n  4^2*sinh(4^2) - cosh(4^2) + C = 16*sinh(16) - cosh(16) + C.\\n\\nTo find the integer result, we would calculate this expression with a calculator or computer and then round down to the nearest integer.
