Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x*cos(x) and then evaluate the result at x=\u03c0.\\n   Solution: The integral of e^x*cos(x) can be found using integration by parts twice or by recognizing the pattern that the integral of e^x times a trigonometric function results in a combination of e^x times the same trigonometric function and its derivative. The integral is (e^x*cos(x) + e^x*sin(x))/2. Evaluating this at x=\u03c0 gives (e^\u03c0*(-1) + e^\u03c0*0)/2 = -e^\u03c0/2.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function e^x*tan(x) and evaluate the result at x=0.\\n   Solution: Integrating e^x*tan(x) is more complex due to the presence of the tangent function. This integral does not have a simple closed-form solution involving elementary functions and would typically require special functions or numerical methods to approximate. However, evaluating at x=0, where tan(x)=0, the integral simplifies to 0 regardless of the complexity of the function.\\n\\n3. Problem: Compute the indefinite integral of the function e^x*sin(2x) and then substitute x=\u03c0/2 into the result.\\n   Solution: The integral of e^x*sin(2x) can be approached similarly to the first problem, using integration by parts or recognizing the pattern. The integral is (e^x*sin(2x) - 2e^x*cos(2x))/4. Substituting x=\u03c0/2 gives (e^(\u03c0/2)*1 - 2e^(\u03c0/2)*0)/4 = e^(\u03c0/2)/4.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of e^x*sin(x) can be found using integration by parts. Let's denote u = sin(x) and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = cos(x) dx and v = e^x. The integral is:\\n\\n\u222b e^x*sin(x) dx = uv - \u222b v du\\n                 = e^x*sin(x) - \u222b e^x*cos(x) dx\\n\\nTo integrate \u222b e^x*cos(x) dx, we can use integration by parts again, and it will result in the original integral. This leads to an equation where the integral of e^x*cos(x) is expressed in terms of the integral of e^x*sin(x). Solving this equation gives:\\n\\n\u222b e^x*sin(x) dx = e^x*sin(x) - e^x*cos(x) + C\\n\\nNow, substitute x=4 into the result:\\n\\ne^4*sin(4) - e^4*cos(4)\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we would calculate this expression using a calculator or numerical software, and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The integer result after performing the calculation and rounding down]\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x*sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of \\\\( e^x \\\\sin(x) \\\\), we can use integration by parts.
