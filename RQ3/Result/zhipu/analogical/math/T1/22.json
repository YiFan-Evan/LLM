Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x and then evaluate the expression at x=0.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C. When we evaluate this at x=0, we get e^0 + C, which simplifies to 1 + C. Since we are not given the value of C, we cannot provide a numerical answer, but the expression at x=0 is 1 + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of e^x and then substitute x=2 into the result.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C. Substituting x=2 gives us e^2 + C. Without the value of C, we cannot provide a numerical answer, but the expression with x=2 is e^2 + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x, then find the derivative of this integral, and finally evaluate it at x=1.\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C. The derivative of this integral is e^x, because the derivative of e^x with respect to x is e^x. Evaluating this at x=1 gives us e^1, which is simply e (approximately 2.71828).

Substituting x=4 gives us e^4 + C. To get the integer result by rounding down, we consider the value of e^4 without C (since the constant C will not affect the rounding). e^4 is approximately 54.598.
