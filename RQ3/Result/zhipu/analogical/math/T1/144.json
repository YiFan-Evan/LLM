However, this results in an integral that is not elementary. Instead, we recognize that \\\\( \\\\frac{e^x}{x} \\\\) is the derivative of \\\\( e^x \\\\cdot \\\\ln|x| \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\), where \\\\( \\\\ln|x| \\\\) is the antiderivative of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\).

To find the indefinite integral of this function, we can use the product rule of integration, which states that the integral of a product of two functions is equal to the integral of one function times the other plus the integral of the derivative of the first function times the second function. However, in this case, it's simpler to recognize that \\\\( x \\\\cdot e^x \\\\) is the derivative of \\\\( e^x \\\\cdot x \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\), with no constant of integration needed because we are looking for an antiderivative.\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of \\\\( x \\\\cdot e^x \\\\) is \\\\( e^x \\\\cdot x - e^x + C \\\\), but since we need to substitute \\\\( x = 4 \\\\) into the antiderivative before we add \\\\( C \\\\), we can ignore the constant \\\\( C \\\\) for now.\\n\\nSubstituting \\\\( x = 4 \\\\) into \\\\( e^x \\\\cdot x - e^x \\\\) gives us:\\n\\n\\\\( e^4 \\\\cdot 4 - e^4 = 4e^4 - e^4 = 3e^4 \\\\)\\n\\nTo get the integer result by rounding down, we evaluate \\\\( 3e^4 \\\\) and round down to the nearest integer.
