What is the integer part of the result when x = 1?\\n\\n   **Solution 2**: This integral also requires integration by parts, and it must be done twice because we have x^2. The first step is to treat x^2 as u and sinh(x)dx as dv. After the first integration by parts, we will need to perform another integration by parts on the remaining integral. The result will be a combination of x*sinh(x), x*cosh(x), and sinh(x) terms, plus the constant C. After evaluating at x = 1 and ignoring the constant C, we would round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Determine the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = sinh(x)/x. What is the value of this integral when x = 3?\\n\\n   **Solution 3**: This integral does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, and it involves the Si function (sin integral), which is a special function. However, for the purpose of this problem, we would not need to compute the exact integral but rather use numerical methods or software to find an approximate value at x = 3.
