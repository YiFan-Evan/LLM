To solve this, we can use the trigonometric identity `sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x)`, which implies that `sin(x)cos(x) = 1/2sin(2x)`. The integral of `sin(2x)` is `-1/2 * cos(2x) + C`. Therefore, the integral of `sin(x) * cos(x)` is `-1/4 * cos(2x) + C`.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Find the indefinite integral of the function `g(x) = e^x * cos(x)`. This is a bit more complex and requires integration by parts twice. After applying integration by parts twice, you would end up with an equation that involves both `e^x * cos(x)` and `e^x * sin(x)`. The final result for the indefinite integral is `(e^x * sin(x) - e^x * cos(x))/2 + C`.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Compute the indefinite integral of the function `h(x) = tan(x) * sec^2(x)`. Since `tan(x) * sec^2(x)` is equivalent to the derivative of `tan(x)` (because `(tan(x))' = sec^2(x)`), the integral of `tan(x) * sec^2(x)` is simply `tan(x) + C`.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nThe original function is `f(x) = sinh(x) * cos(x)`. To integrate this, we recognize that `sinh(x)` is the hyperbolic sine function, and while it doesn't have a direct trigonometric identity like `sin(x) * cos(x)`, we can still integrate it using integration by parts. \\n\\nLet's use integration by parts with `u = sinh(x)` and `dv = cos(x) dx`. Then, `du = cosh(x) dx` and `v = sin(x)`. The integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b `sinh(x) * cos(x) dx` = `sinh(x) * sin(x) - \u222b cos(x) * cosh(x) dx`\\n\\nNow, we can use integration by parts again for the remaining integral with `u = cosh(x)` and `dv = cos(x) dx`, which gives us `du = sinh(x) dx` and `v = sin(x)`. So, we get:\\n\\n\u222b `cos(x) * cosh(x) dx` = `cosh(x) * sin(x) - \u222b sin(x) * sinh(x) dx`\\n\\nSubstituting this back into our original equation, we find that the two integrals involving `sinh(x) * cos(x)` cancel each other out, leaving us with:\\n\\n\u222b `sinh(x) * cos(x) dx` = `sinh(x) * sin(x) - cosh(x) * sin(x) + C`\\n\\nNow, let's substitute `x = 4` into the result:\\n\\n`sinh(4) * sin(4) - cosh(4) * sin(4)`\\n\\nSince we are asked for the integer result by rounding down, we would need to calculate `sinh(4)`, `sin(4)`, and `cosh(4)` and then find the integer part of the expression.

However, in this case, we can use a clever substitution involving hyperbolic functions.\\n\\nFirst, recall the definitions of the hyperbolic sine and cosine functions:\\n- `sinh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/2`\\n- `cosh(x) = (e^x + e^(-x))/2`\\n\\nThe product `sinh(x) * cos(x)` can be rewritten using these definitions:\\n`sinh(x) * cos(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/2 * cos(x)`\\n\\nNow, let's integrate this expression. We can split the integral into two parts:\\n\u222b `sinh(x) * cos(x) dx` = \u222b `(e^x/2 * cos(x)) dx` - \u222b `(e^(-x)/2 * cos(x)) dx`\\n\\nFor each of these integrals, we can use integration by parts.
