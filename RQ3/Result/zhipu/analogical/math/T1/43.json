The integral is (e^x*(-cos(x) + sin(x)))/2. Evaluating this at x = \u03c0 gives us (e^\u03c0*(-cos(\u03c0) + sin(\u03c0)))/2, which simplifies to (e^\u03c0*(1 + 0))/2 = e^\u03c0/2.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^x*tan(x) and then substitute x = 0 into the result.\\n\\n   *Solution*: Integrating e^x*tan(x) is more complex because tan(x) is not a simple function to integrate directly. However, using the substitution u = cos(x), du = -sin(x)dx, we can express tan(x) as sin(x)/cos(x) and rewrite the integral as -e^x*sin(x)/cos(x). This can be simplified further, but for the purpose of this problem, we just need the evaluation at x = 0. At x = 0, tan(0) = 0, and e^0 = 1, so the integral at x = 0 is 0.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Determine the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = e^x*e^(-x) and then evaluate the integral at x = 1.\\n\\n   *Solution*: The function e^x*e^(-x) simplifies to e^0, which is 1. The integral of a constant is the constant times x, so the indefinite integral of this function is x. Evaluating at x = 1 gives us the result 1.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x*cos(x), then substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n*Solution*: The integral of e^x*cos(x) can be found using integration by parts, where u = cos(x) and dv = e^x dx. This leads to an integral that alternates between sine and cosine, resulting in the integral (e^x*(sin(x) + cos(x)))/2. Substituting x = 4 into this expression gives us (e^4*(sin(4) + cos(4)))/2.
