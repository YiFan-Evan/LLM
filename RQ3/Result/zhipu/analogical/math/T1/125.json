Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x)cos(x).\\n   Solution: To integrate sin(x)cos(x), we can use a trigonometric identity or a substitution. Using the identity sin(2x) = 2sin(x)cos(x), we can rewrite the integral as 1/2 the integral of sin(2x), which is -1/4 cos(2x) + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x^2).\\n   Solution: This integral does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. However, using a substitution such as u = x^2 and du = 2x dx, we can express the integral as the integral of cos(u) / 2. This gives us (1/2)sin(u) + C, which, when substituting back for u, becomes (1/2)sin(x^2) + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(tan(x)).\\n   Solution: This integral is similar to the original problem but involves a different trigonometric function. Using a substitution like u = tan(x), we have du = sec^2(x) dx. The integral then becomes the integral of sin(u) / cos^2(x), which simplifies to the integral of sin(u) du because cos^2(x) = 1 + tan^2(x) = 1 + u^2. The integral of sin(u) is -cos(u) + C, which, when substituting back for u, gives us -cos(tan(x)) + C.\\n\\nNow, let's address the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(cos(x)), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The integral of sin(cos(x)) with respect to x is not straightforward and does not have a simple elementary form. However, we can use a substitution to solve it. Let's substitute u = cos(x), so du = -sin(x) dx. This changes the integral to the integral of -sin(u) du, which is cos(u) + C. Substituting back for u gives us cos(cos(x)) + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral result cos(cos(x)) + C gives us cos(cos(4)) + C. Since we're only interested in the integer part by rounding down and C is an arbitrary constant, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer result.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: \u230acos(cos(4))\u230b\\n\\nPlease note that without a calculator, we cannot determine the exact value of cos(cos(4)), but this is the process to find the integer result by rounding down.
