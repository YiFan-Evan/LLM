However, this is not the function we're given, so the actual solution isn't required here. Nevertheless, the general approach would be to let u = ln(x) and dv = e^x dx, then find du = 1/x dx and v = e^x. Using the integration by parts formula \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we would continue from there.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function ln(x)/x.\\n\\n   - **Solution B**: The integral of ln(x)/x can be found using integration by parts. Let u = ln(x) and dv = 1/x dx, then du = 1/x dx and v = ln(x). The integral \u222bln(x)/x dx = ln(x) * ln(x) - \u222bln(x) * (1/x) dx, which simplifies to (1/2) * ln^2(x) + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x.\\n\\n   - **Solution C**: This is a straightforward integral. The integral of e^x is simply e^x + C, because the derivative of e^x with respect to x is e^x.\\n\\nNow, let's address the original problem, which is to calculate the indefinite integral of the function ln(x)/e^x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\n- **Original Problem**: \u222b(ln(x)/e^x) dx, then substitute x=4.\\n\\n- **Solution**: To integrate ln(x)/e^x, we can use a substitution method. Let u = ln(x), then e^u = x, and du = 1/x dx, or dx = x du = e^u du. Substituting into the integral, we get:\\n\\n  \u222b(ln(x)/e^x) dx = \u222bu * e^(-u) du\\n\\n  This can be integrated using integration by parts or recognized as a standard integral involving the exponential function and the\u4f3d\u739b function (or by recognizing it as a form of the error function). However, the actual antiderivative is not simple and involves special functions, which are beyond the scope of basic calculus. For the sake of this problem, we will assume that we have found the antiderivative and it is some function F(x).\\n\\n  Then we would evaluate F(4), and round down to the nearest integer to get the final answer.\\n\\nSince the actual antiderivative of ln(x)/e^x involves special functions and cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, we cannot directly provide the integer result without further information or approximation. However, if we were to provide the answer as if we had calculated it, it would look like this:\\n\\n- **Therefore, the final answer is**: [The integer result after evaluating F(4) and rounding down]\\n\\nWithout the exact antiderivative or an approximation method, we cannot provide a numerical value for the final answer.
