Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^ln(cos(x)).\\n   Solution: Since e^ln(cos(x)) simplifies to cos(x), the integral of cos(x) with respect to x is sin(x) + C. When we substitute x=0 into sin(x), we get sin(0) = 0. Therefore, the final answer is: 0.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^ln(tan(x)).\\n   Solution: As e^ln(tan(x)) simplifies to tan(x), the integral of tan(x) with respect to x is -ln(|cos(x)|) + C. Substituting x=\u03c0/4 into -ln(|cos(x)|) gives us -ln(|cos(\u03c0/4)|) = -ln(\u221a2/2) \u2248 -0.3567. Since we are asked for an integer result, we round down to get -1. Therefore, the final answer is: -1.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^ln(e^x).\\n   Solution: This simplifies to e^x, and the integral of e^x with respect to x is e^x + C. Substituting x=1 into e^x gives us e^1 = e \u2248 2.7183. Rounding down, we get 2.

The indefinite integral of sin(x) with respect to x is -cos(x) + C. Substituting x=4 into -cos(x) gives us -cos(4). The value of cos(4) is approximately -0.6536, so -cos(4) is approximately 0.6536.
