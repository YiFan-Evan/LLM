This gives us x + (1/3)x^3 + C, where C is the constant of integration. Evaluating this expression at x = 4 gives us 4 + (1/3)(4^3) + C = 4 + (1/3)(64) + C = 4 + 64/3 + C. Since we are not given a value for C, we cannot simplify this expression further without more information.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x + 1 and determine the value of the integral when x = -2.\\n\\n   **Solution 2**: The indefinite integral of g(x) = x + 1 is (1/2)x^2 + x + C. When we evaluate this at x = -2, we get (1/2)(-2)^2 + (-2) + C = (1/2)(4) - 2 + C = 2 - 2 + C = C. The value of the integral at x = -2 is simply the constant C, which without additional context cannot be determined numerically.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Compute the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = 1 + x, then substitute x = 3 into the result and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\n   **Solution 3**: The indefinite integral of h(x) = 1 + x is x + (1/2)x^2 + C. Substituting x = 3 gives us 3 + (1/2)(3^2) + C = 3 + (1/2)(9) + C = 3 + 4.5 + C. Rounding down to the nearest integer, we get 7 (since 7.5 rounded down is 7).\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of the function (1+x) is x + (1/2)x^2 + C. Substituting x = 4 into the result gives us 4 + (1/2)(4^2) + C = 4 + (1/2)(16) + C = 4 + 8 + C. Since we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we can ignore the constant C because it will not affect the rounding down process. Therefore, the expression simplifies to 4 + 8 = 12.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 12\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the original problem, which involves the function f(x) = 1 + x, we'll follow these steps:\\n\\n1.
