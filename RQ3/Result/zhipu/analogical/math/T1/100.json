Let u = 1+x, then du/dx = 1, and dx = du. The integral becomes \u222be^u du, which is simply e^u + C. Substituting back, we get e^(1+x) + C.

Substituting x=4 gives e^(1+4) + C = e^5 + C. Since we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down and we're ignoring the constant C, we only consider e^5.
