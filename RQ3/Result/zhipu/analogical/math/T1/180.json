Then, du = 1/x dx and v = e^x. The integration by parts formula is \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du. Applying this, we get:\\n   \u222b ln(x) * e^x dx = ln(x) * e^x - \u222b e^x * (1/x) dx. The integral \u222b e^x * (1/x) dx cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, so this is our final result.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x * ln(x).\\n   \\n   **Description:** This problem requires the use of a simple integration by parts, where we integrate a function of the form x times a logarithm.\\n   \\n   **Solution:** We use integration by parts with u = ln(x) and dv = x dx. This gives us du = 1/x dx and v = x^2/2. Applying the integration by parts formula, we get:\\n   \u222b x * ln(x) dx = (x^2/2) * ln(x) - \u222b (x^2/2) * (1/x) dx = (x^2/2) * ln(x) - \u222b x/2 dx = (x^2/2) * ln(x) - x^2/4 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:** Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = 1/(x * ln(x)).\\n   \\n   **Description:** This problem involves integrating a function with a singularity, and it requires a special function or a limiting process to evaluate the integral.\\n   \\n   **Solution:** This integral is a bit more complex as it does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. The integral \u222b 1/(x * ln(x)) dx is related to the logarithmic integral function Li(x), but since we are looking for an elementary solution, we might express it in terms of an infinite series or a special function, which is beyond the scope of basic calculus.
