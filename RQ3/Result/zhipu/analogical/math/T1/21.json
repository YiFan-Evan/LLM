When we multiply the function by a constant, the integral also gets multiplied by that constant. Therefore, the integral of 2e^x is 2e^x + C.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^(-x).\\n   - **Solution**: The integral of e^(-x) can be found by using the substitution method. Let u = -x, then du = -dx. The integral becomes the integral of e^u (-du), which simplifies to -e^u + C. Substituting back u = -x gives us -e^(-x) + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = x*e^x.\\n   - **Solution**: This integral requires integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^x dx. Then du = dx and v = e^x. Using the integration by parts formula, \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get x*e^x - \u222be^x dx = x*e^x - e^x + C = e^x(x - 1) + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^x, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n- **Solution**: The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C. Substituting x = 4 gives us e^4 + C. Since we're asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we only consider the numerical part of the expression without the constant C, which is e^4.
