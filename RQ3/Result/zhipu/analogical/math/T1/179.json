The function (1/(1/x))*sin(x) can be rewritten as x*sin(x) because 1/(1/x) is the reciprocal of 1/x, which is x.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the related problems:\\n\\n1. **Problem 1**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = x*cos(x).\\n   - **Solution**: This integral is solved using integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = cos(x) dx. Then du = dx and v = sin(x). The integral is:\\n     \u222b x*cos(x) dx = x*sin(x) - \u222b sin(x) dx\\n     The second integral is straightforward and results in -cos(x).

The first integration by parts gives:\\n     \u222b x^2*sin(x) dx = -x^2*cos(x) + \u222b 2x*cos(x) dx\\n     Now, for the second integration by parts, let u = 2x and dv = cos(x) dx.

It involves the sine integral function Si(x), defined as Si(x) = \u222b sin(t)/t dt from 0 to x.
