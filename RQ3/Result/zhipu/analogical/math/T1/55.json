Since we're looking for an integer, and ln|4| is not an integer, we would round down to 1 if we were to follow the same instructions, but note that natural logarithms do not yield integers when rounded down, so the result would be 0 in this context.\\n   - **Description B**: This problem introduces a rational expression with a higher degree in the denominator, requiring a different integration technique (the natural logarithm).\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = x^2/(x^2).\\n   - **Solution C**: Simplify the function to h(x) = 1, then integrate to get x + C. When x = 4, the expression becomes 4 + C. Since C is a constant, we cannot determine its value or the final integer result without additional information.
