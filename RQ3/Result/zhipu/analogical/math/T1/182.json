Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1 - cos(x))^2.\\n   Solution: First, expand the function to 1 - 2cos(x) + cos^2(x). The integral of 1 is x, the integral of -2cos(x) is -2sin(x), and the integral of cos^2(x) can be found using a substitution or by recognizing it as a sum of two integrals of cos(x) over the interval. Integrating cos^2(x) from 0 to x gives x/2 - sin(x)cos(x)/2. Therefore, the indefinite integral is x - 2sin(x) + x/2 - sin(x)cos(x)/2 + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x)(1 + cos(x))^2.\\n   Solution: This integral can be solved using substitution. Let u = 1 + cos(x), then du = -sin(x)dx, which means sin(x)dx = -du. The integral becomes -\u222b u^2 du, which is -(u^3/3) + C. Substituting back, we get -(1 + cos(x))^3/3 + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1 + cos(x))^3.\\n   Solution: This function is more complex and might require expanding the function using the binomial theorem or using reduction formulas. After expanding and integrating term by term, the result would be more complex than the first two problems, involving powers of cos(x) and their respective integrals. The final integral would include terms such as x, sin(x), and sin^2(x), among others, plus the constant C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1 + cos(x))^2, then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: First, expand the function to 1 + 2cos(x) + cos^2(x). The integral of 1 is x, the integral of 2cos(x) is 2sin(x), and as mentioned earlier, the integral of cos^2(x) from 0 to x gives x/2 - sin(x)cos(x)/2. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1 + cos(x))^2 is x + 2sin(x) + x/2 - sin(x)cos(x)/2 + C.\\n\\nNow, substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral:\\n4 + 2sin(4) + 4/2 - sin(4)cos(4)/2 + C\\n= 4 + 2sin(4) + 2 - (1/2)sin(8) + C\\n\\nWe are interested in the numerical result, so let's ignore the constant C for now. Evaluating the expression with x = 4 gives approximately:\\n4 + 2sin(4) + 2 - (1/2)sin(8)\\n\\nUsing a calculator to find sin(4) and sin(8), and then substituting these values into the expression, we get a numerical result.
