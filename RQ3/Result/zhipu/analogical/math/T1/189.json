Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function \\\\( f(x) = x^2 \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x) \\\\).\\n   Solution: To integrate \\\\( x^2 \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x) \\\\), we would use integration by parts twice. Let \\\\( u = x^2 \\\\) and \\\\( dv = \\\\sin(x)dx \\\\). Then, \\\\( du = 2xdx \\\\) and \\\\( v = -\\\\cos(x) \\\\). Applying integration by parts:\\n   \\\\[ \\\\int x^2 \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x)dx = -x^2 \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x) + \\\\int 2x \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x)dx \\\\]\\n   Now, we perform integration by parts again on the integral \\\\( \\\\int 2x \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x)dx \\\\), this time with \\\\( u = 2x \\\\) and \\\\( dv = \\\\cos(x)dx \\\\). Then, \\\\( du = 2dx \\\\) and \\\\( v = \\\\sin(x) \\\\). So,\\n   \\\\[ \\\\int 2x \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x)dx = 2x \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x) - \\\\int 2 \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x)dx \\\\]\\n   Finally, integrating \\\\( \\\\int 2 \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x)dx \\\\) gives us \\\\( -2 \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x) \\\\). Substituting back, we get:\\n   \\\\[ \\\\int x^2 \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x)dx = -x^2 \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x) + 2x \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x) + 2 \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x) + C \\\\]\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function \\\\( g(x) = (1+x) \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x) \\\\).\\n   Solution: We integrate \\\\( (1+x) \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x) \\\\) using integration by parts. Let \\\\( u = 1+x \\\\) and \\\\( dv = \\\\sin(x)dx \\\\). Then, \\\\( du = dx \\\\) and \\\\( v = -\\\\cos(x) \\\\). So,\\n   \\\\[ \\\\int (1+x) \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x)dx = -(1+x) \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x) + \\\\int \\\\cos(x)dx \\\\]\\n   The integral \\\\( \\\\int \\\\cos(x)dx \\\\) is straightforward, giving us \\\\( \\\\sin(x) \\\\). Therefore, the integral is:\\n   \\\\[ \\\\int (1+x) \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x)dx = -(1+x) \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x) + \\\\sin(x) + C \\\\]\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function \\\\( h(x) = x \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x) \\\\).\\n   Solution: This integral is simpler than the previous ones. We use integration by parts with \\\\( u = x \\\\) and \\\\( dv = \\\\sin(x)dx \\\\). Then, \\\\( du = dx \\\\) and \\\\( v = -\\\\cos(x) \\\\). Thus,\\n   \\\\[ \\\\int x \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x)dx = -x \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x) + \\\\int \\\\cos(x)dx \\\\]\\n   Integrating \\\\( \\\\int \\\\cos(x)dx \\\\) gives us \\\\( \\\\sin(x) \\\\). Therefore, the integral is:\\n   \\\\[ \\\\int x \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x)dx = -x \\\\cdot \\\\cos(x) + \\\\sin(x) + C \\\\]\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem with the function \\\\( f(x) = x \\\\cdot (1+x)/\\\\sin(x) \\\\):\\n\\nTo integrate \\\\( f(x) \\\\), we first simplify the integrand:\\n\\\\[ f(x) = \\\\frac{x(1+x)}{\\\\sin(x)} = \\\\frac{x + x^2}{\\\\sin(x)} \\\\]\\n\\nWe can split this into two separate integrals:\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{x + x^2}{\\\\sin(x)}dx = \\\\int \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sin(x)}dx + \\\\int \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\sin(x)}dx \\\\]\\n\\nThe first integral \\\\( \\\\int \\\\frac{x}{\\\\sin(x)}dx \\\\) can be approached using integration by parts, but the second integral \\\\( \\\\int \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\sin(x)}dx \\\\) is quite complex and does not have a simple elementary antiderivative.\\n\\nHowever, for the sake of this problem, we'll assume that we are able to find an antiderivative and then proceed to substitute \\\\( x = 4 \\\\) into the result. Let's assume the antiderivative of \\\\( f(x) \\\\) is \\\\( F(x) \\\\), so we would calculate \\\\( F(4) \\\\) and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nSince the actual integration and calculation of \\\\( F(4) \\\\) is beyond the scope of this explanation and would typically require numerical methods or software, we'll proceed directly to the final step assuming we have the antiderivative \\\\( F(x) \\\\).\\n\\nAfter calculating \\\\( F(4) \\\\), we would round down to the nearest integer to get the final answer.
