However, it can be expressed in terms of the Lambert W function, which is not typically an elementary function. The integral is x * e^(e^x) + C, where C is the constant of integration, and this solution is derived by using a substitution and the Lambert W function.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nThe function is f(x) = e^e^x. To find the indefinite integral of this function, we recognize that it does not have an elementary antiderivative, and it would usually require special functions like the Lambert W function, which is beyond the scope of basic integration techniques. However, we are asked to proceed as if we could integrate it and then evaluate it at x = 4.\\n\\nIf we were to integrate e^e^x with respect to x, assuming it were possible, we would get x * e^e^x + C. Now, we are asked to substitute x = 4 into this result and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4, we would have:\\n4 * e^e^4 + C\\n\\nSince we are not provided with a specific value for the constant C, and it will cancel out when we round down to the nearest integer, we focus on the term 4 * e^e^4.
