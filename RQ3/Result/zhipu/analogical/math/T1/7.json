Let u = x^2, then du/dx = 2x, so dx = du/(2x). The integral becomes \u222bln(u) * (du/(2x)). Since u = x^2, x = \u221au, and the 2x in the denominator and the dx in the numerator cancel out. The integral simplifies to 1/2 \u222bln(u) du. Using integration by parts, let v = ln(u) and dw = du. Then dv = 1/u du and w = u. The integral becomes uv - \u222bv dw, which is u*ln(u) - \u222bu * (1/u) du = u*ln(u) - u. Substituting back u = x^2, we get x^2*ln(x^2) - x^2/2. Simplifying, we have 2x*ln(x) - x^2/2.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 1/x.\\n   - **Solution B**: The function g(x) = 1/x is the derivative of ln|x|, so its indefinite integral is \u222b1/x dx = ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Compute the definite integral of the function h(x) = ln(x) from 1 to e.\\n   - **Solution C**: The definite integral of h(x) = ln(x) from 1 to e is \u222bln(x) dx from 1 to e. The antiderivative of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x + C. Applying the limits, we get [e*ln(e) - e] - [1*ln(1) - 1]. Since ln(e) = 1 and ln(1) = 0, the integral simplifies to [e - e] - [0 - 1] = 1.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function ln(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n- The indefinite integral of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x + C.\\n- Substituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral gives us 4*ln(4) - 4.\\n- Calculating this expression, we have 4*ln(4) - 4 \u2248 4*1.38629436112 - 4 \u2248 5.54516544848 - 4 \u2248 1.54516544848.\\n- Rounding down to the nearest integer, we get 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the original problem, we will follow these steps:\\n\\n1.
