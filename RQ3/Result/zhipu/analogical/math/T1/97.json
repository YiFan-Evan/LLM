Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function cos(x)*cosh(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of cos(x)*cosh(x) can be found using integration by parts. Let u = cos(x) and dv = cosh(x)dx. Then, du = -sin(x)dx and v = sinh(x). Using the integration by parts formula \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get:\\n   \u222bcos(x)*cosh(x)dx = cos(x)*sinh(x) - \u222b(-sin(x))*sinh(x)dx.\\n   The second integral can be solved similarly, resulting in an expression that contains both cos(x)*sinh(x) and sin(x)*cosh(x). After integrating sin(x)*cosh(x), we'll have the full expression for the integral.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x*sin(x).\\n   Solution: This integral can also be solved using integration by parts twice. Let u = sin(x) and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = cos(x)dx and v = e^x. After applying integration by parts once, we get:\\n   \u222be^x*sin(x)dx = e^x*sin(x) - \u222be^x*cos(x)dx.\\n   The second integral requires another application of integration by parts, which will yield the final expression for the integral.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function ln(x)*x.\\n   Solution: For this integral, we also use integration by parts. Let u = ln(x) and dv = x dx. Then, du = 1/x dx and v = x^2/2. Applying integration by parts gives:\\n   \u222bln(x)*x dx = ln(x)*x^2/2 - \u222bx^2/2 * (1/x) dx.\\n   Simplifying the second integral, we find the full expression for the integral.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x)*sinh(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The integral of sin(x)*sinh(x) can be found by recognizing that sin(x)*sinh(x) = (e^x - e^-x)/2 * sin(x). We can integrate term by term:\\n\u222bsin(x)*sinh(x)dx = \u222b(e^x/2*sin(x) - e^-x/2*sin(x))dx.\\nThis requires integration by parts for each term. Let's tackle the first term:\\n\u222be^x/2*sin(x)dx. Let u = sin(x) and dv = e^x/2 dx. Then, du = cos(x)dx and v = e^x/2. The integral becomes:\\n(e^x/2*sin(x) - \u222be^x/2*cos(x)dx). The second integral can be solved similarly.\\n\\nAfter calculating both integrals, we get an expression that involves e^x and e^-x, along with trigonometric functions. Substituting 'x=4' into this expression will give us a numerical result, which we then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nLet's do the actual calculation:\\n\\n\u222bsin(x)*sinh(x)dx = \u222b(e^x/2*sin(x) - e^-x/2*sin(x))dx\\n                   = (-e^x/2*cos(x) + e^-x/2*cos(x)) + C\\n                   = (-e^4/2*cos(4) + e^-4/2*cos(4)) + C.\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4:\\n(-e^4/2*cos(4) + e^-4/2*cos(4)).\\n\\nCalculating this numerical expression and rounding down gives us the final integer result. Since I can't calculate this directly, you would use a calculator to find the numerical value and then round down to get the integer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The integer result after performing the calculation and rounding down].

Therefore, the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x) * sinh(x) dx = \u222b sin(x) * ((e^x - e^-x)/2) dx\\n                        = 1/2 \u222b (e^x * sin(x) - e^-x * sin(x)) dx\\n\\nNow we will integrate each term separately. For the first term, we use integration by parts with u = sin(x) and dv = e^x dx. Then du = cos(x) dx and v = e^x. The integral of e^x * sin(x) becomes:\\n\\ne^x * sin(x) - \u222b e^x * cos(x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate the second term again by parts. Let's set u = cos(x) and dv = e^x dx.

We use integration by parts with u = sin(x) and dv = e^-x dx. Then du = cos(x) dx and v = -e^-x. The integral of -e^-x * sin(x) becomes:\\n\\n-e^-x * sin(x) - \u222b -e^-x * cos(x) dx\\n                = -e^-x * sin(x) + \u222b e^-x * cos(x) dx\\n\\nAgain, we perform integration by parts for the second integral, setting u = cos(x) and dv = e^-x dx.
