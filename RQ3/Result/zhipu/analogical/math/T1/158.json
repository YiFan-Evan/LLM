Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x^2).\\n   Solution: To find the integral of cos(x^2), we would typically use a substitution, but this integral does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. However, we can express it in terms of a special function, the Fresnel integral. The indefinite integral of cos(x^2) is (sqrt(\u03c0)/2) * S(x), where S(x) is the sine Fresnel integral. This is not an elementary function, so we cannot substitute a value for x and get a simple numerical answer.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of e^x sin(x).\\n   Solution: This integral can be solved using integration by parts twice. Let u = sin(x) and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = cos(x) dx and v = e^x. Integrating by parts, we get:\\n   \u222b e^x sin(x) dx = e^x sin(x) - \u222b e^x cos(x) dx.\\n   We then need to integrate \u222b e^x cos(x) dx using integration by parts again, which will lead to an expression involving both sin(x) and cos(x) multiplied by e^x. The final result will involve a combination of e^x sin(x) and e^x cos(x), along with a constant.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(e^x).\\n   Solution: To find the integral of sin(e^x), we can use a substitution method. Let u = e^x, then du = e^x dx, or dx = du/u. Substituting into the integral, we get:\\n   \u222b sin(e^x) dx = \u222b sin(u) (1/u) du.\\n   This integral is not straightforward because sin(u) does not have an elementary antiderivative when multiplied by 1/u. However, this is a transcendental integral that can be expressed in terms of special functions or numerical methods but not in terms of elementary functions.\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(e^x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution:\\nWe use the substitution u = e^x, du = e^x dx as described above. However, we cannot find a simple closed-form expression for the antiderivative of sin(e^x). Instead, we would typically use numerical integration methods to approximate the value of the definite integral from a specific lower limit (often 0) to x=4.\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide only the integer result by rounding down, we would use a calculator or computer software to numerically integrate sin(e^x) from 0 to 4 and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [This would be a number calculated by a numerical integration method, which I cannot provide without actual computation.
