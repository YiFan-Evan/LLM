The integral becomes (1/2) * ln|x^2 + 1| + C, since the derivative of x^2 + 1 with respect to x is 2x, and we have x dx as the original integrand.\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem with the function (1/x):\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution**: The indefinite integral of 1/x, as we've seen in Problem 1, is ln|x| + C. Substituting x = 4 into this result gives us ln(4) + C. Since we're asked to provide the integer result by rounding down and we're not given the value of C, we'll ignore it as it will not affect the integer part of our result. The natural logarithm of 4 is approximately 1.386294, so rounding down gives us 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the original problem with the function (1/x):\\n\\n**Original Problem**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution**: The indefinite integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration.
