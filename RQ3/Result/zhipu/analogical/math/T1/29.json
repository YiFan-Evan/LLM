The integral of 2x with respect to x is x^2, and the integral of 2 with respect to x is 2x. Thus, the indefinite integral is 2x^2 + 2x.\\n\\n**Problem 2:**\\nFind the indefinite integral of the function (1+x)^2.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nFirst, expand (1+x)^2 to get 1 + 2x + x^2. The integral of 1 with respect to x is x, the integral of 2x with respect to x is x^2, and the integral of x^2 with respect to x is (1/3)x^3. Therefore, the indefinite integral is x + x^2 + (1/3)x^3.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nCompute the indefinite integral of the function (1+x) and then evaluate the result at x=3.\\n\\n*Solution:*\\nThe integral of (1+x) with respect to x is x + (1/2)x^2. Substituting x=3 into this expression gives 3 + (1/2)(3^2) = 3 + (1/2)(9) = 3 + 4.5 = 7.5.

Substituting x=4 into this expression gives 4 + (1/2)(4^2) = 4 + (1/2)(16) = 4 + 32 = 36. Since we're asked for the integer result and 36 is already an integer, there is no need to round down. Therefore, the final answer is:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 36\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the original problem, we need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1+x), then evaluate the result at x=4, and finally provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n**Original Problem:**\\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function (1+x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n**Solution:**\\nThe indefinite integral of (1+x) with respect to x is found by integrating each term separately.
