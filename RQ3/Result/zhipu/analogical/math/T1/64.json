When we substitute x = 4 into the integral, we get -e^(-4) + C. Since we're not given a value for C and are asked to provide an integer result, we can't calculate an exact numerical value. However, we would round down the result of -e^(-4) to the nearest integer.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2:**\\n   - *Description:* Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = 1/(e^x).\\n   - *Solution:* The integral of 1/(e^x) is the same as the integral of e^(-x), which is -e^(-x) + C. Substituting x = 4 into the integral yields -e^(-4) + C. Again, without a specific value for C, we cannot determine the exact numerical value but would round down the result of -e^(-4) to the nearest integer.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3:**\\n   - *Description:* Determine the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = e^(-x) + 1.\\n   - *Solution:* The integral of e^(-x) + 1 is the integral of e^(-x) plus the integral of 1. The integral of e^(-x) is -e^(-x) + C1, and the integral of 1 is x + C2. Combining these, we have -e^(-x) + x + C, where C is the sum of C1 and C2. Substituting x = 4 gives us -e^(-4) + 4 + C. The value of C does not affect the integer part of the result when we round down, so we would round down -e^(-4) + 4 to the nearest integer.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\n- *Original Problem:* Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/e^x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\n- *Solution:* The indefinite integral of (1/e^x) is -e^(-x) + C. Substituting x = 4 into this integral gives us -e^(-4) + C.
