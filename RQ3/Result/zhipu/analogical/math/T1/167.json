The integral is given by:\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\sinh(x)}{1 + x} dx = \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\cosh(x)}{1 + x} dx \\\\]\\nThis is a non-trivial integral and does not have a simple closed form. However, if we proceed with integration by parts, we find that the integral is:\\n\\\\[ \\\\cosh(x) \\\\ln(1 + x) - \\\\int \\\\ln(1 + x) d(\\\\sinh(x)) \\\\]\\nThis expression can be simplified but does not lead to a simple elementary function.

The integral of 1 with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) is simply \\\\( x \\\\). However, since we have a division by zero at \\\\( x = 0 \\\\), we must exclude this point from the domain of integration.
