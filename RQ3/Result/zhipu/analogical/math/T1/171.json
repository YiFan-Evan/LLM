However, the roles of sine and cosine are reversed compared to the original function.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of cos(x)/sin(cos(x)) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions and requires special functions or numerical methods for evaluation. However, since the problem requires a similar structure, the solution process would involve recognizing the pattern and understanding that the integral does not have a simple closed-form expression.\\n\\n**Problem 3:**\\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = tan(x).\\n\\nDescription: This problem involves finding the integral of the tangent function, which is another standard integral in calculus.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of tan(x) is -ln|cos(x)| + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\nNow, let's address the original problem with the function f(x) = sin(x)/cos(sin(x)).\\n\\nTo find the indefinite integral of f(x), we need to use a substitution. Let's set u = sin(x), so du = cos(x)dx. However, the denominator is cos(sin(x)), which does not simplify the integral directly using this substitution.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the integral of sin(x)/cos(sin(x)) does not have a simple antiderivative in terms of elementary functions. This is because it is a transcendental function, and such integrals often require special functions or numerical methods for their evaluation.\\n\\nSince we cannot find an exact indefinite integral using elementary functions, we cannot proceed with substituting x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral and finding an integer result by rounding down. Therefore, we cannot provide a final integer answer as requested.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: N/A (the integral cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions).\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "sin(x)/cos(sin(x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To address the original problem, we need to find the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sin(x)/cos(sin(x)).
