The integral of 2x is x^2, and the integral of 2 is 2x. So the indefinite integral of 2(1+x) is x^2 + 2x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function (1+x)^2.\\n\\n   - **Description**: This problem involves finding the antiderivative of (1+x)^2, which expands to 1 + 2x + x^2.\\n   - **Solution**: Integrating each term separately, we get x + x^2/2 + x^3/3 + C. The indefinite integral of (1+x)^2 is thus x + x^2/2 + x^3/3 + C.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1+x) and then evaluate it at x=3.\\n\\n   - **Description**: The task is to integrate (1+x) with respect to x and then substitute x=3 into the resulting expression to find the specific value of the integral at that point.\\n   - **Solution**: The integral of (1+x) is x + x^2/2 + C. Substituting x=3 gives us 3 + 3^2/2 + C = 3 + 9/2 + C = 3 + 4.5 + C = 7.5 + C. Since we don't have the value of C, we cannot provide a specific number, but the expression at x=3 is 7.5 + C.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, we need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1+x), which is x + x^2/2 + C.
