The integration by parts method is typically used, where we select u = x and dv = cos(x)dx. This will lead to v = sin(x) and du = dx, and applying the integration by parts formula will give us the result.\\n\\n   **Solution**: Using integration by parts with u = x and dv = cos(x)dx, we get:\\n   \u222b x * cos(x) dx = x * sin(x) - \u222b sin(x) dx\\n   = x * sin(x) + cos(x) + C\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Find the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = e^x * x^2.\\n\\n   **Description**: This problem requires integrating a function that is a product of e^x and a polynomial. This can be done by another application of integration by parts, where we repeatedly apply the technique since the derivative of e^x is e^x itself, which does not simplify the polynomial part.\\n\\n   **Solution**: Using integration by parts with u = x^2 and dv = e^x dx, we get:\\n   \u222b e^x * x^2 dx = x^2 * e^x - \u222b 2x * e^x dx\\n   We need to apply integration by parts again to \u222b 2x * e^x dx:\\n   \u222b 2x * e^x dx = 2x * e^x - \u222b 2 * e^x dx\\n   = 2x * e^x - 2e^x + C\\n   Substituting this back, we get:\\n   \u222b e^x * x^2 dx = x^2 * e^x - (2x * e^x - 2e^x) + C\\n   = x^2 * e^x - 2x * e^x + 2e^x + C\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Compute the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = tan(x) * sec(x).\\n\\n   **Description**: This problem involves integrating a function that is a product of the tangent and secant of x. A useful trigonometric identity for this problem is that tan(x) * sec(x) = sin(x). This simplifies the integral to the integral of sin(x), which is a standard integral.\\n\\n   **Solution**: Using the identity tan(x) * sec(x) = sin(x), we get:\\n   \u222b tan(x) * sec(x) dx = \u222b sin(x) dx\\n   = -cos(x) + C\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, we need to calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x) * x, substitute x = 4 into the result, and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\n**Original Problem Solution**:\\nFirst, we integrate sinh(x) * x using integration by parts:\\nLet u = x and dv = sinh(x)dx.\\nThen, du = dx and v = cosh(x) (since the integral of sinh(x) is cosh(x)).\\n\\nUsing the integration by parts formula, we get:\\n\u222b sinh(x) * x dx = x * cosh(x) - \u222b cosh(x) dx\\n= x * cosh(x) - sinh(x) + C\\n\\nSubstitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral result:\\n4 * cosh(4) - sinh(4) + C\\n\\nSince we're asked to round down to the nearest integer and C is a constant that will cancel out when we subtract, we only need to consider the expression 4 * cosh(4) - sinh(4).\\n\\nUsing a calculator to find the numerical values of cosh(4) and sinh(4):\\ncosh(4) \u2248 27.30823\\nsinh(4) \u2248 27.28992\\n\\nNow, calculate 4 * cosh(4) - sinh(4):\\n4 * 27.30823 - 27.28992 \u2248 108.83292\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 108\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "sinh(x)*x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = sinh(x) * x, we will use integration by parts.
