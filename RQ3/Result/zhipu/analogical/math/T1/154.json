Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x) and then evaluate the result at x=\u03c0.\\n\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of sinh(x) is cosh(x) + C, where C is the constant of integration. Evaluating this at x=\u03c0 gives us cosh(\u03c0) + C. Since cosh(\u03c0) is a known transcendental number approximately equal to 3.6269, and without the value of C, we cannot provide an exact numerical value, but we would report the result as cosh(\u03c0) rounded down to the nearest integer, which is 3 (assuming C is such that the sum is still an integer when rounded down).\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the indefinite integral of the function 2sinh(x) and then evaluate the result when x=0.\\n\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of 2sinh(x) is 2cosh(x) + C. Evaluating this at x=0 gives us 2cosh(0) + C. Since cosh(0) = 1, the result is 2(1) + C = 2 + C. The integer part of this is 2 (assuming C is such that the sum is still an integer when rounded down), as cosh(0) is exactly 1 and doesn't require rounding.\\n\\n3. Problem: Compute the indefinite integral of x*sinh(x) and then substitute x=1 into the resulting expression.\\n\\n   Solution: The indefinite integral of x*sinh(x) is more complex and requires integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = sinh(x)dx. Then du = dx and v = cosh(x). Using integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n   \u222b x*sinh(x)dx = uv - \u222b v*du = x*cosh(x) - \u222b cosh(x)dx = x*cosh(x) - sinh(x) + C.\\n\\n   Evaluating this at x=1 gives us cosh(1) - sinh(1) + C. Since cosh(1) is approximately 1.5431 and sinh(1) is approximately 1.1752, their difference is approximately 0.368, and when considering C, the result can vary. However, the integer part of cosh(1) - sinh(1) (ignoring C) is 0 when rounded down.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of sinh(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of sinh(x) is cosh(x) + C. Substituting x=4 gives us cosh(4) + C. Since cosh(4) is a known transcendental number approximately equal to 27.3082, and without the value of C, we focus on the transcendental part. The integer part of cosh(4) when rounded down is 27.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 27\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "sinh(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the original problem, we first need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function sinh(x).
