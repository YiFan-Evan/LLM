Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function sin(x)/(1+x).\\n\\n   Description: This problem involves integrating a trigonometric function divided by a linear term. The integral of sin(x) is -cos(x), but the presence of the (1+x) in the denominator complicates the integral.\\n\\n   Solution: The integral of sin(x)/(1+x) with respect to x is not straightforward and does not have a simple elementary antiderivative.

Therefore, the function simplifies to 1/(1+x). The indefinite integral of 1/(1+x) with respect to x is ln|1+x| + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\nSubstituting x=4 into the indefinite integral, we get:\\n\\nln|1+4| = ln(5)\\n\\nTo get the integer result by rounding down, we need to evaluate the natural logarithm of 5 and round down to the nearest integer.
