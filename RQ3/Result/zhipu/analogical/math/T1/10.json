Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = ln(x^2).\\n   Solution: To integrate ln(x^2), we use the substitution u = x^2, which gives du/dx = 2x, or dx = du/(2x). The integral becomes \u222b ln(u) du/(2x). Since u = x^2, we can replace x with \u221au. The integral now is (1/2)\u222b ln(u) du. The integral of ln(u) is u*ln(u) - u + C, where C is the constant of integration. Substituting back, we get (1/2)[u*ln(u) - u] + C = (1/2)[x^2*ln(x^2) - x^2] + C.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = x*ln(x).\\n   Solution: This integral can be solved using integration by parts. Let u = ln(x) and dv = x dx. Then, du = 1/x dx and v = (1/2)x^2. Using the formula for integration by parts, \u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du, we get \u222b x*ln(x) dx = (1/2)x^2*ln(x) - \u222b (1/2)x^2*(1/x) dx = (1/2)x^2*ln(x) - (1/2)\u222b x dx = (1/2)x^2*ln(x) - (1/4)x^2 + C.\\n\\n3. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function h(x) = 1/x.\\n   Solution: The integral of 1/x is the natural logarithm function, so \u222b 1/x dx = ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration. The absolute value is used because the natural logarithm is defined only for positive values of x.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nOriginal Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = ln(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nSolution: The indefinite integral of ln(x) is x*ln(x) - x + C. Substituting x=4 into this expression gives us 4*ln(4) - 4 + C. To get the integer result, we don't need to worry about the constant C because it will cancel out when rounding. Calculating 4*ln(4) - 4 gives us approximately 4*1.38629436112 - 4 = 5.54517084448 - 4 = 1.54517084448. Rounding down to the nearest integer, we get 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "ln(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the original problem, we need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = ln(x), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down.\\n\\nHere are three related problems:\\n\\n1.
