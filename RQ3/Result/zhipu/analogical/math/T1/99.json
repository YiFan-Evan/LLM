Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)sin(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of (1/x)sin(x) can be found using integration by parts. Let u = sin(x) and dv = (1/x)dx. Then, du = cos(x)dx and v = ln|x| (since the integral of 1/x is ln|x|). Applying integration by parts, we get:\\n   \u222b (1/x)sin(x)dx = u * v - \u222b v * du\\n   = sin(x)ln|x| - \u222b ln|x|cos(x)dx\\n   This integral is not elementary and would typically require a numerical method or a special function to solve further.\\n\\n2. Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function x/cos(x).\\n   Solution: The integral of x/cos(x) is more complex and does not have a simple elementary form. It typically requires special functions or numerical methods to find an exact solution. One approach could be to use integration by parts, but this would lead to an equation that is not easily solvable.\\n\\n3.

This integral does not have a simple closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions and typically requires the use of special functions, such as the integral representation of the secant function or numerical methods.\\n\\nHowever, since we are asked to provide an integer result by rounding down after substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral, we would typically use numerical integration to approximate the value of the integral at x=4. Since I cannot perform numerical integration here, I'll describe how you would proceed:\\n\\n1. Use numerical integration (e.g., a calculator or computer software) to approximate \u222b (sec(x)/x)dx from 0 to 4.\\n2. Substitute x=4 into the numerical result of the integral.\\n3. Round down the result to the nearest integer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The integer result from the numerical integration of \u222b (sec(x)/x)dx from 0 to 4, rounded down.]\\n\\nPlease note that without the actual numerical computation, I cannot provide the exact integer result.
