Problem: Starting from the sock, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then 6 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you would calculate the net movement: (8 - 10 + 6) = 4 steps clockwise from the sock. Counting 4 steps clockwise from the sock, you would find the Schooner.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the water buffalo, you move around the ring by 12 steps in a clockwise direction, 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Here, the net movement is (12 - 14 + 8) = 6 steps clockwise from the water buffalo. Counting 6 steps from the water buffalo in a clockwise direction, you would find the Jack-o'-lantern.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the computer mouse, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction, 11 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: The net movement in this case would be (9 - 11 + 3) = 1 step counter-clockwise from the computer mouse. Counting 1 step counter-clockwise from the computer mouse, you would find the Toy Store.\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the minibus, you move 11 steps clockwise, 17 steps counter-clockwise, 4 steps clockwise, and 5 steps counter-clockwise. The net movement is (11 - 17 + 4 - 5) = -7 steps, which is the same as 7 steps counter-clockwise from the minibus.
