Problem: Starting from the spoonbill, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: The items are in a sequence, so you count the steps. Starting from the spoonbill and moving clockwise, you would pass the water tower, lemon, guinea pig, and reach the Boston Terrier. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from there, you would pass the African rock python and stop at the plow. Then, moving 2 steps clockwise, you would find the safety pin.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you start at the cheeseburger and move 7 steps clockwise, then 4 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 1 step clockwise again, what item will you end up on?\\n   Solution: Starting from the cheeseburger and moving 7 steps clockwise, you would pass the axolotl, chain-link fence, jaguar, tailed frog, jacamar, Malinois, and stop at the sarong. Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise, you would pass the sarong, Malinois, jacamar, and stop at the tailed frog. Then, moving 1 step clockwise, you would find the jaguar.\\n\\n3. Problem: From the position of the lemon, you take 4 steps clockwise, 6 steps counter-clockwise, and then 3 more steps clockwise. What item do you land on?\\n   Solution: From the lemon, moving 4 steps clockwise, you would pass the guinea pig and stop at the Boston Terrier. Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from there, you would pass the African rock python, plow, safety pin, projectile, spoonbill, and stop at the water tower. Then, moving 3 steps clockwise, you would find the cheeseburger.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the African rock python, you move 18 steps clockwise, which lands you on the sarong.
