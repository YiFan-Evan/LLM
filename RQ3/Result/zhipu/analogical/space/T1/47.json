Problem: Starting from the grey wolf, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: You move from the grey wolf to the doormat, then to the custard apple, the library, the dung beetle, and finally to the station wagon. Therefore, the item you find is the station wagon.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the Gila monster, you take 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you end up at?\\n   Solution: Moving counter-clockwise from the Gila monster, you pass the grey fox, the salt shaker, the grey wolf, the doormat, and the custard apple, which makes 5 steps. Then you continue past the library, which is the 6th step, and finally reach the dung beetle, which is the 7th step. Therefore, the item you find is the dung beetle.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the library, you move around the circle by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What item will you find?\\n   Solution: From the library, moving clockwise you pass the dung beetle, then the station wagon, and end at the CD player, which is the 3rd step.
