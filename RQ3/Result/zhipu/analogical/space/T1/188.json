Then, you move around the ring by 12 additional steps in a clockwise direction. Since you've already moved 8 steps from the flamingo, you need to move only 4 more steps to complete the 12 steps (as the circular path has 20 dots and moving 20 steps would bring you back to the starting point, the flamingo).\\n\\nSo from the golf ball, moving 4 steps clockwise, you would pass the Cardigan Welsh Corgi and land on the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
