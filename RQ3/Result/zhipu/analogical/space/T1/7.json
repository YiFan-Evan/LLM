Next, moving 3 steps clockwise from the pencil sharpener takes you past the paddle wheel and the viaduct, landing on the tram. Finally, moving another 3 steps clockwise from the tram takes you past the scarf to the pencil sharpener. Since you moved 1 step clockwise and then 1 step counterclockwise, those two moves cancel each other out, and you end up at the same position after the first and last set of movements.
