What item do you find?\\n   Solution A:\\n   Moving 5 steps from the Komodo dragon clockwise, you would pass the gown, the Australian Kelpie, the toy store, and the Great Dane, landing on the jack-o'-lantern. Therefore, the item you find is the jack-o'-lantern.\\n\\n2. Problem B:\\n   Starting from the toy store, you move 3 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution B:\\n   Moving 3 steps from the toy store counter-clockwise, you would pass the Great Dane and the jack-o'-lantern, landing on the wallaby. Therefore, the item you find is the wallaby.\\n\\n3. Problem C:\\n   You are at the Curly-coated Retriever and move 10 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution C:\\n   Since the path is circular with 10 items, moving 10 steps from the Curly-coated Retriever would bring you back to the starting point, which is the Curly-coated Retriever itself. Therefore, the item you find is the Curly-coated Retriever.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the jack-o'-lantern, you move 8 steps clockwise, which would bring you to the trolleybus. Then, you move 6 steps counter-clockwise from the trolleybus, which would bring you to the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog.
