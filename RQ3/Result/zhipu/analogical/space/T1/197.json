Problem: Starting from the fire screen sheet, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction.

To find the item after these movements, we need to calculate the total number of steps taken:\\n\\n16 + 18 + 5 + 16 = 55 steps\\n\\nSince there are 20 dots on the circular path, you can find the item after 55 steps by taking the total steps modulo the number of dots:\\n\\n55 mod 20 = 15\\n\\nThis means you land on the 15th item after the mosque.
