What item will you find?\\n   - Solution A: The academic gown is the starting point. Moving 5 steps clockwise, you pass the maypole, the rugby ball, and the poke bonnet, landing on the switch. Then moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from the switch, you pass the holster, the grey whale, the vacuum cleaner, the great grey owl, the Gordon Setter, the European garden spider, the scabbard, and the Basset Hound, landing back on the academic gown.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Starting from the academic gown, move 8 steps clockwise and then 15 steps counter-clockwise. What item will you find?\\n   - Solution B: Starting at the academic gown, moving 8 steps clockwise takes you past the maypole, the rugby ball, the poke bonnet, the switch, the holster, the grey whale, and lands you on the vacuum cleaner. Then moving 15 steps counter-clockwise from the vacuum cleaner, you pass the great grey owl, the Gordon Setter, the European garden spider, the scabbard, the Basset Hound, the pencil case, the spaghetti squash, the violin, and end up at the Norwich Terrier.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Starting from the academic gown, move 12 steps clockwise and then 18 steps counter-clockwise.
