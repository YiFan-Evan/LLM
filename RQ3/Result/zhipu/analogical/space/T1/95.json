Problem: Starting from the hard disk drive, you move around the circular path by 3 steps in a clockwise direction and then 2 steps in a counterclockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: You would end up at the same position as you started since you moved 3 steps forward and then 2 steps back, which is a net movement of 1 step forward. Therefore, you find a hard disk drive again.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the palace, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction and then 7 steps in a counterclockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving 5 steps forward from the palace lands you at the Great Dane. Moving 7 steps backward from there brings you to the police van.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the tricycle, you move around the circular path by 8 steps in a clockwise direction and then 4 steps in a counterclockwise direction.
