Problem: Starting from the church, you move around the circular path by 2 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 1 step in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we count the steps. Clockwise steps are positive, and counter-clockwise steps are negative. Starting from the church (position 0), we move 2 steps clockwise to the payphone (position 1), then 3 steps counter-clockwise back to the church (position 0), and finally 1 step clockwise to the payphone again. Therefore, the final answer is: payphone.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you start at the artichoke and move 1 step clockwise, then 2 steps counter-clockwise, and then 3 steps clockwise, what item will you end up on?\\n   Solution: Starting from the artichoke (position 5), we move 1 step clockwise to the vase (position 6), then 2 steps counter-clockwise to the Australian Silky Terrier (position 4), and finally 3 steps clockwise to the junco (position 7). Therefore, the final answer is: junco.\\n\\n3. Problem: You begin at the Kuvasz and take 5 steps counter-clockwise, then 2 steps clockwise, and then 4 steps counter-clockwise again.
