Problem: Starting from the bittern, you move 3 steps clockwise and then 2 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the bittern, moving 3 steps clockwise, you pass the suit, the scabbard, and reach the Kuvasz. Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the Kuvasz, you pass the scabbard and the suit, landing on the bittern again. Therefore, the item you find is the bittern.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the grocery store, you move 5 steps clockwise and then 4 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the grocery store, moving 5 steps clockwise, you pass the hockey puck, the swimming cap, the dowitcher, and reach the beaver, and then the bittern. Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the bittern, you pass the beaver, the dowitcher, the swimming cap, and the hockey puck, landing on the grocery store.

What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the candle, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise, you pass the grocery store, the hockey puck, the swimming cap, the dowitcher, the beaver, and the bittern, landing on the suit. Moving 6 steps clockwise from the suit, you pass the scabbard, the Kuvasz, the candle, and continue to the grocery store, the hockey puck, the swimming cap, and land on the dowitcher.
