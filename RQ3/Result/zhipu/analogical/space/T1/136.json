Problem: Starting at the golf ball, you move 6 steps clockwise, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 9 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we calculate the net movement: 6 + 9 - 3 = 12 steps clockwise. Since the path is circular and consists of 20 dots, we use modulo arithmetic to find the final position: (starting position + net movement) mod number of dots. The position is (1 + 12) mod 20 = 13 mod 20 = 13. The 13th item on the list is the Old English Sheepdog.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting at the golf ball, you move 4 steps counter-clockwise, then 7 steps clockwise, and finally 10 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: The net movement is 4 - 7 - 10 = -13 steps. To find the position, we calculate (-13) mod 20 = -13 + 20 = 7 (since we are adding 20 to move back into the positive range). The 7th item on the list is the Border Terrier.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting at the golf ball, you move 5 steps counter-clockwise, then 12 steps clockwise, and finally 8 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: The net movement is -5 + 12 + 8 = 15 steps clockwise. The position is (1 + 15) mod 20 = 16 mod 20 = 16. The 16th item on the list is the ant.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nYou move 8 steps counter-clockwise, then 5 steps clockwise, and finally 16 steps clockwise, and 14 steps counter-clockwise. The net movement is -8 + 5 + 16 - 14 = -1 step. Since the movement is negative and we are moving counter-clockwise, we find the position by adding 1 to the starting position and then taking the result modulo 20: (1 + (-1)) mod 20 = 0 mod 20 = 0. Since the position is 0, it means you are back at the starting dot.
