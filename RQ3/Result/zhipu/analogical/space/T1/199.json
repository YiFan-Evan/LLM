Problem: Starting from the snail, you move 3 steps clockwise, then 2 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 1 step clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the snail, moving 3 steps clockwise leads to the brain coral. Two steps counter-clockwise from the brain coral brings you to the stupa. One step clockwise from the stupa is the oboe. Therefore, the final answer is: oboe.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the brass, you move 4 steps counter-clockwise, then 3 steps clockwise, and finally 2 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the brass, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise leads to the Norwegian Elkhound. Three steps clockwise from the Norwegian Elkhound brings you to the yellow garden spider. Two steps counter-clockwise from the yellow garden spider is the pitcher. Therefore, the final answer is: pitcher.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the hatchet, you move 1 step clockwise, then 5 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 3 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the hatchet, moving 1 step clockwise leads to the syringe. Five steps counter-clockwise from the syringe brings you to the Geoffroy's spider monkey. Three steps clockwise from the Geoffroy's spider monkey is the barrel.
