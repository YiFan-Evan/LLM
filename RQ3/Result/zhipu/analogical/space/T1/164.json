Problem: Starting from the weevil, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 5 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count each movement step by step around the circular path. After 3 steps from the weevil, you reach the Kuvasz. Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the Kuvasz, you land on the weasel. Then, 5 steps clockwise from the weasel brings you to the bubble. Finally, 7 steps counter-clockwise from the bubble brings you to the wing. Therefore, the final answer is: wing.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the carousel, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 2 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the carousel, 2 steps clockwise bring you to the African wild dog. Three steps counter-clockwise from there bring you to the stage. Two more steps clockwise from the stage bring you to the cradle. Lastly, 5 steps counter-clockwise from the cradle bring you to the pelican. Therefore, the final answer is: pelican.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the table lamp, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction, then 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 1 step in a clockwise direction, and finally 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the table lamp, 1 step clockwise brings you to the switch. Two steps counter-clockwise from the switch bring you to the Siamese cat. One more step clockwise from the Siamese cat brings you back to the table lamp. Lastly, 4 steps counter-clockwise from the table lamp bring you to the doormat. Therefore, the final answer is: doormat.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the pelican, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction, which brings you to the stage. Then, you move 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the stage, which brings you to the disc brake. Moving 6 more steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the disc brake brings you to the hatchet. Finally, you move 12 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the hatchet, which brings you to the African wild dog.
