Problem: Starting from the mashed potato, you move 8 steps clockwise, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 5 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count the steps from the starting point (mashed potato). Moving 8 steps clockwise brings you to the cloak. Three steps counter-clockwise bring you to the cannon. Five more steps clockwise bring you to the crate. Therefore, the item is \\\"crate\\\".\\n\\n2. Problem: If you start at the scorpion and move 10 steps counter-clockwise, then 12 steps clockwise, and then 4 steps counter-clockwise, what item will you end up at?\\n   Solution: Starting at the scorpion, 10 steps counter-clockwise brings you to the bassoon. Twelve steps clockwise from there brings you to the T-shirt. Four steps counter-clockwise from the T-shirt brings you to the American bullfrog. Therefore, the item is \\\"American bullfrog\\\".\\n\\n3. Problem: From the otter, you move 7 steps clockwise, then 5 steps counter-clockwise, and then 7 steps clockwise again. What is the item you find?\\n   Solution: From the otter, 7 steps clockwise brings you to the bassoon. Five steps counter-clockwise from there brings you back to the otter. Another 7 steps clockwise brings you to the broccoli.
