Problem A:\\n   Description: You start at the hot dog and move 10 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To find the item, we count 10 steps from the hot dog moving clockwise. We pass the stove, platypus, espresso, snow leopard, Afghan Hound, bell-cot, and pelican, which makes 10 steps. Therefore, the item you find is the cockroach.\\n\\n2. Problem B:\\n   Description: You begin at the snow leopard and move 7 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To find the item, we count 7 steps from the snow leopard moving counter-clockwise. We pass the Afghan Hound, bell-cot, pelican, cockroach, newt, flagpole, and arrive at the revolver. Therefore, the item you find is the revolver.\\n\\n3. Problem C:\\n   Description: Starting at the tricycle, you move 5 steps clockwise, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 5 steps clockwise again. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: First, we move 5 steps clockwise from the tricycle, passing the mosque, trench coat, hot dog, stove, and stopping at the platypus. Then, we move 3 steps counter-clockwise to the hot dog. Finally, we move 5 steps clockwise again, passing the hot dog, stove, and stopping at the espresso.
