Problem: Starting from the lens cap, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you count each movement from the starting point. Clockwise moves you forward on the list, while counter-clockwise moves you backward. Starting at the lens cap and moving clockwise three steps takes you to the proboscis monkey. Moving counter-clockwise four steps from there takes you to the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Finally, moving clockwise five steps from the Cardigan Welsh Corgi lands you on the Schipperke.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the wild boar, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction, then 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Starting at the wild boar and moving clockwise seven steps takes you to the Affenpinscher. Moving two steps counter-clockwise from there brings you to the Tibetan Terrier. Then, moving clockwise eight steps from the Tibetan Terrier results in you landing on the valley.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the custard apple, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 10 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Starting at the custard apple and moving counter-clockwise five steps takes you to the apron. Moving clockwise ten steps from there brings you to the water jug.
