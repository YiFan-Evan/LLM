Problem: Starting from the koala, move 8 steps clockwise and then 4 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you move 8 steps clockwise from the koala and then 4 steps counter-clockwise. This results in a net movement of 4 steps clockwise. The koala is followed by the Affenpinscher, the analog clock, the church, and the electric fan. The fourth item after the koala is the electric fan.\\n   Answer: electric fan\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the warthog, move 12 steps counter-clockwise and then 20 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving 12 steps counter-clockwise from the warthog takes you back to the shield. Then, moving 20 steps clockwise from the shield will bring you to the analog clock.\\n   Answer: analog clock\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the cheeseburger, move 7 steps clockwise and then 7 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving 7 steps in either direction from the cheeseburger will bring you back to the cheeseburger itself, as you are effectively moving in a complete circle and returning to the starting point.\\n   Answer: cheeseburger\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the green mamba, you move around the ring by 15 steps clockwise, which brings you to the white-headed capuchin. Then you move 6 steps counter-clockwise, which takes you to the digital watch. After that, you move 17 steps clockwise from the digital watch, which brings you to the electric fan.
