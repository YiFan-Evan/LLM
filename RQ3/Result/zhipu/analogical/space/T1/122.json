Problem: Starting from the electric guitar, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we count 10 steps from the electric guitar moving clockwise. The items we pass are the Nile crocodile, the revolver, the bathtub, the King Charles Spaniel, the ski mask, the lorikeet, the pajamas, the space bar, and the magnetic compass. The 10th item is the spotlight. Therefore, the item found is the spotlight.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the Airedale Terrier, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Counting 5 steps backward from the Airedale Terrier, we pass the syringe, the Angora rabbit, the gazelle, the rhinoceros beetle, and finally, the plunger. Therefore, the item found is the plunger.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the confectionery store, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the confectionery store, we move clockwise past the loggerhead sea turtle, and then continue counting steps. Since we only need to move 8 steps, we do not complete a full loop. The items we pass are the loggerhead sea turtle, the triceratops, the plunger, the rhinoceros beetle, the gazelle, the Angora rabbit, the syringe, and the Airedale Terrier. The 8th item is the electric guitar. Therefore, the item found is the electric guitar.\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the King Charles Spaniel, we move 15 steps clockwise and then 15 steps counter-clockwise. Since the path is circular and we are going in both directions, we end up at the starting point, which is the King Charles Spaniel.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: King Charles Spaniel.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
