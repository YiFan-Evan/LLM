Problem: Starting from the African rock python, you move 2 steps clockwise and then 4 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you count 2 steps clockwise from the African rock python, which lands you on the dome. Then, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the dome brings you to the Griffon Bruxellois. Therefore, the item you find is Griffon Bruxellois.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the Griffon Bruxellois, you move 1 step counter-clockwise and then 3 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the Griffon Bruxellois brings you to the ping-pong ball. Then, moving 3 steps clockwise from the ping-pong ball brings you to the red wine. Therefore, the item you find is red wine.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the cornet, you move 5 steps counter-clockwise and then 2 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the cornet brings you back to the pole. Then, moving 2 steps clockwise from the pole brings you to the dhole.
