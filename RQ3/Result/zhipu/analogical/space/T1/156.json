Problem: Starting from the prayer rug, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you count 5 steps back from the prayer rug (counter-clockwise), which lands you on the Keeshond. Then, moving 3 steps forward (clockwise) from the Keeshond, you are on the vending machine. Finally, moving 4 steps back (counter-clockwise) from the vending machine, you end up at the crane.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the coho salmon, you move around the circular path by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, then 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 7 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Starting from the coho salmon, 8 steps clockwise bring you to the ring-necked snake. Then, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from there lands you on the moped. Another 7 steps clockwise from the moped brings you to the stone wall.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the tank, you move around the circular path by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 12 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the tank, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise brings you to the running shoe. Then, 12 steps clockwise from the running shoe takes you to the parking meter.
