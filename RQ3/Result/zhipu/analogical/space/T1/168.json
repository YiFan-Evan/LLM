To find the item, we need to add up these steps and see where you end up:\\n\\n8 (from Cairn Terrier) + 18 (from the next position) + 1 + 10 = 37 steps.\\n\\nSince the path has 20 dots, we need to find the position 37 steps from the starting point, considering that after 20 steps, you would loop back to the beginning. We calculate this by taking the total steps and finding the remainder when divided by the number of dots:\\n\\n37 % 20 = 17 (because 37 = 20 * 1 + 17).\\n\\nThis means you land on the 17th item after the Cairn Terrier. Counting from the Cairn Terrier:\\n\\n1. Cairn Terrier\\n2. Poncho\\n3.
