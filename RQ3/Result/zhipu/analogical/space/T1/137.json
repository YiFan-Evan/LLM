Problem: Starting from the African bush elephant, move 5 steps clockwise, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 4 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you count each step around the circular path. From the African bush elephant, moving 5 steps clockwise, you would pass the red admiral and land on the printer. Then, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise, you would pass the English Setter and the tree frog, landing on the rhinoceros beetle. Finally, moving 4 steps clockwise from the rhinoceros beetle, you would pass the ground beetle and the volcano, landing on the American lobster. The item found is the American lobster.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the Ibizan Hound, move 8 steps clockwise, then 6 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 9 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the Ibizan Hound, moving 8 steps clockwise, you would pass the African bush elephant, the red admiral, and land on the printer. Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the printer, you would pass the rhinoceros beetle, the ground beetle, and the volcano, landing on the American lobster. Finally, moving 9 steps clockwise from the American lobster, you would pass the tiger shark, the Norwich Terrier, the entertainment center, and land on the lemon. The item found is the lemon.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the entertainment center, move 4 steps counter-clockwise, then 12 steps clockwise, and finally 5 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the entertainment center, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise, you would pass the Norwich Terrier and the tiger shark, landing on the American lobster. Moving 12 steps clockwise from the American lobster, you would pass the volcano, the ground beetle, the rhinoceros beetle, the tree frog, the English Setter, and land on the printer. Finally, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the printer, you would pass the rhinoceros beetle, the ground beetle, and land on the volcano. The item found is the volcano.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\nStarting from the tiger shark, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction, which lands you on the Norwich Terrier. Then, you move around the ring by 13 steps in a clockwise direction from the Norwich Terrier, which lands you on the lemon. Next, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the lemon, which lands you on the American lobster. Finally, you move around the ring by 13 steps in a clockwise direction from the American lobster, which lands you on the printer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: printer.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
