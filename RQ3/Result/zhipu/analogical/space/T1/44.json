Problem: Starting from the Griffon Bruxellois, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then 4 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 2 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you would count 3 steps clockwise from the Griffon Bruxellois, which would bring you to the traffic sign. Then, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from there would bring you to the maraca. Finally, 2 steps clockwise from the maraca would place you at the jaguar. Therefore, the final answer is: jaguar.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the sea slug, you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction, then 6 steps clockwise, and then 3 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the sea slug, moving 1 step counter-clockwise brings you to the shower curtain. Then, 6 steps clockwise from the shower curtain would bring you back to the pirate ship. Finally, 3 steps counter-clockwise from the pirate ship would bring you to the Griffon Bruxellois. Therefore, the final answer is: Griffon Bruxellois.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the traffic sign, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 2 steps clockwise, and then 5 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the traffic sign, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise brings you to the maraca. Then, 2 steps clockwise from the maraca would bring you back to the Griffon Bruxellois. Finally, 5 steps counter-clockwise from the Griffon Bruxellois would bring you to the soap dispenser.
