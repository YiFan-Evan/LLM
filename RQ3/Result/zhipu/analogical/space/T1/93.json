Problem: Starting from the broccoli, you move around the circular path by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n\\n   Solution: You would end up back at the broccoli, as moving 3 steps in each direction cancels out the movement.\\n\\n2. Problem: Placed at the beginning of the path, you find a golden retriever. Moving clockwise from the golden retriever, the items are a Tibetan Mastiff, a red-tailed hawk, aGPS device, a cauliflower, a beehive, a martini glass, a watering can, a zucchini, and a parrot. Starting from the beehive, you move 4 steps counter-clockwise, then 4 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n\\n   Solution: You would find the GPS device, as you would move 4 steps back to the Tibetan Mastiff and then 4 steps forward to the GPS device.\\n\\n3. Problem: On a circular path with 8 connected dots, you start at the top with a basketball. The items on the path, moving clockwise, are a volleyball, a frisbee, a soccer ball, a baseball, a jump rope, a tennis ball, and a lacrosse stick. Starting from the jump rope, you move 1 step counter-clockwise, then 1 step clockwise. What item do you find?\\n\\n   Solution: You would still be at the jump rope, as moving 1 step in each direction cancels out the movement.\\n\\nNow, to the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the apiary, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise would bring you to the cocktail shaker.

Two steps counter-clockwise from there brings you to the black stork. Two steps clockwise from the black stork brings you to the Bluetick Coonhound.\\n\\n2. Problem: On a circular path with 10 connected dots, you start with a rabbit at the top. Clockwise from the rabbit are a turtle, a duck, a flashlight, a carrot, a beehive, a glass of water, a rake, a melon, and a sparrow.
