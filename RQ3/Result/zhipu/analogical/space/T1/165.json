Problem: Starting from the radio telescope, you move 7 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count 7 items moving clockwise from the radio telescope. The items in order are: hartebeest, pole, pot, oil filter, vulture, umbrella, lampshade. Therefore, the item found after 7 steps is a lampshade.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you start at the pot and move 14 steps counter-clockwise, what item do you encounter?\\n   Solution: Counting 14 items counter-clockwise from the pot, we pass the oil filter, vulture, umbrella, lampshade, black-footed ferret, infant bed, horizontal bar, cheetah, and so on.

Problem: Starting from the radio telescope, you move 5 steps clockwise.

Therefore, the item found after 12 steps is a horizontal bar.\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the home theater, you move 1 step clockwise, which brings you to the trilobite.
