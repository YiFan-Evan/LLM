Problem: Starting from the dowitcher, move 4 steps clockwise, then 2 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 3 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the dowitcher, moving 4 steps clockwise, you would pass the bakery, wing, and tray, landing on the chiffonier. Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise takes you back to the wing. Finally, moving 3 steps clockwise from the wing, you would pass the tray and land on the snoek. Therefore, the final answer is: snoek.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the wing, move 5 steps counter-clockwise, then 3 steps clockwise, and finally 5 steps counter-clockwise again. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the wing, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise would take you past the bakery, dowitcher, and to the high-speed train. Moving 3 steps clockwise from the high-speed train would take you to the plow. Another 5 steps counter-clockwise from the plow would take you past the crayfish, around the circle, and land on the barber chair. Therefore, the final answer is: barber chair.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the plow, move 2 steps clockwise, then 6 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 1 step clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the plow, moving 2 steps clockwise would take you to the high-speed train. Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the high-speed train would take you past the snoek, chiffonier, wing, bakery, dowitcher, and land on the tray. Finally, moving 1 step clockwise from the tray would take you to the crayfish. Therefore, the final answer is: crayfish.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\nStarting from the bakery, move 7 steps counter-clockwise to land on the dowitcher, then move 3 steps clockwise to the wing, and finally move 6 steps clockwise to the tray.
