Problem: Starting from the envelope, you move around the circular path 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we count 5 steps from the envelope: envelope -> Arctic fox -> eggnog -> warthog -> recreational vehicle -> Dutch oven.\\n   Answer: Dutch oven\\n\\n2. Problem: If you start at the red king crab and move 10 steps counterclockwise, what item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving counterclockwise from the red king crab, we would pass the newt, dung beetle, and thimble, which would be 3 steps. Then, we continue to pass the envelope, Arctic fox, and eggnog, which would be 6 steps. The 10th step would land on the item.\\n   Answer: Warthog\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the Italian Greyhound, you move around the circular path 15 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Counting 15 steps from the Italian Greyhound, we pass the dragonfly, zebra, and the first part of the circle until we reach the start again. Then we continue past the newt, dung beetle, thimble, and red king crab, landing on the envelope.\\n   Answer:Envelope\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the Arctic fox, you move around the ring by 20 steps in a clockwise direction. Since there are 20 items on the path, 20 steps will bring you back to the starting point, which is the Arctic fox.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Arctic fox\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
