Problem: Starting from the Egyptian Mau, move 4 steps clockwise and then 3 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we count 4 steps clockwise from the Egyptian Mau, which lands us at the beaker. Then, we move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the beaker, which lands us at the Egyptian Mau again.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the castle, move 7 steps clockwise and then 7 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving 7 steps clockwise from the castle, we reach the poke bonnet. Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from the poke bonnet, we return to the castle.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the library, move 10 steps counter-clockwise and then 5 steps clockwise.
