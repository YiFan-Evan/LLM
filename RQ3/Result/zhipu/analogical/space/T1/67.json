Then, moving 1 step counterclockwise from the CD player brings you back to the umbrella. Finally, moving 10 steps clockwise from the umbrella would bring you full circle and back to the umbrella again. Since these movements cancel each other out (1 clockwise and 1 counterclockwise is a net movement of 0, and 10 clockwise from the starting point is also a net movement of 0), you end up at the starting point.
