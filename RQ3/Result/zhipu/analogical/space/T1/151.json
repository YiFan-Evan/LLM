Therefore, the fifth item is a Carolina anole.\\n\\n2. Problem B: Starting from the doormat, you move 10 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution B: Counting 10 steps counter-clockwise from the doormat, we pass the megalith, police van, Egyptian Mau, football helmet, toy terrier, Polaroid camera, three-toed sloth, teapot, and reach the hermit crab.
