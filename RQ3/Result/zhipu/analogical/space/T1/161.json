Problem A:\\n   Description: Starting from the washing machine, you move around the circular path by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then 5 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 4 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution A: To solve this, you count each step around the circle, considering that moving clockwise is positive and counter-clockwise is negative. From the washing machine, moving 3 steps clockwise gets you to the acorn squash, 5 steps counter-clockwise takes you to the Toy Poodle, and 4 steps clockwise lands you on the sewing machine. The final item is the sewing machine.\\n\\n2. Problem B:\\n   Description: Starting from the Airedale Terrier, you move around the circular path by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 7 steps clockwise, and finally 10 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution B: From the Airedale Terrier, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise gets you to the horizontal bar, 7 steps clockwise takes you to the patas monkey, and 10 more steps clockwise lands you on the Gila monster.

Problem C:\\n   Description: Starting from the military aircraft, you move around the circular path by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction, then 3 steps clockwise, and finally 8 steps in a clockwise direction.
