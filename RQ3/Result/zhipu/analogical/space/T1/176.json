Problem: Starting from the Cocker Spaniels, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 7 steps counter-clockwise.

Moving clockwise from the Cocker Spaniels by 5 steps, we pass the football helmet, the Dungeness crab, the milk can, and the house finch, landing on the ram. Then moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the ram, we pass the Brittany and the aircraft carrier, landing on the eraser.
