Problem: Starting from the desktop computer, you move around the circular path by 7 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: The desktop computer is at position 6 (since the poke bonnet is at position 1). Moving 7 steps clockwise from the desktop computer, you pass the Toy Poodle, the boa constrictor, the dust jacket, the honeycomb, the damselfly, the shoe store, and land on the hartebeest at position 13.

Finally, moving 5 steps clockwise from the water buffalo, you pass the freight car and land on the semi-trailer truck at position 12.\\n   Answer: semi-trailer truck\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the goose, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 4 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 6 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: The goose is at position 3. Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the goose, you pass the mitten, the Bloodhound, the desktop computer, the Toy Poodle, and land on the boa constrictor at position 1. Moving 4 steps clockwise from the boa constrictor, you pass the dust jacket and land on the honeycomb at position 3.

Problem: Starting from the St. Bernard, you move around the circular path by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 8 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: The St. Bernard is at position 18. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the St. Bernard, you pass the semi-trailer truck and land on the pirate ship at position 16. Moving 8 steps clockwise from the pirate ship, you pass the water buffalo, the bulbul, the hartebeest, the shoe store, the damselfly, the honeycomb, the boa constrictor, and land on the desktop computer at position 8.
