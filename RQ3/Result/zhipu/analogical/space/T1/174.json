Problem: Starting from the black-and-white colobus, move 7 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count 7 items past the black-and-white colobus in a clockwise direction. The items you pass are: a safety pin, a rock crab, an indigo bunting, a weasel, an Alpine ibex, a partridge, and a baseball. Therefore, you find a baseball.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the gas mask, move 12 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count 12 items back past the gas mask in a counter-clockwise direction. The items you pass are: a CRT screen, a crate, a white stork, a grille, a hen-of-the-woods, a cauldron, a ruffed grouse, a tabby cat, a loupe, a safety pin, a black-and-white colobus, and a rock crab. Therefore, you find a rock crab.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the weasel, move 9 steps clockwise and then 4 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: First, move 9 steps clockwise from the weasel, passing the Alpine ibex, a partridge, a baseball, a sliding door, a sock, a gas mask, a CRT screen, and a crate, to land on a white stork. Then, move 4 steps counter-clockwise from the white stork, passing the crate, a hen-of-the-woods, a cauldron, and a ruffed grouse, to land on the tabby cat.

You end up at the sliding door.\\n\\n- From the sliding door, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise, you would pass: a sock, a gas mask, a CRT screen, a crate, a white stork, a grille, a hen-of-the-woods, a cauldron, a ruffed grouse, a tabby cat, a loupe, a safety pin, a black-and-white colobus, a rock crab, an indigo bunting, a weasel, and an Alpine ibex. You end up at the Alpine ibex.\\n\\n- From the Alpine ibex, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise, you would pass: a weasel, an indigo bunting, a rock crab, a black-and-white colobus, a safety pin, a loupe, a tabby cat, a ruffed grouse, a cauldron, a hen-of-the-woods, a grille, and a white stork. You end up at the sock.\\n\\n- From the sock, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise, you would pass: a sliding door, a baseball, a partridge, an Alpine ibex, and a weasel.
