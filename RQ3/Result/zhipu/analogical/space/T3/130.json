Problem A:\\n   Description: Starting from the lens cap, you move around the circular path by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution A: To solve this, we count each step and adjust for the circular nature of the path. Starting at the lens cap and moving clockwise past the mortar and proboscis monkey, we find the wild boar. Moving counter-clockwise past the Redbone Coonhound, we find the apron. Then moving clockwise, we pass the custard apple and find the flatworm.\\n\\n2. Problem B:\\n   Description: You start at the Tibetan Terrier and move 7 steps clockwise, then 5 steps counter-clockwise, and then 3 steps clockwise. Identify the item you end up at.\\n   Solution B: From the Tibetan Terrier, moving 7 steps clockwise would bring us to the water jug. Then, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise would bring us past the common sorrel and to the buckle. Finally, moving 3 steps clockwise from the buckle would bring us to the valley.\\n\\n3. Problem C:\\n   Description: Starting at the wild boar, you take 6 steps in a clockwise direction, then 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What is the item located at your final position?\\n   Solution C: From the wild boar, moving 6 steps clockwise would bring us past the Redbone Coonhound, apron, custard apple, flatworm, Schipperke, and worm snake to the half-track. Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise would take us past the Affenpinscher, Tibetan Terrier, water jug, common sorrel, buckle, dunlin, and back to the valley, and then to the Schipperke.
