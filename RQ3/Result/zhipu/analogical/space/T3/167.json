Problem: Starting from the drum, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 10 steps, and finally 15 steps. What item will you find?\\n   Solution: Since the path has 20 dots, moving in a circle, after every 20 steps you would be back at your starting point. So, 5 steps from the drum is the envelope, 10 steps from the drum is the llama, and 15 steps from the drum is the mongoose.\\n\\n2. Problem: You begin at the llama and move around the circular path by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then 6 steps, and finally 9 steps.

Problem: Starting from the football helmet, you move around the circular path by 7 steps in a clockwise direction, then 14 steps, and finally 21 steps. What item will you find?\\n   Solution: Starting at the football helmet and moving 7 steps is the orange, 14 steps is the school bus, and since 21 steps would be equivalent to 1 step (21 % 20 = 1), it would be the drum again.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\nStarting from the whistle, you move around the ring by 3 steps to the drum, 13 steps to the envelope, and 20 steps would bring you back to the whistle (since 20 is the total number of dots and you would complete one full circle).
