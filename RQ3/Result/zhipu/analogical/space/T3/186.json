Problem A:\\n   - Scenario: You start at the fireboat and move 15 steps clockwise, then 6 steps counter-clockwise, followed by 17 steps clockwise, and finally 10 steps clockwise.\\n   - Solution: Calculate the net movement by adding the clockwise steps and subtracting the counter-clockwise steps: (15 + 17 + 10) - 6 = 36 steps clockwise.
