Problem: Starting from the Otterhound, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction.

Problem: Starting from the Beagle, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction.

To solve this, we can add up the total number of steps taken:\\n\\n5 + 18 + 18 + 5 = 46 steps in total.\\n\\nSince there are 20 dots on the path, we can calculate the position by taking the total steps and finding the remainder when divided by 20 (because the path is circular):\\n\\n46 % 20 = 6 (this means you land on the 6th item after the European polecat when moving clockwise).\\n\\nStarting from the European polecat and moving 6 steps clockwise, you would pass the yawl, toy terrier, military aircraft, common squirrel monkey, and coral reef, ending up at the Beagle.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Beagle\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
