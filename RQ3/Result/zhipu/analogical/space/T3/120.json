Problem: Starting from the baluster, you move 4 steps clockwise and then 2 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: You would move from the baluster to the semi-trailer truck (1 step), to the microwave oven (2 steps), to the scooter (3 steps), and to the valley (4 steps). Then, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise, you would go back to the microwave oven and then to the baluster. Therefore, you find the baluster.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the dog sled, you move 7 steps counter-clockwise and then 7 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: You would move from the dog sled to the rapeseed (1 step), to the maze (2 steps), to the chameleon (3 steps), to the stage (4 steps), to the chain mail (5 steps), to the strawberry (6 steps), and to the toaster (7 steps) counter-clockwise. Moving 7 steps clockwise from the toaster would bring you back to the dog sled. Therefore, you find the dog sled.\\n\\n3.
