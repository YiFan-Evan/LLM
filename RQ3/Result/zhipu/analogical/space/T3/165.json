Problem: Starting from the radio telescope, you move 5 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Since the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 5 steps from the radio telescope (starting point) lands you on the 6th item, which is a pot.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the vulture, you move 12 steps counter-clockwise.
