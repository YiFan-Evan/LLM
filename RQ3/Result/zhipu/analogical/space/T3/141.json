Problem: Starting from the face powder, you move 3 steps clockwise, then 4 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 6 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you calculate the net movement: (3 + 6) - 4 = 5 steps clockwise from the face powder. Counting 5 steps clockwise from the face powder, you pass the Angora rabbit, the tent, and the dung beetle, landing on the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\\n   Answer: Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the Angora rabbit, you move 2 steps counter-clockwise, then 5 steps clockwise, and finally 7 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: First, calculate the net movement: (5 + 7) - 2 = 10 steps clockwise from the Angora rabbit. Counting 10 steps from the Angora rabbit, you pass the tent and the dung beetle, and land on the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, then pass the Shetland Sheepdog, the canoe, the cliff dwelling, the horizontal bar, and the printer, landing on the bolete.\\n   Answer: Bolete\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the upright piano, you move 4 steps counter-clockwise, then 3 steps clockwise, and finally 2 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Calculate the net movement: (3 - 4) - 2 = -3 steps, which is equivalent to moving 3 steps clockwise from the upright piano. Counting 3 steps from the upright piano, you pass the mountain bike and land on the leopard.\\n   Answer: Leopard\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the tent, you move 2 steps counter-clockwise to the dung beetle, then 5 steps clockwise to the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, and then 9 steps clockwise to the cliff dwelling. Finally, you move 8 steps counter-clockwise, which would take you back to the Angora rabbit and then to the face powder, but since the path is circular, you continue past the starting point. Counting 8 steps from the cliff dwelling in the counter-clockwise direction, you pass the horizontal bar, the printer, the bolete, the upright piano, the mountain bike, the leopard, the Leonberger, and land on the vulture.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Vulture\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
