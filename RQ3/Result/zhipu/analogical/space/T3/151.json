Problem: Starting from the sunglass, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To find the item, count 5 steps from the sunglass moving clockwise. The items in order are: sunglass, desk, bow tie, tiger beetle, Carolina anole. Therefore, the item found after 5 steps is a Carolina anole.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you start at the Komodo dragon and move 7 steps clockwise, what item will you land on?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count 7 steps from the Komodo dragon moving clockwise. Since there are 20 items and we're moving in a circular path, we can also calculate the position by subtracting 7 from 20 and considering the result in a clockwise direction. The Komodo dragon is the last item, so moving 7 steps clockwise would take us to: Komodo dragon, great white shark, chain, chainsaw, hermit crab, teapot, three-toed sloth. Therefore, the item found after 7 steps is a three-toed sloth.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting at the doormat, you move 12 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To find the item, count 12 steps from the doormat moving counter-clockwise. Since we're moving in the opposite direction, we can calculate the position by subtracting 12 from the current position. The doormat is the 6th item, so moving 12 steps counter-clockwise would take us to: doormat, megalith, police van, Egyptian Mau, football helmet, toy terrier, Polaroid camera, tiger beetle, bow tie, desk, sunglass. Therefore, the item found after 12 steps is a sunglass.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the umbrella, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. To find the final item, first move 18 steps counter-clockwise from the umbrella:\\n\\numbrella, doormat, megalith, police van, Egyptian Mau, football helmet, toy terrier, Polaroid camera, tiger beetle, bow tie, desk, sunglass.\\n\\nThen, move 2 more steps counter-clockwise:\\n\\nsunglass, desk.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: desk.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Problem: Starting from the sunglass, you move around the circular path by 10 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Counting 10 steps from the sunglass in a clockwise direction, we pass the following items: desk, bow tie, tiger beetle, Carolina anole, umbrella, doormat, megalith, police van, Egyptian Mau, football helmet. The 10th item is a football helmet.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the doormat, you move around the circular path by 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Counting 15 steps from the doormat in a counter-clockwise direction, we would pass the following items: megalith, police van, Egyptian Mau, football helmet, toy terrier, Polaroid camera, tiger beetle, bow tie, desk, sunglass, umbrella. The 15th item is the umbrella.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the Komodo dragon, you move around the circular path by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Counting 8 steps from the Komodo dragon in a clockwise direction, we would pass the following items: great white shark, chain, chainsaw, hermit crab, teapot, three-toed sloth, Polaroid camera, toy terrier. The 8th item is a toy terrier.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the umbrella, you move around the ring by 36 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Since the path is circular with 20 items, we can simplify the movements by calculating the total number of steps moved counter-clockwise and then finding the position.\\n\\n36 steps counter-clockwise from the umbrella would take you all the way around the circle (20 steps) and an additional 16 steps. Since we're moving counter-clockwise, we subtract these 16 steps from the position of the umbrella:\\n\\numbrella, doormat, megalith, police van, Egyptian Mau, football helmet, toy terrier, Polaroid camera, tiger beetle, bow tie, desk, sunglass (this is 12 steps from the umbrella, so we have 4 steps left to move).\\n\\nAfter the initial 36 steps, we move an additional 4 steps counter-clockwise, which brings us to the sunglass. Therefore, the final answer is:\\n\\nsunglass\""}]
