Starting from the orangutan and moving 36 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   Since the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 36 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 16 steps (because 36 - 20 = 16) counter-clockwise. This would bring you to the German Shorthaired Pointer.\\n\\n2. Then, moving 4 steps clockwise from the German Shorthaired Pointer:\\n   This would bring you to the microphone.\\n\\n3. Next, moving 26 steps counter-clockwise from the microphone:\\n   Moving 26 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 6 steps (because 26 - 20 = 6) counter-clockwise.

Finally, moving 34 steps clockwise from the longhorn beetle:\\n   Moving 34 steps clockwise is the same as moving 14 steps (because 34 - 20 = 14) clockwise.
