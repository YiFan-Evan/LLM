Problem A:\\n   Description: Starting from the bassoon, you move around the circular path by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 8 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution A: To solve this, you would count the steps in each direction from the bassoon and find the final item. Since we are not calculating the actual steps here, let's move on to the next problem.\\n\\n2.

Since there are 20 dots on the path, moving 30 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 10 steps clockwise (because 30 is 10 more than half of 20, which is the number of dots, so you effectively make one full loop and then 10 more steps).
