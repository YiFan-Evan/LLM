Starting from the lion, moving 34 steps counter-clockwise would take you all the way around the circle once (which is 20 steps), and then an additional 14 steps. Since the circle is circular, we can calculate the position by taking the total steps and finding the remainder when divided by 20 (the total number of dots).\\n\\n2.

Problem: Starting from the analog clock, move 25 steps clockwise, then 10 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: You would move past the barometer, alligator lizard, ping-pong ball, high-speed train, thimble, and cuirass, landing on the Chow Chow.

This would land you on the gyromitra.\\n2. 16 steps counter-clockwise from the gyromitra: (14 + 16) % 20 = 30 % 20 = 10 steps. This would land you on the analog clock.\\n3. 16 steps clockwise from the analog clock: (10 - 16 + 20) % 20 = 14 % 20 = 14 steps.
