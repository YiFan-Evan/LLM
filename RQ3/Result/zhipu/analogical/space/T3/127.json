Problem: Starting from the grocery store, move 5 steps clockwise and then 3 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the grocery store, moving 5 steps clockwise, you would pass the bolo tie, collie, basketball, spiny lobster, and rifle, ending up at the Sealyham Terrier. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from there, you would pass the grocery store, bolo tie, and collie, ending up at the basketball.\\n   Answer: basketball\\n\\n2.

Problem: From the rifle, move 32 steps counter-clockwise.\\n   Solution: Since the path has 20 dots, moving 32 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 12 steps (32 % 20 = 12) because the path is circular. From the rifle, moving 12 steps counter-clockwise would take you past the spiny lobster, basketball, collie, bolo tie, grocery store, traffic light, Treeing Walker Coonhound, infant bed, ping-pong ball, quilt, Bloodhound, and end up at the black-and-white colobus.\\n   Answer: black-and-white colobus\\n\\n3.
