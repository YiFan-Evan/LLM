Problem: Starting from the milk can, you move around the circular path by 7 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, first move 7 steps clockwise from the milk can, which lands on the bulletproof vest. Then move 3 steps counter-clockwise to the pineapple. Finally, move 2 steps clockwise to the balloon. The item found is: balloon.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you begin at the unicycle and move 5 steps clockwise, then 8 steps counter-clockwise, and lastly 4 steps clockwise, what item will you be standing next to?\\n   Solution: Starting from the unicycle, moving 5 steps clockwise brings you to the jacamar. Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from there brings you to the schooner. Finally, moving 4 steps clockwise from the schooner brings you to the siamang. The item found is: siamang.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the computer mouse, you take 6 steps clockwise, then 4 steps counter-clockwise, and then 3 more steps clockwise. What item do you end up at?\\n   Solution: From the computer mouse, moving 6 steps clockwise brings you to the toy store. Then moving 4 steps counter-clockwise takes you to the jack-o'-lantern.
