Problem: Starting from the goldfish, you move 32 steps clockwise.\\n   Solution: Since there are 20 dots on the path, moving 32 steps clockwise is the same as moving 12 steps after completing one full loop (32 % 20 = 12).

Problem: From the motorboat, you move 26 steps counter-clockwise.\\n   Solution: Moving 26 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 6 steps after completing one full loop (26 % 20 = 6).
