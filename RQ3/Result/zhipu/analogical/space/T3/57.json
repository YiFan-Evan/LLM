Problem: You start at the shoe store and move 5 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Starting at the shoe store and moving 5 steps clockwise, you would pass the snowplow, the sidewinder, the monastery, and the vault. The 5th step would land you at the grasshopper.\\n   Answer: grasshopper\\n\\n2. Problem: You begin at the crossword and move 3 steps counterclockwise.

The 8th step would land you at the monastery.\\n   Answer: monastery\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the paper towel, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction, which lands you at the crossword. Then, you move around the ring by 10 more steps in a clockwise direction. Since the path is circular and consists of 10 connected dots, 10 steps from the crossword would bring you back to the starting point, the paper towel. However, because you've already moved 7 steps to reach the crossword, you only need to move 3 more steps to return to the paper towel.
