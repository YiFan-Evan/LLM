Problem: Starting at the waffle iron, you move 5 steps clockwise.

Therefore, the item you find is: cannon.\\n\\n2. Problem: You begin at the tricycle and move 7 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Since there are only 5 items on the path, moving 7 steps clockwise from the tricycle means you complete the circle once and then move 2 more steps. This brings you to the waffle iron. Therefore, the item you find is: waffle iron.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting at the cannon, you move 3 steps counterclockwise.

Therefore, the item you find is: waffle iron.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nYou start at the odometer and move around the ring by 6 steps clockwise, which brings you to the waffle iron (since you pass the tricycle and the cannon).
