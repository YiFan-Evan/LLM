Problem: Starting from the cliff, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n\\n   Solution: To solve this, you count the steps around the circle, considering that moving clockwise is forward and counter-clockwise is backward. Starting from the cliff and moving clockwise 5 steps takes you to the American alligator. Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from there brings you to the lionfish. Then, moving 2 steps clockwise from the lionfish brings you to the eastern hog-nosed snake.\\n\\n2. Problem: You begin at the monastery and move 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 7 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction.
