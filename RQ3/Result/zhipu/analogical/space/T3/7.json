Since there are 5 items on the circular path, moving 6 steps from the pencil sharpener means you would complete one full loop around the circle and end up at the scarf (because you started at the second item and the tram is the first). Moving again from the pencil sharpener by 6 steps clockwise, you would again complete one full loop and end up at the scarf. Therefore, the final answer is: scarf.\""}]
