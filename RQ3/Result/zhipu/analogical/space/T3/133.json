Problem: Starting from the strawberry, you move around the circular path by 7 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count 7 items clockwise from the strawberry. The items in order are: strawberry, beaker, hen-of-the-woods, spider web, odometer, coral reef, wok. Therefore, you find a wok.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you start at the odometer and move 5 steps counter-clockwise, what item do you encounter?\\n   Solution: Count 5 items counter-clockwise from the odometer. The items in reverse order are: odometer, coral reef, wok, jigsaw puzzle, pirate ship, ring-tailed lemur. Therefore, you find a ring-tailed lemur.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the pot pie, move 3 steps clockwise and then 4 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you land on?\\n   Solution: First, move 3 steps clockwise from the pot pie, which lands you on the yellow garden spider. Then, move 4 steps counter-clockwise from the yellow garden spider. The items in reverse order are: yellow garden spider, knee pad, mushroom, ring-tailed lemur, pirate ship, jigsaw puzzle.

What will you find?\\n\\nSolution: \\n1. Move 11 steps counter-clockwise from the beaker. The items in reverse order are: beaker, spider web, odometer, coral reef, wok, jigsaw puzzle, pirate ship, ring-tailed lemur, mushroom, pot pie, yellow garden spider, knee pad, Black and Tan Coonhound.

This lands you on the hen-of-the-woods.\\n2. From the hen-of-the-woods, move 18 more steps counter-clockwise. Since you've already moved 22 steps, you only need to move an additional 18 steps. However, since the path is circular, you will eventually loop around to the beginning. Counting 18 more steps from the hen-of-the-woods, you loop around to the Black and Tan Coonhound, then to the ladle, and so on. This lands you on the consomme.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: consomme.\\\"\""}]
