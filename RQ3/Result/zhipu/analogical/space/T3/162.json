Problem: Starting from the carton, you move around the ring by 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.

Problem: Now, from the carton, you move around the ring by 32 steps in a clockwise direction.

Problem: From the Nile crocodile, you move around the ring by 22 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: 22 steps counter-clockwise from the Nile crocodile lands you on the Carolina anole, because 22 is 2 steps past the carton when moving counter-clockwise (20 - 18 = 2), and the Carolina anole is 2 items past the carton in the counter-clockwise direction.\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem:\\n\\n1.
