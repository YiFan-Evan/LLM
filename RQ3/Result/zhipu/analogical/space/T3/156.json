Problem: Starting from the prayer rug, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you would first move 5 steps counter-clockwise from the prayer rug, which lands you on the Keeshond. Then, moving 3 steps clockwise from the Keeshond, you would find yourself at the vending machine. Finally, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the vending machine, you would end up at the crane. The item you find is the crane.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the moped, you move around the circular path by 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 6 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the moped, you would reach the prayer rug. Then, moving 6 steps clockwise from the prayer rug, you would be at the Keeshond. Finally, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the Keeshond, you would end up at the coho salmon.

Problem: Starting from the running shoe, you move around the circular path by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 12 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction.

Problem: Starting from the drilling rig, you move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.

From the tank, you move around the ring by 30 steps in a clockwise direction. Since the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 30 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 10 steps (because 30 is 1.5 times the length of the circle, so you circle the entire map once and then go halfway around again). Therefore, moving 10 steps clockwise from the tank would take you to the moped.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: moped.\""}]
