Starting from the padlock, moving 26 steps clockwise:\\n   Since 26 is more than 20, we subtract 20 to find the equivalent position on the circle: 26 - 20 = 6 steps from the padlock in the clockwise direction. This lands us on the television.\\n\\n2. Moving 38 steps counter-clockwise from the television:\\n   Again, since 38 is more than 20, we subtract 20 to find the equivalent position on the circle: 38 - 20 = 18 steps from the television in the counter-clockwise direction. This lands us on the grey wolf.\\n\\n3. Moving 14 steps clockwise from the grey wolf:\\n   14 is less than 20, so we simply count 14 steps from the grey wolf in the clockwise direction, which lands us on the hammer.\\n\\n4. Moving 12 steps counter-clockwise from the hammer:\\n   12 is less than 20, so we count 12 steps from the hammer in the counter-clockwise direction, which lands us on the French Bulldog.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: French Bulldog.\""}]
