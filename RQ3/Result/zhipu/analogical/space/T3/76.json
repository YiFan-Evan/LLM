Problem: If you start at the lionfish and move 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 1 step clockwise, and then 5 steps counter-clockwise, what item will you find?\\n   Solution: German Shorthaired Pointer (since 3 steps counter-clockwise from the lionfish brings you to the academic gown, 1 step clockwise to the carbonara, and 5 steps counter-clockwise from there brings you to the Pointer).\\n\\nNow, to the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the academic gown, moving around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction brings you to the carbonara.
