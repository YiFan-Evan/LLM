Then we continue from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier for 24 more steps, but since there are only 20 dots, we must consider the circular nature of the path. After 4 steps from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, we would loop back to the turnstile (steps 17-20), and then continue from the turnstile for the remaining 20 steps: 1. wardrobe, 2. dome, 3. flamingo, 4. Angora rabbit, 5. duck, 6. badger, 7. sundial, 8. space bar, 9. confectionery store, 10. washing machine, 11. pirate ship, 12. carton, 13. Band-Aid, 14. Cocker Spaniels, 15.

This would bring us back to the turnstile.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: turnstile.\""}]
