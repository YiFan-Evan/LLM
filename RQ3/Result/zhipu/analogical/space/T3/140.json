Problem: Starting from the milk can, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps, and finally 11 steps. What will you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we first need to determine the position after each move. From the milk can, moving 7 steps forward leads to the mask. Then, moving 3 steps from the mask leads to the revolver. Finally, moving 11 steps from the revolver leads to the cliff dwelling.\\n   Answer: cliff dwelling\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the Arctic fox, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 9 steps, and finally 3 steps. What will you find?\\n   Solution: Starting from the Arctic fox and moving 5 steps forward leads to the milk can. From there, moving 9 steps leads to the pillow. Another 3 steps from the pillow will bring us to the Dobermann.\\n   Answer: Dobermann\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the eggnog, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, then 6 steps, and finally 10 steps. What will you find?\\n   Solution: From the eggnog, moving 8 steps forward leads to the Windsor tie. Moving 6 steps from the Windsor tie leads to the night snake. Finally, moving 10 steps from the night snake leads us to the ice pop.\\n   Answer: ice pop\\n\\nNow, let's solve the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the Arctic fox, moving 9 steps in a clockwise direction leads to the milk can. Moving 4 steps from the milk can leads to the mask. And finally, moving 16 steps from the mask leads to the Arctic fox again (since the path is circular and 20 steps would bring you back to the starting point, so 16 steps from the mask is 4 steps before the Arctic fox).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Arctic fox\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
