Problem A: Starting from the harvester, move 5 steps clockwise, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 4 steps clockwise.

From the harvester, moving 5 steps clockwise lands you on the Australian Kelpie. Then, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise takes you back to the drilling rig. Finally, moving 4 steps clockwise from the drilling rig lands you on the American coot.\\n\\n2. Problem B: Starting from the balloon, move 7 steps counter-clockwise, then 6 steps clockwise, and finally 9 steps counter-clockwise.

Then, moving 6 steps clockwise from the cougar takes you to the throne. Finally, moving 9 steps counter-clockwise from the throne brings you to the tile roof.\\n\\n3. Problem C: Starting from the weighing scale, move 10 steps clockwise, then 15 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 8 steps clockwise.

This lands you on the harvester.\\n2. Move 24 steps clockwise: This brings you to the microwave oven (since 24 % 20 = 4 steps from the harvester).\\n3. Move 34 steps clockwise: This is the same as 14 steps clockwise (since 34 % 20 = 14), bringing you to the tile roof.\\n4. Move 26 steps counter-clockwise: This is the same as 6 steps counter-clockwise (since 26 % 20 = 6), taking you from the tile roof to the mashed potato.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: mashed potato.\""}]
