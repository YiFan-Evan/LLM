Problem: Starting from the Miniature Schnauzer, move around the circular path by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. What item will you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count 8 steps from the Miniature Schnauzer moving clockwise. The items in order are: Miniature Schnauzer, tabby cat, Asian elephant, nematode, ambulance, minibus, rocking chair, catamaran. The 8th item is a catamaran.\\n   Answer: catamaran\\n\\n2. Problem: If you begin at the Gordon Setter and move 12 steps counter-clockwise, what item will you land on?\\n   Solution: Counting 12 steps counter-clockwise from the Gordon Setter, we would pass the Scottish Terrier, the poke bonnet, the shield, the chameleon, the husky, the goldfinch, the Dobermann, and the Band-Aid, and then continue past the Irish Terrier, the Miniature Schnauzer, and the tabby cat. The 12th item would be the Asian elephant.\\n   Answer: Asian elephant\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the Irish Terrier, move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 5 steps clockwise again. What item will you find?\\n   Solution: First, move 5 steps clockwise from the Irish Terrier, which lands on the Miniature Schnauzer. Then move 3 steps counter-clockwise to the tabby cat. Finally, move 5 steps clockwise from the tabby cat, which lands on the Asian elephant.\\n   Answer: Asian elephant\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the Asian elephant, move around the ring by 15 steps clockwise, which lands on the Miniature Schnauzer.

Starting from the Asian elephant, move around the ring by 30 steps clockwise. Since 30 is a multiple of 20 (20 steps make a full circle), you will end up at the Asian elephant again after completing the full circle.\\n\\n2. Then move around the ring by 38 steps counter-clockwise.
