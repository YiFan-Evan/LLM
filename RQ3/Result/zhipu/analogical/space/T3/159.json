Problem: Starting from the American bullfrog, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you count 7 steps from the American bullfrog, moving clockwise. Since there are 20 items on the path, you would find the item located at position 7 (counting the American bullfrog as position 1). The item at position 7 is the English Springer Spaniel.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the oxygen mask, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\\n   Solution: Counting 5 steps from the oxygen mask in a counter-clockwise direction, you would land on the black-footed ferret, as it is the item at position 16 on the path (since the oxygen mask is at position 20 and moving backward decreases the number).\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the church, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\\n   Solution: Counting 15 steps from the church, moving clockwise, you would find the green iguana, as it is the item at position 17 on the path (the church is at position 6).\\n\\nNow, to answer the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the European garden spider, you first move 11 steps counter-clockwise, which would take you to the shoji. Then, moving 11 steps clockwise from the shoji would bring you back to the European garden spider.
