However, since the path is circular, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise (because 10 steps make a full loop, and 20 is twice that, so you would be moving back to the starting point and then 2 steps forward). Therefore, from the harvestman, moving 2 steps clockwise lands you on the analog clock.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: analog clock.\""}]
