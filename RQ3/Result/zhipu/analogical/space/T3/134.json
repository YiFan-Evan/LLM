What item do you find?\\n   Solution: You move from the crate to the Lhasa Apso, the patas monkey, the prison, the analog clock, and then to the trolleybus. Therefore, the item you find is the trolleybus.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nYou start from the common redshank and move 32 steps counter-clockwise. Since there are 20 dots on the path, moving 32 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 12 steps clockwise (because 32 % 20 = 12). Starting from the common redshank and moving 12 steps clockwise, you would pass the pillow, the dock, the hyena, the acorn squash, the screw, the eel, the car mirror, the trolleybus, and the analog clock, landing on the prison.\\n\\nThen, you move an additional 40 steps counter-clockwise from the prison. Since 40 is twice the number of dots on the path, this would take you all the way around the path and back to the prison (because 40 % 20 = 0). Therefore, you would end up at the same position you were after the first movement, which is the prison.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: prison.\""}]
