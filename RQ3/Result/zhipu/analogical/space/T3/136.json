Moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the flamingo, you would be at the golf ball again. Then, moving 4 steps clockwise from the golf ball, you would end up at the bow tie.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the golf ball, you move 5 steps counter-clockwise, then 7 steps clockwise, and finally 10 steps counter-clockwise.
