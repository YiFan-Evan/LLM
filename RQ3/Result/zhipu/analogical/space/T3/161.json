Problem: Starting from the Border Collie, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 7 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you would calculate the net movement: (3 - 5 + 7) = 5 steps clockwise from the Border Collie. Counting 5 steps clockwise from the Border Collie, you would find the Toy Poodle.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the sewing machine, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 4 steps in a clockwise direction, and then 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: The net movement would be: (-2 + 4 - 6) = -4 steps, which is equivalent to 4 steps in a clockwise direction from the sewing machine's position. Counting 4 steps clockwise, you would find the acorn squash.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the military aircraft, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 5 steps in a clockwise direction.

Problem: Starting from the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.

Problem: Starting from the military aircraft, move around the ring by 38 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Since the path is circular with 20 dots, we can find the position by taking the movement modulo 20.
