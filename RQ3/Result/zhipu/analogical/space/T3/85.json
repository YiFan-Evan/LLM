Problem: Starting from the lakeshore, you move 4 steps clockwise around the circular path.

Problem: If you start at the missile and move 6 steps counterclockwise, what do you encounter?\\n   Solution: Starting at the missile (the second item) and moving 6 steps counterclockwise would take you 6 steps back from the missile. Since the path is circular and has 10 items, moving 6 steps counterclockwise from the second item lands you on the fifth item from the end, which is the cuirass.\\n\\n3. Problem: From the chimpanzee, you take 8 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Starting from the chimpanzee (the third item), moving 8 steps clockwise would take you past the chimpanzee and land you on the eleventh item if the path were linear.
