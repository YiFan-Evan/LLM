Problem: Starting from the sulphur butterfly, you move 4 steps clockwise and then 3 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you count 4 steps clockwise from the sulphur butterfly, which lands you on the smooth green snake. Then you move 3 steps counter-clockwise, which takes you back to the sulphur butterfly. Therefore, the final answer is: sulphur butterfly.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the Lhasa Apso, you move 6 steps counter-clockwise and then 5 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Counting 6 steps counter-clockwise from the Lhasa Apso, you would pass the water snake and land on the tiger beetle. Then moving 5 steps clockwise from the tiger beetle, you would pass the ice cream, cardigan, Sealyham Terrier, and harvester, landing on the spindle. Therefore, the final answer is: spindle.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the harp, you move 8 steps clockwise and then 4 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving 8 steps clockwise from the harp, you pass the jacamar, chameleon, bottle cap, sock, pajamas, Lhasa Apso, water snake, and land on the tiger beetle. Then moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger beetle, you pass the water snake, Lhasa Apso, and pajamas, landing on the sock.
