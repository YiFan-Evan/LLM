Problem: Starting from the garter snake, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 7 steps in a clockwise direction, then 6 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Calculate the total steps moved clockwise (5 + 7 + 6 = 18) and subtract the steps moved counter-clockwise (4). This gives us 18 - 4 = 14 steps clockwise from the garter snake. Since there are 20 dots, 14 steps from the garter snake (which is at the top) will lead to the Miniature Pinscher.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the school bus, you move around the circular path by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then 5 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Calculate the total steps moved clockwise (10 + 3 + 5 = 18) and subtract the steps moved counter-clockwise (2). This gives us 18 - 2 = 16 steps clockwise from the school bus. Counting 16 steps from the school bus leads to the American dipper.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the waste container, you move around the circular path by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, then 4 steps in a clockwise direction, then 10 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Calculate the total steps moved clockwise (8 + 4 + 10 = 22). Since the path has only 20 dots, we need to subtract 20 to get back to the starting point, which gives us 2 steps. Then subtract the steps moved counter-clockwise (6), which gives us -4 steps (meaning 4 steps counter-clockwise). Counting 4 steps counter-clockwise from the waste container leads to the green mamba.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the plate rack, you move 15 steps clockwise, then 14, then 8, and finally 3 steps counter-clockwise. Calculate the total steps moved:\\n\\n15 (clockwise) + 14 (clockwise) + 8 (clockwise) - 3 (counter-clockwise) = 34 - 3 = 31 steps clockwise.\\n\\nSince there are only 20 dots on the path, we calculate the position by taking the total steps modulo 20 (31 % 20), which gives us 11 steps from the starting point.\\n\\nCounting 11 steps from the plate rack in a clockwise direction, you will find the Miniature Pinscher.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Miniature Pinscher.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Problem: Starting from the green mamba, you move around the circular path by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, then 15 steps in a clockwise direction, then 20 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Calculate the total steps moved clockwise (10 + 15 + 20 = 45) and subtract the steps moved counter-clockwise (5). This gives us 45 - 5 = 40 steps clockwise.

Since there are 20 dots, we take 53 % 20 = 13 steps from the starting point.
