Problem: Starting from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What item will you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we count the steps: moving 4 steps clockwise from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier leads to the fiddler crab, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the fiddler crab leads to the cheeseburger, and moving 2 steps clockwise from the cheeseburger leads to the chime. Therefore, the final answer is: chime.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 5 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What item will you find?\\n   Solution: Counting the steps: moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier leads to the confectionery store, moving 5 steps clockwise from the confectionery store leads to the fountain pen, and moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the fountain pen leads to the magpie. Therefore, the final answer is: magpie.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, then 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 6 steps in a clockwise direction.
