Problem: Starting from the beaker, you move 3 steps clockwise, then 2 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 4 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we count the net steps taken. Moving 3 steps clockwise, then 2 counter-clockwise gives us a net movement of 1 step clockwise. Adding the final 4 steps clockwise gives us a total of 5 steps clockwise from the beaker. Since there are 10 dots, moving 5 steps from the beaker (which is the second dot) lands you on the boathouse (the seventh dot).\\n   Answer: boathouse\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the night snake, you move 1 step counter-clockwise, then 6 steps clockwise, and finally 3 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Counting the net steps, moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the night snake (the eighth dot) would put you at the Staffordshire Bull Terrier (the ninth dot). Then, moving 6 steps clockwise would circle back around to the night snake (since 9 + 6 = 15, and 15 - 10 (the number of dots) = 5, which is the night snake's position). Finally, 3 steps counter-clockwise from the night snake lands you on the alligator lizard (the seventh dot).\\n   Answer: alligator lizard\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the pug, you move 4 steps counter-clockwise, then 2 steps clockwise, and finally 8 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: From the pug (the tenth dot), moving 4 steps counter-clockwise would land you on the Angora rabbit (the sixth dot). Then, moving 2 steps clockwise from the Angora rabbit would put you on the night snake (the eighth dot). Finally, moving 8 steps clockwise from the night snake would circle around to the vine snake (since 8 + 8 = 16, and 16 - 10 (the number of dots) = 6, which is the vine snake's position).\\n   Answer: vine snake\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the obelisk (the fifth dot), moving 5 steps counter-clockwise lands you on the beaker (the first dot). Then, moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the beaker puts you on the vine snake (the second dot). Finally, moving 10 steps clockwise from the vine snake brings you full circle back to the obelisk (since 10 + 2 = 12, and 12 - 10 (the number of dots) = 2, which is the obelisk's position).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: obelisk\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
