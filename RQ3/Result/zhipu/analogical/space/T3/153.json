Problem: Starting from the desktop computer, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 2 steps in a clockwise direction.

Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the Toy Poodle brings you to the Bloodhound. Lastly, moving 2 steps clockwise from the Bloodhound leads you to the cheeseburger.\\n   Answer: cheeseburger\\n\\n2. Problem: If you begin at the goose and move 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 6 steps in a clockwise direction, and then 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, what item do you land on?\\n   Solution: Starting at the goose, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise takes you to the mitten. Moving 6 steps clockwise from the mitten brings you to the desktop computer. Then, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the desktop computer lands you on the Bloodhound.\\n   Answer: Bloodhound\\n\\n3.
