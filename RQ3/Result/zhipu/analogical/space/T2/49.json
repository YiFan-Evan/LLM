Problem: Starting from the pelican, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.

Then, we move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the measuring cup, which brings us to the fire engine.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you start at the billiard table and move 7 steps clockwise, then 4 steps counter-clockwise, which item do you end up at?\\n   Solution: Moving 7 steps clockwise from the billiard table takes us to the toilet paper. Then, moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from the toilet paper, we arrive at the spindle.\\n\\n3. Problem: From the position of the polar bear, you move 2 steps clockwise, and then 8 steps counter-clockwise.

Eight steps counter-clockwise from the soup bowl takes us back to the pelican.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the spindle, moving around the ring by 9 steps clockwise would take you to the toilet paper.
