Since there are 10 items on the path, moving 10 steps counterclockwise will bring you to the same position as if you had moved 10 steps clockwise (because the path is circular). Moving 10 steps clockwise from the barn, you would end up back at the barn. However, since we are moving counterclockwise, you would simply move to the item directly before the barn in the sequence, which is the waffle iron. Therefore, the final answer is: waffle iron.\""}]
