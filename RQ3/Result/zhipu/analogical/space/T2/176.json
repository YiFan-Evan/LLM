At the start, you are positioned on the dot that is located at the top of the path, where you find a moving van.

What will you find?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Here are three related but not identical problems with their descriptions and solutions:\\n\\n1. Problem: Starting from the Cocker Spaniels, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 7 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n\\n   Solution: To solve this, we need to calculate the net movement. Moving 5 steps clockwise, then 3 steps counter-clockwise results in a net movement of 2 steps clockwise. Adding the final 7 steps clockwise gives a total net movement of 9 steps clockwise. Counting 9 steps from the Cocker Spaniels clockwise, you pass the football helmet, the Dungeness crab, the milk can, the house finch, and the ram, landing on the Brittany. Therefore, the final answer is: Brittany.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the aircraft carrier, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 4 steps clockwise, and finally 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n\\n   Solution: Again, we calculate the net movement. Moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from the aircraft carrier, you pass the eraser, the Standard Poodle, the black-and-white colobus, and the high-speed train, landing on the ground beetle. Then, moving 4 steps clockwise, you pass the maraca and land on the yurt. Finally, moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the yurt, you pass the throne, the suspension bridge, and the proboscis monkey, landing on the turnstile. Therefore, the final answer is: Turnstile.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the house finch, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction, then 2 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 12 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n\\n   Solution: Calculate the net movement. Moving 7 steps clockwise from the house finch, you pass the ram and land on the Brittany. Then, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise, you land on the aircraft carrier. Finally, moving 12 steps clockwise from the aircraft carrier, you pass the eraser, the Standard Poodle, the black-and-white colobus, the high-speed train, the ground beetle, the maraca, the yurt, the throne, and land on the suspension bridge. Therefore, the final answer is: Suspension Bridge.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the football helmet, you move 15 steps counter-clockwise, which lands you on the house finch. Then, you move 8 steps counter-clockwise from the house finch, which lands you on the ram. Finally, you move 20 steps counter-clockwise from the ram, which brings you back to the starting point, the football helmet. Since you've made a complete loop and landed on the starting item, the final answer is:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Football Helmet.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Therefore, the final answer is: Aircraft Carrier.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the turnstile, you move 15 steps clockwise, which lands you on the proboscis monkey.
