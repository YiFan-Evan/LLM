Problem: Starting from the banjo, you move 4 steps clockwise, then 5 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 6 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you count the steps around the circle, taking care to wrap around when you reach the end. Starting at the banjo and moving 4 steps clockwise, you would land on the lighter. Moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from there would bring you to the trolleybus. Finally, moving 6 steps clockwise from the trolleybus, you would end up at the holster. The item found is \\\"holster\\\".\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the chain-link fence, you move 8 steps counter-clockwise, then 10 steps clockwise, and finally 12 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Starting at the chain-link fence and moving 8 steps counter-clockwise, you would land on the trilobite. Moving 10 steps clockwise from the trilobite would bring you to the face powder. Then, moving 12 steps counter-clockwise from the face powder, you would end up at the otter.
