Problem: Starting from the Griffon Bruxellois, you move 2 steps clockwise, then 4 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 1 step clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we count the net number of steps moved. Moving 2 steps clockwise and then 4 steps counter-clockwise results in a net movement of 2 steps counter-clockwise. Adding the final 1 step clockwise results in a net movement of 1 step counter-clockwise. Starting from the Griffon Bruxellois and moving 1 step counter-clockwise, you find the African rock python.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you begin at the home theater and move 5 steps clockwise, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and 2 more steps clockwise, what item do you end up at?\\n   Solution: The net movement here is 5 steps clockwise minus 3 steps counter-clockwise, plus 2 more steps clockwise, which totals 4 steps clockwise. Starting from the home theater and moving 4 steps clockwise, you would find the cornet.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the red wine, you move 1 step counter-clockwise, then 3 steps clockwise, and finally 2 steps counter-clockwise. What is the item at your final position?\\n   Solution: The net movement is 1 step counter-clockwise minus 3 steps clockwise, plus 2 steps counter-clockwise, which results in a net movement of 0 steps (you return to the starting point). Thus, you find the red wine again.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the dhole and moving 3 steps counter-clockwise, you would be at the dome. Then, moving 1 step clockwise from the dome, you would be at the Griffon Bruxellois.
