Since there are 20 dots, moving 5 steps clockwise from the Nile crocodile lands you on the academic gown. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from there brings you to the taxicab.\\n   Answer A: taxicab\\n\\n2. Problem B:\\n   Description: Starting at the red fox, move 8 steps counter-clockwise and then 12 steps clockwise.
