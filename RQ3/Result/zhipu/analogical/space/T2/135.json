Problem: Starting from the Miniature Schnauzer, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, then 6 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 4 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, you count the steps in each direction, adjusting for the circular nature of the map. Starting from the Miniature Schnauzer and moving 8 steps clockwise, you pass the tabby cat, the Asian elephant, the nematode, and land on the ambulance. Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise from the ambulance, you pass the minibus and the rocking chair, landing on the catamaran. Finally, moving 4 steps clockwise from the catamaran, you pass the Christmas stocking and land on the tow truck.\\n   Answer: tow truck\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the Gordon Setter, you move around the ring by 12 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 9 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Starting from the Gordon Setter and moving 12 steps clockwise, you pass the Scottish Terrier, the poke bonnet, the shield, the chameleon, the husky, the goldfinch, and land on the Dobermann. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the Dobermann, you pass the Band-Aid and land on the Asian elephant.
