What item do you find?\\n   - **Solution A**: Since there are 20 dots and we are moving 10 steps clockwise from the Asian elephant, we would make half a loop. Therefore, we would end up at the item that is directly opposite the Asian elephant on the path. Counting from the Asian elephant, the 10th item in a clockwise direction is the flatworm. \\n   - **Answer A**: flatworm\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Starting from the throne, move 5 steps counter-clockwise around the circular path.
