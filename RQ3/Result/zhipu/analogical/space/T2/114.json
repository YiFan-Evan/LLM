Problem: Starting from the syringe, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 2 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count each step around the circle, considering that the circle has 10 dots. Starting from the syringe and moving clockwise 5 steps brings you to the station wagon. Moving 4 steps counter-clockwise from there brings you to the Miniature Pinscher. Finally, 2 more clockwise steps bring you to the oystercatcher. The item you find is the oystercatcher.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you start at the top of the path with the pencil case and move 7 steps clockwise, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and then 1 step clockwise, what item will you be at?\\n   Solution: Starting from the pencil case and moving 7 steps clockwise brings you to the Miniature Pinscher. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from there brings you to the syringe. One more step clockwise leads you to the station wagon. The item you find is the station wagon.\\n\\n3. Problem: From the purse, you move 2 steps counter-clockwise, then 6 steps clockwise, and then 3 steps counter-clockwise again. What item do you end up at?\\n   Solution: Starting from the purse and moving 2 steps counter-clockwise brings you to the Clumber Spaniel. Moving 6 steps clockwise from there brings you to the syringe. Finally, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the syringe brings you to the station wagon.
