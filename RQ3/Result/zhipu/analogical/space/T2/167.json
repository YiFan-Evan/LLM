Problem: Starting from the drum, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then 7 steps, and finally 10 steps. What item do you find?\\n\\nSolution: Since the path has 20 connected dots, moving 5 steps from the drum will bring you to the megalith. Moving another 7 steps (which is 12 steps in total from the drum) will bring you to the envelope. Finally, moving 10 more steps (which is 22 steps in total from the drum) will bring you back to the drum, as you have completed a full circle and started a new one. So the final item is the drum.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the llama, you move around the circular path by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then 6 steps, and finally 9 steps. What item do you find?\\n\\nSolution: Moving 3 steps from the llama will bring you to the mongoose. Another 6 steps from there will bring you to the football helmet (since 3 + 6 = 9 steps from the llama). Finally, moving 9 more steps from the llama (which is 18 steps in total) will bring you to the Irish Terrier. So the final item is the Irish Terrier.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the envelope, you move around the circular path by 4 steps in a clockwise direction, then 8 steps, and finally 12 steps. What item do you find?\\n\\nSolution: Moving 4 steps from the envelope will bring you to the ground beetle. Another 8 steps from there will bring you to the orange (since 4 + 8 = 12 steps from the envelope). Finally, moving 12 more steps from the envelope (which is 24 steps in total) will bring you back to the envelope, as you have completed a full circle and started a new one. So the final item is the envelope.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the whistle, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then 13 steps, and you move around the ring by 20 steps in a clockwise direction.\\n\\nSolution: Moving 3 steps from the whistle will bring you to the drum. Moving 13 more steps from the drum will bring you to the Australian Kelpie (since 3 + 13 = 16 steps from the whistle). Finally, moving 20 more steps from the whistle will bring you back to the whistle, as you have completed a full circle (20 steps from the whistle is exactly one full loop).
