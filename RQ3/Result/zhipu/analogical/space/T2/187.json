Problem A:\\n   Description: Starting from the academic gown, you move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, then you move 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we calculate the net movement: 5 steps clockwise minus 10 steps counter-clockwise equals -5 steps (or 5 steps counter-clockwise). Starting from the academic gown and moving 5 steps counter-clockwise, you pass the maypole, the rugby ball, and the poke bonnet to find the switch.\\n   Answer: switch\\n\\n2. Problem B:\\n   Description: You begin at the academic gown and move 12 steps clockwise, then you decide to go back 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you end up with?\\n   Solution: The net movement is 12 steps clockwise minus 6 steps counter-clockwise, which equals 6 steps clockwise. Starting from the academic gown and moving 6 steps clockwise, you pass the maypole, the rugby ball, and the poke bonnet, then the switch, the holster, and find the grey whale.\\n   Answer: grey whale\\n\\n3. Problem C:\\n   Description: From the academic gown, you take 8 steps clockwise, then you change direction and move 8 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find yourself at?\\n   Solution: The net movement is 8 steps clockwise minus 8 steps counter-clockwise, which equals 0 steps. Therefore, you remain at the starting point, which is the academic gown.\\n   Answer: academic gown\\n\\nNow, to solve the original problem:\\n\\nYou move 7 steps clockwise from the academic gown, which would take you past the maypole, the rugby ball, the poke bonnet, the switch, the holster, and the grey whale to the vacuum cleaner. Then you move 20 steps counter-clockwise from the academic gown, which is equivalent to one full loop around the circle (20 steps) minus the 7 steps you initially moved clockwise. This would take you back to the academic gown and then 13 steps further counter-clockwise. Counting 13 steps counter-clockwise from the academic gown, you would pass the maypole, the rugby ball, the poke bonnet, the switch, the holster, the grey whale, the vacuum cleaner, the great grey owl, and the Gordon Setter to find the European garden spider.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: European garden spider\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
