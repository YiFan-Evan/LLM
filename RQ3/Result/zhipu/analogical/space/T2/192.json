Problem: Starting from the zucchini, move 8 steps clockwise, then 5 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 3 steps clockwise.

Then, we move 5 steps counter-clockwise to the Boston Terrier. Finally, we move 3 steps clockwise to find the Miniature Poodle.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the dragonfly, move 7 steps counter-clockwise, then 10 steps clockwise, and finally 4 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Starting at the dragonfly and moving 7 steps counter-clockwise takes us to the Basset Hound. Then, 10 steps clockwise from there brings us to the wild boar.
