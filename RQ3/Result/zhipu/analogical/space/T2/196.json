Problem: Starting from the lemon, move around the circular path by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count 5 items clockwise from the lemon. Lemon -> Guinea Pig -> Boston Terrier -> African Rock Python -> Balance Beam -> Cheeseburger. The item found is a cheeseburger.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the sarong, move around the circular path by 10 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count 10 items counter-clockwise from the sarong. Sarong -> Malinois -> Jacamar -> Tailed Frog -> Jaguar -> Chain-Link Fence -> Axolotl -> Cheeseburger -> Balance Beam -> African Rock Python -> Guinea Pig. The item found is a guinea pig.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the safety pin, move around the circular path by 15 steps in a clockwise direction, then move 3 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: First, move 15 steps clockwise from the safety pin. Safety Pin -> Projectile -> Spoonbill -> Water Tower -> Lemon -> Guinea Pig -> Boston Terrier -> African Rock Python -> Balance Beam -> Cheeseburger -> Axolotl -> Chain-Link Fence -> Jaguar -> Tailed Frog -> Jacamar -> Malinois -> Sarong. Now, move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the sarong. Sarong -> Malinois -> Jacamar -> Tailed Frog.
