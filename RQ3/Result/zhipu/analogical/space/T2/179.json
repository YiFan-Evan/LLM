Problem: Starting from the muzzle, you move 3 steps clockwise, then 5 steps clockwise, and finally 7 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, we add the steps together (3 + 5 + 7 = 15 steps). Since there are 20 dots on the circle, we can find the item by moving 15 steps from the starting point (muzzle). Counting around the circle, the 15th item is a Windsor tie.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you start at the altar and move 2 steps clockwise, then 4 steps clockwise, and then 8 steps clockwise, what item do you find?\\n   Solution: Adding the steps together gives us 2 + 4 + 8 = 14 steps.

Problem: From the ladybug, you take 1 step clockwise, then 3 steps clockwise, and then 9 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Adding the steps gives us 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 steps.
