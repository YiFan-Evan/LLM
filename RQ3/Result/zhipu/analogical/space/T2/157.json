Problem: If you begin at the website and move 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 2 steps clockwise, and finally 5 steps counter-clockwise, what item will you be at?\\n   Solution: From the website, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise lands on the disc brake. Moving 2 steps clockwise from there brings us to the desk. Finally, 5 steps counter-clockwise from the desk takes us to the orange.\\n   Answer: orange\\n\\n3.
