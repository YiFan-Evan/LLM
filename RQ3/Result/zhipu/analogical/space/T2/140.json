Problem: You are positioned at the Dutch oven and move 3 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: You move from the Dutch oven to the cowboy hat, then to the Australian Terrier, and finally to the goldfinch. Therefore, the item you find is the goldfinch.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the Arctic fox, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction.

To solve this, we need to calculate the total steps moved and then find the item at that position.\\n\\nTotal steps = 9 + 4 + 16 = 29 steps\\n\\nSince the path is circular with 20 dots, we can find the position by taking the total steps modulo the number of dots:\\n\\n29 % 20 = 9 (because 29 = 20 * 1 + 9)\\n\\nThis means after moving 29 steps from the Arctic fox, you land on the 9th item after the Arctic fox.
