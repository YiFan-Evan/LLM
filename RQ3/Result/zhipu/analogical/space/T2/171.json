What item do you find?\\n   - **Solution A**: To solve this, we start at the longhorn beetle and move 5 steps clockwise to the red wolf, then 7 steps counter-clockwise to the medicine chest, and finally 3 steps clockwise to the wok. Therefore, the final answer is: wok.\\n\\n2. **Problem B**: Starting from the microphone, you move around the circular path by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 6 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   - **Solution B**: Starting at the microphone, we move 4 steps counter-clockwise to the German Shorthaired Pointer, then 6 steps clockwise to the King Charles Spaniel, and finally 8 steps counter-clockwise to the Wire Fox Terrier. Therefore, the final answer is: Wire Fox Terrier.\\n\\n3. **Problem C**: Starting from the hermit crab, you move around the circular path by 9 steps in a clockwise direction, then 11 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\\n   - **Solution C**: Starting at the hermit crab, we move 9 steps clockwise to the flagpole, then 11 steps counter-clockwise to the mousetrap, and finally 5 steps clockwise to the siamang.
