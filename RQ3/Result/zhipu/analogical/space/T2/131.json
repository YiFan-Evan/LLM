Problem: Starting from the sulphur butterfly, you move 5 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: You pass the leopard, smooth green snake, harp, jacamar, and chameleon. The fifth item is the bottle cap.\\n   Answer: bottle cap\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the organ, you move 3 steps counter-clockwise and then 4 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving counter-clockwise from the organ, you would pass the sulphur butterfly and the leopard. Then moving clockwise past the organ again, you would pass the sulphur butterfly, and end up at the leopard.\\n   Answer: leopard\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the safety pin, you move 10 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Since the path is circular with 20 items, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise would be the same as moving 10 steps clockwise from the safety pin. You would pass the electric fan, harvester, Sealyham Terrier, cardigan, ice cream, tiger beetle, and water snake, and end up at the Lhasa Apso.\\n   Answer: Lhasa Apso\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the ice cream, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise would bring you to the tiger beetle. Moving 7 more steps counter-clockwise would bring you to the Sealyham Terrier. Then, moving 9 steps clockwise from the Sealyham Terrier would bring you back to the tiger beetle (since you move past 9 items clockwise: Sealyham Terrier, harvester, electric fan, safety pin, Lhasa Apso, water snake, tiger beetle, organ, sulphur butterfly).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: tiger beetle\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
