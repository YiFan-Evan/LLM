Moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from the rattlesnake would take you past the bald eagle, jay, spider web, tiger shark, sock, movie theater, and stop at the manhole cover.

What item do you end up at?\\n   - **Solution B**: From the shopping cart, moving counter-clockwise, you would pass the Bedlington Terrier, manhole cover, bell-cot, and land on the Tibetan Terrier. Moving 10 steps clockwise from the Tibetan Terrier would take you past the sundial, eastern diamondback rattlesnake, bald eagle, jay, spider web, tiger shark, sock, movie theater, plectrum, and stop at the broccoli.

Moving 9 steps counter-clockwise from the plectrum would take you past the broccoli, odometer, mixing bowl, bikini, speaker, vacuum cleaner, and stop at the manhole cover.
