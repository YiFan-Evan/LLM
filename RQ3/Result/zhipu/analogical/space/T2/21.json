Problem: Starting from the electric locomotive, you move around the circular path by 2 steps in a clockwise direction.

Problem: If you begin at the common squirrel monkey and move 4 steps counterclockwise, what item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving counterclockwise from the common squirrel monkey, you would pass the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the electric locomotive, and the hoop skirt, landing on the seashore.
