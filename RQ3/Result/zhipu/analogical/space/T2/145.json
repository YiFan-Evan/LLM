Problem: Starting from the ear, you move around the circular path by 7 steps in a clockwise direction, then 3 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 5 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n\\n   Solution: To solve this, we calculate the total movement: 7 + (-3) + 5 = 9 steps clockwise. Starting from the ear and moving 9 steps clockwise, you would pass the monastery, the baboon, the hare, the convertible, the altar, the infant bed, the washing machine, and the ladle, landing on the chimpanzee.\\n\\n2. Problem: If you begin at the motorboat and move 12 steps clockwise, then 6 steps counter-clockwise, and another 9 steps clockwise, what item will you end up at?\\n\\n   Solution: The total movement is 12 + (-6) + 9 = 15 steps clockwise. Starting from the motorboat and moving 15 steps clockwise, you would pass the custard apple, the sea urchin, the brain coral, the beer bottle, the goldfish, the Alpine ibex, and continue to the red king crab, the ear, the monastery, the baboon, the hare, and the convertible, landing on the altar.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the washing machine, you take 8 steps clockwise, then 4 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 7 steps counter-clockwise. What is the item you find?\\n\\n   Solution: The total movement is 8 + (-4) + (-7) = -3 steps, which means 3 steps counter-clockwise.

Let's calculate the total movement:\\n\\n16 (clockwise) + (-4) (counter-clockwise) + (-13) (counter-clockwise) + 4 (clockwise) = 16 - 4 - 13 + 4 = 3 steps clockwise.\\n\\nStarting from the goldfish and moving 3 steps clockwise, you would pass the Alpine ibex and land on the red king crab.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: red king crab.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.

Problem: Starting from the monastery, you move around the circular path by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then 3 steps clockwise, and finally 5 steps counter-clockwise.
