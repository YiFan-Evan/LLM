Problem: Starting from the Egyptian Mau, you move 8 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: To solve this, count 8 items clockwise from the Egyptian Mau. The items in order are: Egyptian Mau, beaker, croquet ball, oscilloscope, Vizsla, assault rifle, wok, chain mail. Therefore, after 8 steps, you find a chain mail.\\n\\n2. Problem: Starting from the castle, you move 3 steps counter-clockwise and then 7 steps clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: First, move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the castle, which would be: castle, poke bonnet, mosque, sea anemone. Then move 7 steps clockwise from the sea anemone, which would take you past the cowboy boot, rocking chair, radiator, go-kart, paper knife, baseball player, and finally to the library. Therefore, after these movements, you find a library.\\n\\n3. Problem: Starting from the wok, you move 5 steps clockwise and then 10 steps counter-clockwise. What item do you find?\\n   Solution: Moving 5 steps clockwise from the wok, you would pass: chain mail, castle, poke bonnet, mosque, and sea anemone. Then, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from the sea anemone, you would go back past: mosque, poke bonnet, castle, chain mail, wok, Egyptian Mau, beaker, croquet ball, oscilloscope, and Vizsla, ending at the assault rifle. Therefore, after these movements, you find an assault rifle.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nStarting from the rocking chair, you move around the ring by 5 steps clockwise (which would take you to the radiator), then 12 steps counter-clockwise (which would take you to the Egyptian Mau), then 5 steps clockwise again (which would take you to the beaker), and finally 3 steps counter-clockwise (which would take you to the wok).
