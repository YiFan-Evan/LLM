It seems there is a mistake in the code snippet; the variable `i` is not defined before it's used. Assuming the variable `i` should be `q`, here is the corrected loop and the loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm:\\n\\n```python\\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\\n    q = 0\\n    while q < len(arr):\\n        i = q\\n        while i > 0 and arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:\\n            temp = arr[i]\\n            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]\\n            arr[i - 1] = temp\\n            i -= 1\\n        q += 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm is:\\n\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the subarray from the start up to the element at index `q-1` is sorted after `q` iterations of the outer loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    while q <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There seems to be a mistake in the provided code snippet as well; the variable `i` is not defined before it's used.
