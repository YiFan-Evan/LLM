This states that the count at index i is equal to the number of times the integer i appears in the subarray from the current index to the end of the array after the i-th iteration of the loop.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, which is the selection sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the selection sort algorithm is: `arr[0..i-1]_sorted = sorted(arr[0..i-1])`.
