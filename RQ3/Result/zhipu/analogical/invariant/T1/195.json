The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This invariant states that the first `i` elements are sorted after `i` iterations of the inner loop.\\n\\n2. **Insertion Sort**:\\n   - **Description**: Build the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant**: `arr[0->i] = fun(arr[0->i])` after the `i-th` iteration of the loop where `i` is the index of the current element being placed in its correct position. This invariant asserts that the subarray `arr[0->i]` is sorted.\\n\\n3. **Merge Sort**:\\n   - **Description**: Divide the array into halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves back together.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant**: Since merge sort is a recursive algorithm, the loop invariant would apply to the merge step: `left_half = fun(left_half)` and `right_half = fun(right_half)` before merging, and `merged_array = fun(left_half->right_half)` after merging the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem of the selection sort algorithm, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- **Selection Sort Loop Invariant**: `arr[0->p-1] = fun(arr[0->p-1])` for each iteration of the outer loop, where `p` is the current index. This invariant indicates that the smallest `p` elements are in their correct position (sorted) at the beginning of the array after `p` iterations of the inner loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0->p-1] = fun(arr[0->p-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    p = 0\n    while p <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = p + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[p]:\n                temp = arr[p]\n                arr[p] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        p += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `selection_sort` function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be described as follows:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant**: `arr[0->i-1] = fun(arr[0->i-1])` where `fun` indicates that the subarray from index 0 to i-1 is sorted in ascending order.\\n\\nNow, I will present three related problems with their descriptions and the corresponding loop invariants:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Find Minimum in Subarray**:\\n   - **Description**: Given an array, find the minimum element in the subarray from index `p` to the end of the array.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant**: `min_value = fun(arr[p->z])` where `min_value` is the smallest value found in the subarray from index `p` to `z` after each iteration of the inner loop.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Swap Elements in Array**:\\n   - **Description**: Given an array, swap elements at two specified indices.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant**: `arr[index1], arr[index2] = fun(arr[index1], arr[index2])` after each swap operation, indicating that the elements at `index1` and `index2` have been exchanged.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Linear Search**:\\n   - **Description**: Given an array and a target value, find the index of the target value in the array if it exists.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant**: `found_index = fun(arr[0->z])` where `found_index` is either the index at which the target is found, or some indication that the target is not present in the array after each iteration of the loop.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem of the `selection_sort` algorithm, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\\n\\n- **Selection Sort Loop Invariant**: `arr[0->i-1] = fun(arr[0->i-1])` where `fun` indicates that the subarray from index 0 to i-1 contains the smallest `i` elements from the original array in sorted order.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0->i-1] = fun(arr[0->i-1])`\""}]
