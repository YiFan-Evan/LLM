This invariant states that the first i elements are sorted after the i-th iteration.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Insertion Sort**\\n   - Description: Sort an array using the insertion sort algorithm, where each iteration takes an element from the unsorted portion and finds its correct position in the sorted portion.\\n   - Solution: The loop invariant for insertion sort at the i-th iteration could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`. This invariant indicates that after the i-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Merge Sort**\\n   - Description: Sort an array using the merge sort algorithm, which is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\\n   - Solution: The loop invariant for merge sort at the i-th iteration could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0:i]`. This invariant implies that after the i-th recursive call, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem of selection sort, the loop invariant can be described as:\\n`min_value = fun(arr[l+1:z])`. This invariant implies that after the i-th iteration of the inner while loop, the smallest element in the unsorted subarray arr[l+1:z]` is at the index `z`. \\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: min_value = fun(arr[l+1:z])`.

This invariant implies that if the target has been found in the subarray `arr[0:i]`, `found_index_value` will hold the index at which it was found.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Swap Elements**\\n   - Description: Write a function that swaps two elements in an array given their indices.\\n   - Solution: Since this is a single operation and not a loop, there isn't a traditional loop invariant. However, if we consider the operation within a loop that iterates over pairs of elements, the invariant could be: `swapped_value = fun(arr[i], arr[j])`, where after the i-th iteration, the elements at indices `i` and `j` have been swapped if they met the swap condition.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem of the `selection_sort` function, the loop invariant can be described as:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[l+1:z+1])`\\n\\nThis invariant implies that after the i-th iteration of the inner while loop, the smallest element in the unsorted subarray `arr[l+1:z+1]` (note that `z` is inclusive in the original code, hence `z+1`) has been found and is at the index `z`. The value at index `l` has been set to this minimum value, ensuring that the subarray `arr[0:l]` is sorted after each outer loop iteration.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `min_value = fun(arr[l+1:z+1])`.\""}]
