In each iteration of the outer loop, the largest unsorted element is moved to its correct position.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `arr[0->i] = fun(arr[0->i-1]->arr[i])` where `i` is the index of the last unsorted element after each iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Insertion Sort**\\n   - **Description:** Perform an insertion sort on an array. This involves building a sorted list one element at a time, taking each element from the input data and inserting it into its correct position within the sorted list.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `arr[0->i] = fun(arr[0->i-1]->arr[i])` where `i` is the index of the current element being placed in the sorted portion of the array.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Quick Sort**\\n   - **Description:** Implement the quick sort algorithm, which sorts an array by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `arr[pivot_left->pivot_right] = fun(arr[pivot_left->pivot_right]->pivot)` where `pivot_left` and `pivot_right` are the indices that define the current sub-array being sorted, and `pivot` is the chosen pivot element.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem of the selection sort algorithm:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant:** After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array has been moved to the beginning of the unsorted portion. Therefore, the invariant for the selection sort algorithm can be stated as:\\n  `arr[0->i] = fun(arr[0->len(arr)-1]->arr[i])`\\n\\n  Here, `i` represents the current index of the outer loop, which tracks how many elements have been moved to their correct position. The function `fun` represents the property that the smallest element from the unsorted portion (from index `i` to the end of the array) has been placed at the beginning of that unsorted portion (index `i`).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0->i] = fun(arr[0->len(arr)-1]->arr[i])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    while q <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = q + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[q]:\n                temp = arr[q]\n                arr[q] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided selection sort algorithm, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant:** `arr[0->q-1] = fun(arr[0->len(arr)-1]->arr[q-1])`\\n\\nHere, `q` represents the current index of the outer loop.
