The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant for bubble sort could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0...i-1]->arr[0...i])` after each iteration of the outer loop, where `i` is the current iteration index of the outer loop.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2: Selection Sort**\\n   - **Description**: Implement a selection sort algorithm that sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant for selection sort could be: `min_value = fun(arr[0...i]->arr[i])` after each iteration of the outer loop, where `i` is the current iteration index, indicating that the minimum value has been placed at position `i`.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3: Merge Sort**\\n   - **Description**: Implement a merge sort algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant for merge sort (if we were to write one for the merge step) could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[low...mid]->arr[mid+1...high])` after merging, where `low` and `high` are the indices defining the current sub-array being merged, and `mid` is the midpoint.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant at the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0...i-1]->arr[0...i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the sub-array `arr[0...i-1]` is sorted. The reason for stopping at `i-1` is that the current element `arr[i]` has not yet been placed in its correct position within the sorted sub-array during the i-th iteration.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0...i-1]->arr[0...i-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = 0\n    while l <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        l += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Apologies for the oversight in the previous response. There was a mistake in the provided code snippet; the variable `i` is not defined within the function. I will assume that there is a typo and that `l` should be `i` in the inner while loop.

The element at `arr[i]` has not yet been moved into this sorted sub-array but will be in the correct position after the inner loop completes.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0...i-1]->arr[0...i-1])`\""}]
