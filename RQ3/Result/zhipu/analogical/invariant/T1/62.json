If the `target` is not found, return -1.\\n   - **Solution Code:**\\n     ```python\\n     def find_first_occurrence(arr, target):\\n         index = -1\\n         for i in range(len(arr)):\\n             if arr[i] == target:\\n                 index = i\\n                 break\\n         return index\\n     ```\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `index_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])` where `i` is the current index in the loop.

The variable `i` is being used instead of `c` to assign the index value when the target is found, and the loop condition should be `c < len(arr)` instead of `c <= len(arr) - 1` for clarity and consistency with typical loop conditions in Python. Assuming the code is corrected to use `c` instead of `i` and the proper loop condition, here are three related problems, their descriptions, and their solutions, followed by the loop invariant for the corrected original problem:\\n\\n1. **Find Index of Target in Array**:\\n   - **Problem Description:** Given an array `arr` and a `target` value, find the index of the first occurrence of the `target` in `arr`.

The code needs to be corrected to use `c` when setting `id_value`.\\n- **Corrected Code:**\\n  ```python\\n  def give_id(arr, target):\\n      id_value = -1\\n      c = 0\\n      while c < len(arr):\\n          if arr[c] == target:\\n              id_value = c\\n              break\\n          c += 1\\n      return id_value\\n  ```\\n- **Loop Invariant for the Original Problem:** `id_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[c])` where `c` is the current index in the loop.
