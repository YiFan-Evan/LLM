The algorithm iteratively takes an element from the unsorted portion and finds its correct position in the sorted portion.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[i])` for `i`-th iteration of the loop, meaning that after each iteration, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Counting Sort**\\n   - **Description:** Implement counting sort, a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that sorts the elements of an array by counting the number of occurrences of each unique element in the array.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `counted_value = count(arr[0]->arr[i])` for `i`-th iteration of the loop, where `count()` is a hypothetical function that counts occurrences of elements, indicating that after each iteration, the count for each element up to the current index `i` is accurate.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the selection sort algorithm:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant for Selection Sort:** `min_value = min(arr[a+1]->arr[n])` for the `i`-th iteration of the outer loop, where `a` is the current index of the outer loop, `n` is the length of the array, and `min()` refers to the minimum value in the unsorted portion of the array. This invariant holds because, after each iteration of the outer loop, the minimum value in the unsorted portion has been placed at the beginning of that unsorted portion (index `a`), ensuring that the subarray `arr[0]->arr[a]` is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`min_value = min(arr[a+1]->arr[n])` for the `i`-th iteration of the outer loop.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    a = 0\n    while a <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = a + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[a]:\n                temp = arr[a]\n                arr[a] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        a += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided selection sort algorithm, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant for Selection Sort:** `arr[a-1] = min(arr[0]->arr[a-1])` for the i-th iteration, where `a` is the index of the current iteration of the outer loop.
