This invariant states that after i iterations of the outer loop, the first i elements are sorted.\\n\\n2. **Selection Sort Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm, where each iteration of the outer loop selects the minimum element from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first unsorted element.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant for selection sort at the i-th iteration could be: `min_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`. This invariant states that after i iterations of the outer loop, the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array has been moved to the beginning of that part.\\n\\n3. **Merge Sort Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant for merge sort at the i-th division (assuming we count divisions rather than iterations) could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[mid]) + fun(arr[mid+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])`. This invariant states that after i divisions, the subarrays from the start to mid and from mid+1 to the end are sorted.\\n\\nNow, let's address the original problem with the insertion sort algorithm provided:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm at the i-th iteration can be stated as:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant implies that after i iterations of the outer loop, the first i elements of the array are sorted. The variable `g` is used to iterate over the array, and for each position `g`, the inner while loop (`z`) ensures that the element at position `g` is placed in the correct position within the sorted portion of the array (from 0 to `g-1`).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    g = 0\n    while g <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        g += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Apologies for the confusion in the previous response. The code snippet you provided contains a typo: the variable `i` is used but not defined within the function. Assuming the intent is to use the variable `g` consistently throughout the function, here are the related problems and the loop invariant for the corrected code:\\n\\n1. **Related Problem 1 - Sequential Search Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that searches for the first occurrence of a target value in an array and returns its index. If the target is not found, return -1.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant for sequential search at the i-th iteration could be: `searched_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`. This invariant states that after i iterations, the first i elements have been checked for the target value.\\n\\n2. **Related Problem 2 - Count Elements Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of a specific value in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant for counting at the i-th iteration could be: `count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`. This invariant states that after i iterations, the count of the specific value in the first i elements has been computed.\\n\\n3. **Related Problem 3 - Find Maximum Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that finds the maximum value in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant for finding the maximum at the i-th iteration could be: `max_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`. This invariant states that after i iterations, the maximum value in the first i elements has been identified.\\n\\nNow, for the corrected insertion sort code provided:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm at the g-th iteration (correcting the variable name from `i` to `g` as it is used in the code) can be stated as:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g])`\\n\\nThis invariant implies that after g iterations of the outer loop, the first g elements of the array are sorted. The variable `g` is used to iterate over the array, and for each position `g`, the inner while loop (`z`) ensures that the element at position `g` is placed in the correct position within the sorted portion of the array (from 0 to `g-1`).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g])`\""}]
