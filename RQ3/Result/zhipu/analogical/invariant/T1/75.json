If `target` is not found, return `-1`.\\n   - **Solution Code:**\\n     ```python\\n     def find_first_occurrence(arr, target):\\n         id_value = -1\\n         p = 0\\n         while p < len(arr):\\n             if arr[p] == target:\\n                 id_value = p\\n                 break\\n             p += 1\\n         return id_value\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Count the Occurrences of a Target in an Array**\\n   - **Problem Description:** Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, count the number of times `target` appears in `arr`.\\n   - **Solution Code:**\\n     ```python\\n     def count_occurrences(arr, target):\\n         count = 0\\n         p = 0\\n         while p < len(arr):\\n             if arr[p] == target:\\n                 count += 1\\n             p += 1\\n         return count\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Sum of All Even Numbers in an Array**\\n   - **Problem Description:** Given an array `arr`, calculate the sum of all even numbers in the array.\\n   - **Solution Code:**\\n     ```python\\n     def sum_of_evens(arr):\\n         total = 0\\n         p = 0\\n         while p < len(arr):\\n             if arr[p] % 2 == 0:\\n                 total += arr[p]\\n             p += 1\\n         return total\\n     ```\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, the loop invariant at the i-th iteration would be:\\n\\n- `id_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n  \\nThis invariant states that `id_value` holds the index of the first occurrence of `target` found in the subarray from the start up to but not including the current index `i`.

If `target` is found, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.\\n   - **Solution Code:**\\n     ```python\\n     def element_present(arr, target):\\n         p = 0\\n         while p < len(arr):\\n             if arr[p] == target:\\n                 return True\\n             p += 1\\n         return False\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Find the Minimum Value in an Array**:\\n   - **Problem Description:** Given an array `arr`, find the minimum value in the array.\\n   - **Solution Code:**\\n     ```python\\n     def find_min(arr):\\n         min_value = arr[0]\\n         p = 1\\n         while p < len(arr):\\n             if arr[p] < min_value:\\n                 min_value = arr[p]\\n             p += 1\\n         return min_value\\n     ```\\n\\nFor the original problem, the loop invariant at the i-th iteration should capture the property that `id_value` is `-1` if the target has not been found in the first `p` elements of the array, or it holds the index of the first occurrence of `target` found so far.\\n\\nHowever, there is a mistake in the original code: it assigns the loop variable `i` to `id_value` when the target is found, but `i` is not defined anywhere in the code. The correct variable to use is `p`. The loop invariant should be:\\n\\n- `id_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `id_value` is the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the subarray from the start up to the element before `p`, or `-1` if the target has not been found yet.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`id_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`\""}]
