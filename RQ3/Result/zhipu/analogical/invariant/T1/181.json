The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant for bubble sort at the i-th iteration could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`. This states that after i iterations of the outer loop, the first i elements are sorted.\\n\\n2. **Insertion Sort Problem**:\\n   - **Description**: Write a function that performs insertion sort on an array. Insertion sort iterates over an array, growing a sorted sublist behind the current location.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant for insertion sort at the i-th iteration could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`. This indicates that after i iterations, the subarray consisting of the first i+1 elements is sorted.\\n\\n3. **Merge Sort Problem**:\\n   - **Description**: Develop a merge sort algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant for merge sort is not as straightforward to express in the specified format because merge sort is a recursive algorithm, but a similar statement could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n])` after the merge step for a subarray of length n.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the selection sort algorithm, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration is:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[b]->arr[i])`\\n\\nThis states that after i iterations of the inner loop, the minimum value in the unsorted portion of the array (from index b to i) has been found and placed at the beginning of the unsorted portion (at index b).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`min_value = fun(arr[b]->arr[i])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    b = 0\n    while b <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = b + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[b]:\n                temp = arr[b]\n                arr[b] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        b += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `selection_sort` function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- **Related Problem 1**: **Find Minimum in Subarray**:\\n  - **Description**: Write a function to find the minimum element in a subarray of an array.\\n  - **Solution**: The loop invariant could be: `min_found_value = fun(arr[b]->arr[i])`, which indicates that after i iterations of the inner loop, the minimum value in the subarray from index b to i (exclusive of i in this case) has been found.\\n\\n- **Related Problem 2**: **Swap Elements**:\\n  - **Description**: Write a function to swap two elements in an array given their indices.\\n  - **Solution**: The loop invariant could be: `elements_swapped = fun(arr[swap_index_1]->arr[swap_index_2])`, which indicates that after the swap operation, the elements at the given indices have been exchanged.\\n\\n- **Related Problem 3**: **Iterative Minimum Selection**:\\n  - **Description**: Write a function that iteratively selects the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the beginning of the unsorted section.\\n  - **Solution**: The loop invariant could be: `min_placed = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`, which indicates that the minimum element from the unsorted part up to the i-th position has been placed at the beginning of the unsorted section.\\n\\nFor the original problem, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `b` is the index of the current position being sorted) is:\\n\\n`min_value_placed = fun(arr[0]->arr[b])`\\n\\nThis states that after b iterations of the outer loop, the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the array (from index b to the end of the array) has been found and placed at the beginning of this unsorted portion (at index b).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`min_value_placed = fun(arr[0]->arr[b])`\""}]
