Iterate through the array, and if a negative number is found, set the variable to this number and break the loop.

Iterate through the array, and if a number is even, add it to the sum. Return the sum after the loop.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `sum_even_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])` where `sum_even_value` is the cumulative sum of even numbers found in the array up to the i-th index.\\n\\n3. **Count of Positive Numbers:**\\n   - **Problem Description:** Count how many numbers in an array are positive.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a count variable to 0.

If the index is out of bounds, return a default value (e.g., -1).\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable to hold the default value. Iterate through the array using a loop.

If the array is empty, return a default value (e.g., -1).\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable to hold the first element of the array or the default value if the array is empty. Iterate through the array using a loop. If a smaller element is found, update the variable.
