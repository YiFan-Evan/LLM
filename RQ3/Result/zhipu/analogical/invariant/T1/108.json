[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

Problem: Find the sum of all elements in an array.\\n   Description: Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of all its elements.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable to store the sum, iterate over the array adding each element to the sum, and return the sum after the loop.\\n   Loop Invariant: `sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n2.
