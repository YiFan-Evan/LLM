There was a mistake in the provided code snippet; the variable `i` is not defined before it is used.

If not, append it to the list.\\n\\n   Loop Invariant: `unique_elements_value = unique(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n3. **Problem: Calculate Average**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that calculates the average of all elements in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a sum variable and a count variable. Iterate through the array, adding each element to the sum and incrementing the count. Divide the sum by the count to get the average.\\n\\n   Loop Invariant: `average_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i]) / (i + 1)`\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the corrected insertion sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm states that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted. This is because the algorithm iteratively places the next element (starting from `arr[1]`) into its correct position within the sorted subarray `arr[0:i-1]`.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as:\\n\\n`sorted_subarray_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds because each iteration of the outer loop ensures that the first i+1 elements are sorted, with the i-th element being placed in its correct position within the sorted subarray of the first i elements.\\n\\nSo, the final answer is:\\n\\n`Therefore, the final answer is: sorted_subarray_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[i])`\""}]
