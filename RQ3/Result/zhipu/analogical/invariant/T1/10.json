[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Iterate through the array, and for each element, if it is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` with this element's value.\\n\\n2. **Sum of Array Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that calculates the sum of all elements in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable `sum_value` to 0.
