[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should reflect that the `min_value` is the minimum value found in the elements from the start of the array up to and including the current index `n`.\\n\\nSo, the correct loop invariant for the original problem is:\\n\\n`min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[n])` for `0 <= n <= len(arr) - 1`.\""}]
