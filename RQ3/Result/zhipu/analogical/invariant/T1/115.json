If the current element matches the target value, store the index and break the loop. If the loop completes without finding the value, return -1.\\n\\n2. **Sum of Elements Until a Certain Index:**\\n   - **Problem Description:** Write a function that calculates the sum of array elements up to a given index.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a sum variable to 0 and iterate through the array, adding each element to the sum until the specified index is reached.\\n\\n3. **Count of a Value in an Array:**\\n   - **Problem Description:** Write a function that counts how many times a specific value appears in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a counter to 0 and iterate through the array, incrementing the counter each time the current element is equal to the target value.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, here is the loop invariant for the `give_member` function at the i-th iteration:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant:**\\n  `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` where `fun` is a function that returns -1 if the index has not been found yet (since `member_value` is initialized to -1 and only changes if the index matches `id`).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    p = 0\n    while p <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if p == id:\n            member_value = arr[p]\n        p += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"\\\"Here are three related but not identical problems:\\n\\n1. **Search for Element by Index:** \\n   - **Problem Description:** Write a function that returns the value at a specific index in an array.
