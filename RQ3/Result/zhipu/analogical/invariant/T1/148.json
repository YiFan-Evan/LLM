Here are three related problems, each with a brief description and their respective solutions:\\n\\n1. **Sum of Array Elements (Given Code)**:\\n   - Problem: Write a function to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.\\n   - Solution: Initialize a variable `sum_value` to 0. Iterate over each element in the array using a loop, adding each element to `sum_value`.
