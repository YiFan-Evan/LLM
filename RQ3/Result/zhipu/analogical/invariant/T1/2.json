[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

For the given `find_max` function, the loop invariant would more accurately be stated as:\\n\\n`max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[c-1])`\\n\\nThis is because `c` is incremented at the end of each iteration, so the invariant should reflect the state of the array up to the current index `c-1` at the start of the next iteration. However, since the problem asks for the format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can stick to the provided format while understanding that it refers to the state at the beginning of each iteration.\""}]
