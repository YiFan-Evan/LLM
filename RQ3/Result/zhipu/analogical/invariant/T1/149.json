[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: Calculate the product of all elements in an array.\\n   Description: Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the product of all the elements.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable to hold the product (e.g., `product_value`). Iterate through the array, multiplying the product by each element. Increment the index until the end of the array is reached.\\n\\n   Loop Invariant: `product_value = prod(arr[0]->arr[j-1])`\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the maximum value in an array.\\n   Description: Write a function that finds and returns the maximum value in an array of numbers.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable to hold the maximum value (e.g., `max_value`) with the first element of the array. Iterate through the array, updating the maximum value if a larger element is found.
