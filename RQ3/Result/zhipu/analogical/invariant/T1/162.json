The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `sorted portion = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` for the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\n2. **Selection Sort Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Perform a selection sort on an array to sort it in ascending order.\\n   - **Solution:** The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `min_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[n-1])` for the i-th iteration of the outer loop, where `n` is the length of the array.\\n\\n3. **Merge Sort Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Implement the merge sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.\\n   - **Solution:** Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `sorted = fun(left_half->right_half)` for each merge step, where `left_half` and `right_half` are subarrays being merged.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the insertion sort algorithm provided, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- **Insertion Sort Loop Invariant:**\\n  - `sorted portion = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` for the i-th iteration of the outer loop, indicating that the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted after i iterations.\\n\\nHowever, there is a mistake in the provided code.

Let's correct the analysis for the given insertion sort code. Here are three related problems:\\n\\n1. **Selection Sort Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Sort an array using the selection sort algorithm.\\n   - **Solution:** Selection sort finds the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the element at the beginning of the unsorted part, then moves the boundary of the sorted part one element to the right.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `min_index_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[n-1])` for the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\n2. **Shell Sort Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Perform a shell sort on an array to sort it in ascending order.\\n   - **Solution:** Shell sort is a generalized version of insertion sort. It allows the exchange of items that are far apart, which significantly reduces the amount of inversions required for sorting.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `h-sorted = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-1])` for the h-th iteration of the outer loop, where `h` is the current gap size.\\n\\n3. **Heap Sort Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Sort an array using the heap sort algorithm.\\n   - **Solution:** Heap sort involves building a max heap from the input data, then iteratively removing the largest element from the heap and placing it at the end of the array, reducing the heap size each time.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `heap_property = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` for the i-th iteration of the loop that maintains the heap property after removing the root.\\n\\nNow, for the original insertion sort code provided, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\\n\\n- **Insertion Sort Loop Invariant:** `sorted_portion = fun(arr[0]->arr[c-1])` for the c-th iteration of the outer loop, which indicates that the subarray `arr[0:c]` is sorted after c iterations, where `c` starts at 0 and increments by 1 after each iteration.\\n\\nHowever, the variable `i` is not defined in the given code snippet.
