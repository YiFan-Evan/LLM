However, at each merge step, an invariant could be: `sorted_value = left_half->right_half`, meaning that the two halves of the array being merged are sorted before the merge operation.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, which is the insertion sort algorithm provided, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\\n\\n`sorted_value = arr[0]->arr[e-1]`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after the i-th (or e-th) iteration of the outer loop, the sub-array from the start of the array up to the element at index e-1 is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = arr[0]->arr[e-1]`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"It seems there is a mistake in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is used in the line `z = i`, but `i` is not defined within the given context. It appears that the variable `e` should be used instead of `i` to maintain the logic of the insertion sort algorithm. Assuming that `i` is a typo and should be `e`, let's provide the related problems and the loop invariant for the corrected code.\\n\\nHere are three related but not identical problems:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Bubble Sort with Invariant**\\n   - **Description:** Write a bubble sort function and provide a loop invariant that holds true after each pass of the inner loop.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant could be: `sorted_value = arr[0]->arr[n-i-1]`, where `n` is the length of the array and `i` is the current iteration of the outer loop. This invariant indicates that after each pass, the last `i` elements are sorted.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Selection Sort with Invariant**\\n   - **Description:** Write a selection sort function and provide a loop invariant that holds true after each selection of the minimum element.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant could be: `min_value = arr[i]->arr[n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the array and `i` is the current iteration of the outer loop. This invariant states that the smallest element from the unsorted part has been moved to its correct position at the beginning of the unsorted section.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Recursive Binary Search with Invariant**\\n   - **Description:** Write a recursive binary search function and provide a loop invariant that describes the state of the array and search range at each recursive call.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant could be: `search_range_value = arr[low]->arr[high]`, where `low` and `high` are the current bounds of the search range. This invariant indicates that the search is confined within the sub-array that could contain the target element.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the corrected variable `e` in the insertion sort algorithm, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\\n\\n`sorted_value = arr[0]->arr[e-1]`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after the e-th iteration of the outer loop, the sub-array from the start of the array up to the element at index e-1 is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = arr[0]->arr[e-1]`\""}]
