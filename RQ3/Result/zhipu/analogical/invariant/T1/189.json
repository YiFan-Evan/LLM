This means that after i iterations, the first i elements are sorted.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Insertion Sort**\\n   - **Description**: Write a function that performs insertion sort on an array. It builds the final sorted array one item at a time by taking each element from the input data and inserting it into the correct position in a new sorted list.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant for insertion sort at the i-th iteration could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`. This means that the subarray consisting of the first i+1 elements is sorted after the i-th iteration.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer)**\\n   - **Description**: Create a merge sort algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\\n   - **Solution**: For merge sort, since it is a recursive algorithm rather than a loop-based one, the loop invariant concept doesn't directly apply. However, the invariant after each recursive call could be: `sorted_value = fun(left_half_of_arr) and sorted_value = fun(right_half_of_arr)`, indicating that each half of the array is sorted.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, the selection sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the selection sort algorithm at the i-th iteration is:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\\n\\nThis means that after i iterations, the minimum value from the unsorted portion of the array has been placed at the beginning of the unsorted portion, and the subarray `arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1]` still contains the elements that have not yet been placed in their correct position.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`min_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    j = 0\n    while j <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = j + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[j]:\n                temp = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        j += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `selection_sort` function, the purpose of the loop is to sort the array in ascending order by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning of the unsorted part.\\n\\nHere are three related but not identical problems, each with a description and its solution:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Find Minimum Element**\\n   - **Description**: Write a function that finds the minimum element in an unsorted array.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant could be: `min_value = fun(arr[j]->arr[len(arr)-1])`. This means that at the i-th iteration, `min_value` holds the minimum value of the unsorted subarray starting from index j to the end of the array.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Swap Elements**\\n   - **Description**: Implement a function that swaps two elements in an array given their indices.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant could be: `swapped_value = fun(arr[old_index], arr[new_index])`. This indicates that the values at the specified indices have been swapped.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Linear Search**\\n   - **Description**: Write a function that searches for a target value in an array and returns its index if found.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant could be: `searched_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`. This means that the function has searched through the first i elements of the array without finding the target.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, the selection sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the selection sort algorithm at the i-th iteration is:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after i iterations, the first i elements of the array `arr` are sorted. The variable `j` represents the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts of the array, and with each iteration of the outer loop, one more element is moved from the unsorted to the sorted part.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\""}]
