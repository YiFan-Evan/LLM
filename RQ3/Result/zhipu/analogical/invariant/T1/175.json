Before providing the loop invariant for the given `insertion_sort` function, let's consider three related problems:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Array Summation**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that calculates the sum of all elements in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable to hold the sum, iterate through the array, and add each element to the sum.\\n\\n   - **LoopInvariant:** `sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n2. **Problem: Find Minimum**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that finds the minimum value in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable to hold the minimum value as the first element of the array, then iterate through the array, updating the minimum value if a smaller element is found.\\n\\n   - **LoopInvariant:** `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n3. **Problem: Reverse Array**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that reverses the elements of an array in place.\\n   - **Solution:** Use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array, and swap the elements at these pointers, then move the pointers towards the center until they meet or cross.\\n\\n   - **LoopInvariant:** `reversed_value = reverse(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, the `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner while loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- **LoopInvariant:** `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[p])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray from the start up to the current position `p` (exclusive) is sorted.

Let's correct the analysis for the given `insertion_sort` function with the proper variable `i` replaced by `p` as it seems to be a typo.\\n\\nHere are three related problems:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Linear Search**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that searches for a target value in an array and returns its index if found.\\n   - **Solution:** Iterate through the array, comparing each element with the target value until a match is found or the end of the array is reached.\\n   - **LoopInvariant:** `search_value = found(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n2. **Problem: Count Elements**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that counts the number of occurrences of a specific value in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a counter to zero and iterate through the array, incrementing the counter each time the specific value is encountered.\\n   - **LoopInvariant:** `count_value = count(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n3. **Problem: Remove Duplicates**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that removes duplicate elements from an array, preserving the order of the first occurrence of each element.\\n   - **Solution:** Iterate through the array and add each element to a new list only if it has not already been added.\\n   - **LoopInvariant:** `unique_value = unique(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, the `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner while loop is:\\n\\n- **LoopInvariant:** `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[p])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray from index 0 to index `p-1` (inclusive) is sorted. The variable `z` is used to move elements to their correct position within the sorted subarray.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[p])`\\n\\nHowever, since the outer loop variable is `p` and it is incremented after the inner loop finishes, the correct loop invariant for the outer loop would be:\\n\\n- **LoopInvariant:** `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[p-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds true after each iteration of the outer loop, indicating that the subarray up to index `p-1` is sorted.\""}]
