Repeat this process until no swaps are needed, indicating that the array is sorted.\\n\\n   Loop invariant for bubble sort: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0...i-1]->arr[i...len(arr)-1])`\\n\\n2. **Selection Sort**:\\n   - **Problem Description**: Implement a selection sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.\\n   - **Solution**: Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array, then swap it with the first unsorted element.

The inner loop then inserts the `j`-th element into the correct position within this sorted sub-array, ensuring that `arr[0...j]` is sorted after the inner loop completes.
