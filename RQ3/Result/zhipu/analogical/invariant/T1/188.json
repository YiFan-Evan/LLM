The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `arr[0->i-1] = sorted(arr[0->i-1])` for the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Insertion Sort**\\n   - **Description:** Write an insertion sort function that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `arr[0->i] = sorted(arr[0->i])` for the i-th iteration of the loop after placing the current element in its correct position.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Merge Sort (Divide and Conquer Approach)**\\n   - **Description:** Create a function that uses the merge sort algorithm to sort an array. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** Since merge sort does not have a single loop with iterations like the other sorting algorithms mentioned, it doesn't have a loop invariant in the specified format. However, a related invariant could be `left_half_sorted = sorted(arr[low->mid])` and `right_half_sorted = sorted(arr[mid+1->high])` after the split, where `merge` function is called to merge the sorted halves.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, which is the selection sort algorithm:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant for Selection Sort:** `arr[0->i-1] = sorted(arr[0->i-1])` for the i-th iteration of the outer loop, indicating that the subarray from the start up to the current index i-1 is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0->i-1] = sorted(arr[0->i-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `selection_sort` function, the loop invariant should describe the state of the array as the algorithm progresses through each iteration of the outer loop.
