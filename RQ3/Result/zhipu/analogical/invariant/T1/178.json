Let's correct the loop invariant for the provided `insertion_sort` function. Here are three related problems with their descriptions and loop invariants:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Count Negative Numbers**\\n   - **Description:** Given an array `arr`, count the number of negative numbers in the array.\\n   - **LoopInvariant:** `negative_count = count(arr[0]->arr[i])` for each iteration, where `i` is the current index, and `negative_count` is the number of negative numbers found up to index `i`.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Find the Average of Elements**\\n   - **Description:** Given an array `arr`, compute the average of its elements.\\n   - **LoopInvariant:** `average_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i]) / (i + 1)` for each iteration, where `i` is the current index, and `average_value` is the average of elements from index `0` to `i`.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Remove Duplicates**\\n   - **Description:** Given an array `arr`, remove any duplicate elements, preserving the order of the first occurrences.\\n   - **LoopInvariant:** `unique_elements = set(arr[0]->arr[i])` for each iteration, where `i` is the current index, and `unique_elements` is the set of unique elements encountered from index `0` to `i`.\\n\\nNow, for the original `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant should capture the fact that the subarray from the start up to the current index `s` is sorted after each iteration of the outer loop. There is indeed a typo in the original code; the variable `i` should be `s` in the inner loop. Here's the correct loop invariant for the `insertion_sort` function:\\n\\n- **LoopInvariant:** `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[s])` for each iteration of the outer loop, where `s` is the current index of the outer loop, and `fun` indicates that the subarray from index `0` to `s` is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[s])`\""}]
