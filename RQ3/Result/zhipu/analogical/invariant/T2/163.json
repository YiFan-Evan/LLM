Iterate through the array, updating the minimum value if a smaller element is found.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n3. **Problem: Reverse Array**\\n   - **Description**: Write a program to reverse the elements of an array.\\n   - **Solution**: Use two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the array.
