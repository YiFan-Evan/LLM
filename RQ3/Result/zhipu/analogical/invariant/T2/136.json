[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

However, the loop and the return statement have logical issues. The loop increments `q` until `2 * q` is no longer less than the length of the array, but it does not correctly find the middle value.
