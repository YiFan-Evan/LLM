Insertion sort iterates through an input list, taking one element at a time and inserting it into its correct position within a sorted subsection of the list.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `sorted_value = arr[0->j]` where `j` is the index up to which elements have been sorted in the current iteration.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Merge Sort**\\n   - **Description:** Create a merge sort function that uses a divide-and-conquer approach to sort an array. The array is divided into halves, each of which is sorted, and then merged back together in a sorted manner.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** Since merge sort is a recursive algorithm, the loop invariant is not typically expressed in the same way because it does not have a single loop. However, if we consider the merging phase, a loop invariant could be `merged_value = merge(arr[low->mid], arr[mid+1->high])` where `merge` represents the merging of two sorted subarrays.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the selection sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the selection sort algorithm can be stated as follows:\\n\\n`min_value = arr[l->min_index]` where `min_index` is the index of the smallest element found so far in the unsorted section of the array.
