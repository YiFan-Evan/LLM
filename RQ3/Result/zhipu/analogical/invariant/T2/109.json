Iterate through each element in the array, and if the current element is less than `min_value`, update `min_value` with the current element's value.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[i])` for the i-th iteration.\\n\\n2. **Sum of Elements Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Calculate the sum of all elements in an integer array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable `sum_value` to 0. Iterate through each element in the array, adding the current element to `sum_value`.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i])` for the i-th iteration.\\n\\n3. **Count Even Numbers Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Count the number of even integers in a given array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable `even_count` to 0.
