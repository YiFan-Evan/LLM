Let's address the corrected insertion sort function provided. The variable `i` is indeed not defined in the code snippet, so we'll assume that it is a mistake and the correct variable should be `r` which is used in the outer loop.\\n\\nHere are three related problems with their descriptions and solutions:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Count Elements Less Than X**\\n   - **Description:** Write a program to count the number of elements in an array that are less than a given value X.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a counter to zero, iterate through the array, and increment the counter for each element less than X.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `count_less_than_x = count(arr[0...r] < X)`\\n\\n2. **Problem: Remove Duplicates**\\n   - **Description:** Write a program to remove duplicate elements from an array, preserving the order of the first occurrences.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize an empty list to store unique elements, iterate through the original array, and append elements to the new list if they haven't been added before.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `unique_prefix = len(set(arr[0...r])) = len(new_arr[0...r])`\\n\\n3. **Problem: Shift Elements**\\n   - **Description:** Write a program to shift all elements of an array to the right by one position and place the last element at the beginning.\\n   - **Solution:** Store the last element in a temporary variable, iterate through the array from the end to the beginning, shifting each element one position to the right, and then place the temporary variable at the first position.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `shifted_prefix = arr[1...r+1] = arr[0...r]`\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, the corrected insertion sort function, the loop invariant for the outer loop `r` would be:\\n\\nLoop invariant for the outer loop: `sorted_prefix_r = sorted(arr[0...r+1])`\\n\\nFor the inner loop, which uses the variable `z`, the loop invariant would be:\\n\\nLoop invariant for the inner loop: `arr[z...r+1] = sorted(arr[z...r+1])`\\n\\nHowever, since `z` is decremented within the loop and `r` is incremented after the inner loop, we need to express the loop invariant just before the inner loop modifies the array:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `arr[z...r+1] = sorted(arr[z...r+1])` before the inner loop's swap operation takes place. Note that `r` is incremented at the end of the outer loop, so the loop invariant should reflect the current state of `r` at the start of each iteration of the inner loop.\""}]
