[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

Let's first look at three related problems and their solutions:\\n\\n1. **Find the First Negative Number in an Array:**\\n   - Problem: Given an array of integers, find the index of the first negative number.\\n   - Solution: Iterate through the array and return the index of the first negative number encountered.\\n   - Loop Invariant: `first_negative_index_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])` where `i` is the current index and `first_negative_index_value` is the index of the first negative number found so far.\\n\\n2. **Sum of Array Elements:**\\n   - Problem: Calculate the sum of all elements in an array.\\n   - Solution: Initialize a sum variable to zero, then iterate through the array, adding each element to the sum.\\n   - Loop Invariant: `sum_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])` where `i` is the current index and `sum_value` is the sum of the array elements processed so far.\\n\\n3. **Find the Maximum Element in an Array:**\\n   - Problem: Find the maximum element in an array.\\n   - Solution: Initialize a variable to hold the maximum value and iterate through the array, updating the maximum value if a larger element is found.\\n   - Loop Invariant: `max_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])` where `i` is the current index and `max_value` is the maximum value found in the array elements processed so far.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, we have the function `give_member(arr, id)` which is supposed to return the value at the index `id` in the array `arr`.
