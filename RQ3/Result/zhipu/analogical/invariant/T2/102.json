If it does, the function returns the value at that index.\\n   - **Loop Invariant**: `element_at_index_value = arr[0->c]` (This invariant assumes that if the loop has iterated `c` times, the value at the `c`-th position has been checked, and if `c` equals the target index, `element_at_index_value` would hold the value at that index.)\\n\\n2. **Problem 2: Count Occurrences**\\n   - **Description**: Write a function that counts the number of times a specific element appears in an array.\\n   - **Solution**: The function iterates over the array, incrementing a count for each time the target element is encountered.\\n   - **Loop Invariant**: `element_count_value = fun(arr[0->c]->element)` (This invariant assumes that after `c` iterations, `element_count_value` holds the count of the occurrences of `element` in the first `c` elements of the array.)\\n\\n3. **Problem 3: Find Minimum Value**\\n   - **Description**: Write a function that finds the minimum value in an array.\\n   - **Solution**: The function iterates over the array, updating the minimum value found so far with each iteration.\\n   - **Loop Invariant**: `current_min_value = fun(min(arr[0->c]->arr[c]))` (This invariant assumes that after `c` iterations, `current_min_value` holds the minimum value found in the first `c` elements of the array.)\\n\\nFor the original problem:\\n\\n**Loop Invariant**: `member_value = fun(arr[0->c]->arr[c])` for the `i`-th iteration, which can be written as `member_value = fun(arr[0->i]->arr[i])`.
