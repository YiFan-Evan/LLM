Iterate through the array, and if a positive integer is found, set the variable to that value and break the loop. Return the variable.\\n\\n   Loop Invariant: `first_positive_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[a])` where `first_positive_value` is either -1 or the value of the first positive integer encountered in the array up to the a-th index.\\n\\n2. **Sum of Even Numbers:**\\n   - Problem Description: Given an array of integers, calculate and return the sum of all even numbers in the array.\\n   - Solution: Initialize a sum variable to 0. Iterate through the array, and if an even number is encountered, add it to the sum. Return the sum.\\n\\n   Loop Invariant: `even_sum_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[a])` where `even_sum_value` is the sum of all even numbers in the array up to the a-th index.\\n\\n3. **Count of Specific Element:**\\n   - Problem Description: Given an array of integers and a specific element `x`, count and return the number of times `x` appears in the array.\\n   - Solution: Initialize a count variable to 0.
