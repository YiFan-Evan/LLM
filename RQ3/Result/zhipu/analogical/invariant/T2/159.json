[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: Calculate the product of all elements in an array.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable `product_value` to 1. Iterate through each element of the array, multiplying `product_value` by the current element. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be `product_value = product(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the maximum value in an array.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable `max_value` to the first element of the array. Iterate through the array, updating `max_value` if the current element is greater than `max_value`. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be `max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`.\\n\\n3. Problem: Count the number of even elements in an array.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable `even_count` to 0. Iterate through the array, incrementing `even_count` each time the current element is even. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be `even_count = count_even(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`.\\n\\nFor the original problem provided, the purpose is to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.
