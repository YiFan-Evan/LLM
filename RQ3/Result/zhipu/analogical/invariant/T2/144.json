The loop invariant for the i-th iteration can be stated as follows:\\n\\n`sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds true before the i-th iteration because `sum_value` has accumulated the sum of the array elements from index 0 up to, but not including, the current index `i`. After the i-th iteration (which actually processes the element at index `i-1` due to the initial value of `e`), `sum_value` will then include the element at index `i-1`, maintaining the invariant.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\""}]
