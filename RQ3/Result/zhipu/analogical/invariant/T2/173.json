After each iteration of the outer loop, the largest unsorted element is bubbled to its correct position, ensuring that the first `i` elements are sorted.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Selection Sort**\\n   - Description: Implement the Selection Sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.\\n   - Solution: The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the Selection Sort algorithm can be stated as `min_index_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1], min_index)`, where `min_index` is the index of the smallest element found in the unsorted part of the array. After each iteration, the smallest element from the unsorted part is moved to its correct position at the beginning of the unsorted part.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Reverse Array**\\n   - Description: Write a function to reverse the elements of an array.\\n   - Solution: The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of a reversing array algorithm can be stated as `reversed_prefix_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-i-1])`. After each iteration, the elements from the start and end of the array are swapped, moving towards the center of the array.\\n\\nNow, let's analyze the given `insertion_sort` function and provide a loop invariant for it:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the `insertion_sort` function can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray from the start of `arr` to the element at index `i-1` is sorted. Note that the original code provided contains a typo (the variable `i` is not defined before the inner while loop). Assuming that the variable `i` should be `n`, the loop invariant would be:\\n\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-1])`\\n\\nAfter each iteration of the outer loop, the element at index `n` is placed in its correct position within the sorted subarray `arr[0]->arr[n-1]`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"temp\\nThere is a typo in the code snippet you provided. The variable `i` is referenced in the line `z = i` but it is not defined within the scope of the function. It seems that `i` should be `n` instead, as `n` is the variable that is incremented in the outer while loop. Let's correct the code first and then provide the related problems and the loop invariant for the corrected code.\\n\\nCorrected code:\\n```python\\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\\n    n = -1\\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\\n        n += 1\\n        z = n\\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\\n            temp = arr[z]\\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\\n            z -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's identify three related problems:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Bubble Sort**\\n   - Description: Sort an array using the Bubble Sort algorithm, where adjacent elements are compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order.\\n   - Solution: The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of Bubble Sort can be stated as `bubble_sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Selection Sort**\\n   - Description: Sort an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.\\n   - Solution: The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of Selection Sort can be stated as `selection_sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1], min_index)`.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Merge Sort**\\n   - Description: Sort an array using the Merge Sort algorithm, which divides the array into halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.\\n   - Solution: The loop invariant for the recursive step of Merge Sort can be stated as `merge_sorted_subarrays_value = fun(left_subarray, right_subarray)`.\\n\\nFor the corrected `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration is:\\n\\n- `insertion_sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after the i-th (or n-th, in this case) iteration of the outer loop, the subarray from the start of `arr` to the element at index `n` is sorted according to the insertion sort algorithm.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`insertion_sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n])`\""}]
