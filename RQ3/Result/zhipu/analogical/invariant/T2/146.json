Here are three related problems:\\n\\n1. **Sum of Array Elements (given code)**: The function `give_sum(arr)` calculates the sum of all elements in the array `arr`. The loop iterates through each element of the array and adds it to `sum_value`.\\n\\n   - Loop invariant for the i-th iteration: `partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n   - This invariant holds because at each iteration, `partial_sum_value` represents the sum of the elements from the start of the array up to but not including the current element `arr[i]`.\\n\\n2. **Count of Array Elements**: Write a function that counts the number of elements in an array. The loop would iterate through the array, incrementing a counter for each element.\\n\\n   - Loop invariant for the i-th iteration: `count_value = len(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n   - This invariant holds because at each iteration, `count_value` represents the number of elements from the start of the array up to but not including the current element.\\n\\n3. **Product of Array Elements**: Write a function that calculates the product of all elements in an array. The loop would iterate through each element of the array and multiply it with a running product.\\n\\n   - Loop invariant for the i-th iteration: `partial_product_value = prod(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n   - Here, `prod` is a function that calculates the product of elements.

The loop would iterate through the array, assigning the value to each element.\\n\\n   - Loop invariant for the i-th iteration: `assigned_value = arr[0->arr[i-1]] = value`\\n   - This invariant indicates that at each iteration, the elements from the start up to the current index `i-1` have been assigned a specific `value`.\\n\\n3. **Find Maximum Element**: Write a function that finds the maximum element in an array. The loop would iterate through the array, comparing each element to the current maximum and updating it if a larger element is found.\\n\\n   - Loop invariant for the i-th iteration: `max_value = max(arr[0->arr[i-1]])`\\n   - This invariant states that `max_value` holds the maximum value found in the array from the start up to the current index `i-1`.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the `give_sum` function is:\\n\\n- Loop invariant for the i-th iteration: `sum_value = sum(arr[0->arr[g]])`\\n- This invariant holds because at each iteration, `sum_value` accumulates the sum of the array elements from the start up to the current index `g` (inclusive, since `g` starts at `-1` and we are looking at `arr[0->arr[g]]` which means from the start to the element at index `g`).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sum_value = sum(arr[0->arr[g]])`\""}]
