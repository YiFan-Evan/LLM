However, a loop invariant-like statement could be `sorted_subarrays = merge_sort(arr[0..mid])->arr[0..mid]` and `sorted_subarrays = merge_sort(arr[mid+1..end])->arr[mid+1..end]` before merging in the recursive calls.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop (which is not explicitly named but uses the variable `z`) would be:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant for Inner Loop:** `sorted portion = insertion_sort(arr[0..z-1])->arr[0..z-1]`\\n\\nAnd for the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant for Outer Loop:** `sorted portion = insertion_sort(arr[0..p])->arr[0..p]`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted portion = insertion_sort(arr[0..p])->arr[0..p]`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = -1\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        p += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"It appears there is a mistake in the provided code snippet.
