The variable `i` is not defined within the context of the function `insertion_sort`. It appears that there might have been a mix-up between the loop counter variable `k` and `i`. Let's assume that the loop counter should be `k` instead of `i` in the inner while loop. Here's the corrected code:\\n\\n```python\\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\\n    k = -1\\n    while k < len(arr) - 1:\\n        k += 1\\n        z = k  # Starting from the current position of k\\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\\n            temp = arr[z]\\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\\n            z -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's provide three related problems, their descriptions, and their solutions, and then find the loop invariant for the corrected insertion sort algorithm.\\n\\n1. Problem: Reverse an array.\\n   Description: Given an array, reverse the order of its elements.\\n   Solution: Use two pointers approach to swap elements from start to end until the pointers meet.\\n   Loop invariant: `reversed_arr = reverse(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the minimum value in an array.\\n   Description: Given an array of numbers, find the minimum value in the array.\\n   Solution: Iterate through the array, keeping track of the minimum value found so far.\\n   Loop invariant: `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n3. Problem: Remove duplicates from a sorted array.\\n   Description: Given a sorted array, remove all duplicate elements.\\n   Solution: Iterate through the array and copy only the unique elements to a new array.\\n   Loop invariant: `unique_arr = unique(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nFor the corrected insertion sort algorithm, the loop invariant for the k-th iteration of the outer loop would be:\\n\\n`sorted_subarray = sorted(arr[0]->arr[k])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after `k` iterations of the outer loop, the sub-array `arr[0:k+1]` (since `k` is zero-based and we're including the current element being placed in its correct position) is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_subarray = sorted(arr[0]->arr[k])`\""}]
