Assuming that `i` should be a typo and is meant to represent `l`, which is the loop variable initialized to `-1` and incremented at the beginning of the outer while loop, let's identify three related problems and their solutions, followed by the loop invariant for the corrected insertion sort algorithm.\\n\\n1. **Problem: Find Minimum in Subarray**\\n   - **Description:** Write a program that finds the minimum value in a subarray of an array.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant could be: `min_value = fun(subarray[0]->subarray[i])` where `subarray` is the portion of the array being considered, and `i` is the current index in the subarray.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Reverse Array**\\n   - **Description:** Write a program that reverses the elements of an array.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant for the reversal process could be: `reversed_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])` where after each iteration, the elements from the start up to the current index `i` are in reversed order compared to the original array.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Linear Search**\\n   - **Description:** Implement a linear search algorithm to find the index of a given element in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant could be: `searched_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])` indicating that the elements up to index `i` have been checked for the target value.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the insertion sort algorithm, here is the loop invariant:\\n\\n- **Insertion Sort Loop Invariant:**\\n  - The loop invariant for the outer while loop at the i-th iteration is that the subarray `arr[0:l]` (where `l` is the current value of the loop variable) is sorted.\\n  - The loop invariant for the inner while loop at the i-th iteration could be: `sorted_subarray_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l])`. This states that after the inner while loop has completed for a particular `l`, the subarray `arr[0:l]` is sorted, and the element `arr[l]` has been placed in its correct position within this sorted subarray.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_subarray_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l])`.\""}]
