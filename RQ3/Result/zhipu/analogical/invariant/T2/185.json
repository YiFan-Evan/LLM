Problem: Implement a function to find the maximum element in an array.\\n   Description: Write a function that returns the maximum element from an array.\\n   Solution:\\n   ```python\\n   def find_max(arr):\\n       max_element = arr[0]\\n       for i in range(1, len(arr)):\\n           if arr[i] > max_element:\\n               max_element = arr[i]\\n       return max_element\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Problem: Implement a function to shift elements of an array to the right.\\n   Description: Write a function that shifts all elements of an array to the right by one position, with the last element moving to the front.\\n   Solution:\\n   ```python\\n   def shift_right(arr):\\n       if not arr:\\n           return arr\\n       last_element = arr.pop()\\n       arr.insert(0, last_element)\\n       return arr\\n   ```\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the modified selection sort algorithm, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\\n\\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[f])` where `fun` is a function that indicates that the subarray `arr[0:f]` is sorted after the i-th iteration, and `f` is the current index of the outer loop.\\n\\nSince the initial value of `f` is `-1` and it is incremented to `0` before the first comparison, the loop invariant for the first iteration would actually be:\\n\\n- `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[0])` which is trivially true as a single element is considered sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[f])` for the outer loop, where `fun` implies that the subarray `arr[0:f]` is sorted, and `f` is the index at the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\""}]
