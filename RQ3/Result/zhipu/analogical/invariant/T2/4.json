Here are three related problems, their descriptions, and solutions:\\n\\n1. **Find Minimum Value**:\\n   - Problem Description: Write a function to find the minimum value in an array of integers.\\n   - Solution: Initialize a variable `min_value` to the first element of the array. Iterate over the array, and if a smaller value than `min_value` is found, update `min_value`.
