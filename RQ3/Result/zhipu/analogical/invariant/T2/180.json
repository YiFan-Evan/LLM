It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `arr[0->i] = fun(arr[0->i]->arr[i+1])` for the i-th iteration of the loop, meaning that after i iterations, the subarray from index 0 to i is sorted.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Merge Sort**\\n   - **Description:** Create a merge sort function that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `left[0->i] = fun(left[0->i]->right[0->j])` and `right[0->j] = fun(right[0->j]->left[0->i])` after the merge step, indicating that the left and right subarrays are sorted before merging.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the selection sort algorithm:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant:** `arr[0->a-1] = fun(arr[0->a-1]->arr[a])` for the i-th iteration (where i is represented by 'a' in the given code), which means that the subarray from index 0 to a-1 contains the smallest elements found in the array up to index a and is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0->a-1] = fun(arr[0->a-1]->arr[a])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    a = -1\n    while a < len(arr) - 1:\n        a += 1\n        z = a + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[a]:\n                temp = arr[a]\n                arr[a] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the given `selection_sort` function, the loop invariant should describe the property that holds true before the start of each iteration of the outer while loop.
