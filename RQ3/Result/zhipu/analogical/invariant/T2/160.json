Problem: **Bubble Sort**\\n   Description: Sort an array using the bubble sort algorithm.\\n   Solution: Iterate through the array, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. Repeat this process until the array is sorted.\\n   Loop Invariant: `sorted_value = arr[0->i-1]` after the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\n2.

Problem: **Merge Sort**\\n   Description: Sort an array using the merge sort algorithm.\\n   Solution: Recursively divide the array into halves, sort each half, and then merge the sorted halves.\\n   Loop Invariant: This algorithm does not have a simple loop invariant in the same sense as insertion sort because it is a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm. However, we can say that `left_half_sorted = arr[0->mid]` and `right_half_sorted = arr[mid+1->end]` after each merge step, where `mid` is the midpoint of the current subarray being sorted.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the insertion sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe insertion sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted part and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part.\\n\\nLoop Invariant for the insertion sort code provided (correcting the variable name from `i` to `z` which is actually used in the code):\\n\\n`sorted_value = arr[0->a-1]` after the a-th iteration of the outer loop, indicating that the first a elements are sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = arr[0->a-1]`.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    a = -1\n    while a < len(arr) - 1:\n        a += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There seems to be a mistake in the provided code. The variable `i` is used in the inner while loop but it is not defined within the function.
