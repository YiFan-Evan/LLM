Iterate through the array, and for each element, if it is greater than the current maximum, update the maximum with the current element's value.\\n\\n2. **Sum of Array Elements:**\\n   - **Problem Description:** Compute the sum of all elements in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a sum variable to zero. Iterate through each element of the array, adding each element's value to the sum.\\n\\n3. **Count Even Numbers:**\\n   - **Problem Description:** Count how many even numbers are in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a count variable to zero.

The function `fun` here can be thought of as a function that keeps the value of `member_value` unchanged unless the current index `l` equals `id`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l])` where `fun` is the function that maintains the value of `member_value` as -1 until `l` equals `id`. This invariant holds because `member_value` remains -1 until the loop index `l` matches the `id`, at which point `member_value` is set to `arr[id]`. Since `l` is initialized to -1 and incremented at the start of each iteration, the invariant holds true for each iteration until `l` reaches `id`.\""}]
