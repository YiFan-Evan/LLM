Let's consider three related problems that involve sorting or ordering elements, each with a brief description and its solution:\\n\\n1. **Bubble Sort**:\\n   - **Problem Description**: Sort an array using the bubble sort algorithm, which repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant for bubble sort at the i-th iteration could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`, indicating that the subarray from the start to the i-th element is sorted after i iterations.\\n\\n2. **Selection Sort**:\\n   - **Problem Description**: Sort an array using the selection sort algorithm, which divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant for selection sort at the i-th iteration could be: `min_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`, indicating that the minimum value from the unsorted part has been placed at the beginning of the unsorted part after i iterations.\\n\\n3. **Merge Sort**:\\n   - **Problem Description**: Sort an array using the merge sort algorithm, which is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\\n   - **Solution**: The loop invariant for merge sort is not as straightforward since it's a recursive algorithm, but at each merge step, we could say: `sorted_value = fun(left_half->right_half)`, indicating that the subarrays passed to the merge function are sorted.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant should describe the property that holds true after each iteration of the outer loop. Here's the loop invariant for the `insertion_sort` algorithm:\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant**: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n  \\n  This invariant states that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray from the start of the array up to the element before `i` (inclusive) is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        i += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant needs to capture the property that holds true after each iteration of the outer loop.
