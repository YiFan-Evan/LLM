This invariant states that the sub-array from the start up to the element before i is sorted.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Selection Sort**\\n   - **Description:** Implement a function that sorts an array using the selection sort algorithm, which divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant for selection sort at the i-th iteration could be: `min_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`. This invariant states that the minimum value from the unsorted part of the array is correctly placed at the beginning of the unsorted part.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Merge Sort**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that sorts an array using the merge sort algorithm, which is a divide and conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant for merge sort is not as straightforward to express in the specified format because merge sort is a recursive algorithm, but if we were to describe the state of the array after each merge step, it could be: `sorted_value = fun(merge_sort(arr[0]->arr[mid]), merge_sort(arr[mid+1]->arr[len(arr)-1]))`. This invariant states that the array is sorted after each merge operation.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem which involves the insertion sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm at the i-th iteration can be stated as follows:\\n\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after i iterations of the outer loop, the sub-array from the start of the array up to the i-th element is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    s = -1\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\n        s += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"It seems there is a mistake in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is used in the while loop but it is neither defined nor updated within the loop. Assuming that `i` should be a typo and was meant to be `z`, let's correct the code and then provide the loop invariants for the corrected insertion sort algorithm.\\n\\nHere is the corrected code:\\n\\n```python\\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\\n    s = -1\\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\\n        s += 1\\n        z = s\\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\\n            temp = arr[z]\\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\\n            z -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's identify three related problems, their descriptions, and solutions, followed by the loop invariant for the corrected insertion sort:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Binary Insertion Sort**\\n   - **Description:** Modify the insertion sort algorithm to use binary search to find the correct position to insert the element, instead of shifting elements one by one.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant would still be similar to that of insertion sort, stating that after each iteration, the sub-array up to the current index is sorted.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Insertion Sort with Duplicates**\\n   - **Description:** Adapt the insertion sort algorithm to handle an array with duplicate elements without changing the overall sorting order.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant remains the same as in the standard insertion sort, indicating that the sub-array up to the current index is sorted.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Insertion Sort with Custom Comparator**\\n   - **Description:** Extend the insertion sort algorithm to accept a custom comparator function that defines the order of elements.\\n   - **Solution:** The loop invariant would be adjusted to account for the custom comparator, stating that the sub-array up to the current index is sorted according to the custom comparison criteria.\\n\\nNow, for the loop invariant of the corrected insertion sort algorithm at the i-th iteration:\\n\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[s+1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after s+1 iterations of the outer loop, the sub-array from the start of the array up to the element at index s+1 (inclusive) is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[s+1])`\""}]
