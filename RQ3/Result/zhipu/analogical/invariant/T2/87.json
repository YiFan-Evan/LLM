The loop starts with `h = -1` and increments `h` until it reaches `len(arr) - 1`. At each iteration, `last_value` is updated to the current element `arr[h]`.\\n\\n- **Loop Invariant for the original problem:** At the i-th iteration of the while loop, `last_value` holds the value of the last element accessed from the array up to that point. Since `h` starts at `-1` and is incremented to `0` on the first iteration, the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n  - `last_value = arr[h]` for the i-th iteration where `h` is the current index in the loop.\\n\\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** `last_value = arr[h]`\""}]
