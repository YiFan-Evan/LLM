Problem: Calculate the product of all elements in an array.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable to hold the product (e.g., `product_value = 1`). Iterate over each element in the array, multiplying the current product by the current element (`product_value *= arr[i]`), where `i` is the loop index.\\n\\n   Loop Invariant: `product_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` where `fun` is the function that multiplies all elements from the start up to the current element (not including the current element `arr[i]`).\\n\\n2.
