Iterate through the array, and if a smaller element is found, update the minimum variable.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n2. **Problem: Calculate the Sum of Elements**\\n   - **Description:** Write a program to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a sum variable to 0.

The loop invariant for the `insertion_sort` function can be stated as follows:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[l-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after `l` iterations, the subarray from the start to the `l-1` index is sorted.

The variable `i` is not defined within the function, and it's not clear what its initial value should be. Additionally, the variable `l` is initialized with the length of the array but is used as if it were an index. Assuming the intention is to sort the array in descending order and correct the loop to decrement `l` at the beginning of the outer loop, the corrected code might look like this:\\n\\n```python\\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\\n    l = len(arr)\\n    while l > 0:\\n        i = 1  # Assuming `i` should start from 1 as the first element is considered sorted.\\n        while i < l:\\n            z = i\\n            while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\\n                temp = arr[z]\\n                arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\\n                arr[z - 1] = temp\\n                z -= 1\\n            i += 1\\n        l -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nNow, considering the corrected code, here are three related problems with their descriptions and solutions:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Reverse Array**  \\n   - **Description:** Write a program to reverse the elements of an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Use a loop to swap elements from the start and the end until reaching the middle of the array.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `reversed_value = arr[len(arr)-1->arr[i]]`\\n\\n2. **Problem: Bubble Sort**  \\n   - **Description:** Write a program to sort an array using the bubble sort algorithm.\\n   - **Solution:** Iterate through the array multiple times, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0->arr[n-i-1]])` (where `n` is the length of the array and `i` is the current iteration)\\n\\n3. **Problem: Selection Sort**  \\n   - **Description:** Write a program to sort an array using the selection sort algorithm.\\n   - **Solution:** Find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array and swap it with the first unsorted element.\\n\\n   Loop invariant: `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0->arr[i-1]])`\\n\\nFor the original problem with the corrected code, the loop invariant would be:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0->arr[l-1]])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds true at the start of each iteration of the outer while loop, indicating that the subarray from index 0 to `l-1` is sorted.
