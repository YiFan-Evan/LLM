The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\\n\\n   **Solution**: For the i-th iteration of the bubble sort, the loop invariant could be: `sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`. This invariant states that after i iterations, the first i elements are sorted.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Provide a loop invariant for a program that calculates the sum of the first n elements of an array.\\n\\n   **Description**: The program initializes a variable to hold the sum and iterates through the first n elements of the array, adding each element to the sum.\\n\\n   **Solution**: For the i-th iteration of the sum calculation, the loop invariant could be: `sum_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`. This invariant indicates that after i iterations, the sum of the first i elements is correctly computed.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Describe a loop invariant for an algorithm that finds the maximum value in an array.\\n\\n   **Description**: The algorithm iterates through the array, keeping track of the maximum value found so far. At the end of the iteration, the maximum value is determined.\\n\\n   **Solution**: For the i-th iteration of the maximum-finding algorithm, the loop invariant could be: `max_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`.

The variable `i` is used but it is not defined within the given context.

This invariant states that the minimum value from the unsorted part has been placed in its correct position after i iterations.\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: Loop invariant for a program that reverses an array.\\n   - **Description**: The program iterates over the array, swapping elements from the start with the corresponding elements from the end until the entire array is reversed.\\n   - **Solution**: For the i-th iteration, the loop invariant could be: `reversed_part = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`. This invariant states that after i iterations, the elements from the start to the i-th position have been swapped with the elements from the end.\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: Loop invariant for a program that computes the product of all elements in an array.\\n   - **Description**: The program initializes a product variable to 1 and multiplies it by each element in the array in a loop.\\n   - **Solution**: For the i-th iteration, the loop invariant could be: `product_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`. This invariant states that after i iterations, the product of the first i elements is correctly computed.\\n\\nFor the original problem with the corrected insertion sort algorithm, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where i is the index used in the inner while loop) can be described as follows:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0...i]` is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\""}]
