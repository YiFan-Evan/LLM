The variable `i` is not defined within the function, and it appears that the `while` loops are nested but not correctly structured to perform a selection sort. I'll assume you meant to reverse the indices in the loop and correct the variable names to match the standard selection sort algorithm. Here is a corrected version of the code:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    n = len(arr)\\n    for e in range(n):\\n        max_index = e\\n        for z in range(e+1, n):\\n            if arr[z] < arr[max_index]:\\n                max_index = z\\n        arr[e], arr[max_index] = arr[max_index], arr[e]\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's provide three related problems with their descriptions and loop invariants:\\n\\n1.

Problem: Implement a function to count the number of occurrences of a specific value in a list.\\n   Description: The function iterates through the list, incrementing a counter each time it encounters the specific value.\\n   Loop Invariant: `count_value = count(arr[0]->arr[i], target)` for the i-th iteration, where `i` is the current index, `target` is the value being counted, and `count` is a hypothetical function that returns the number of occurrences of `target` in the slice of the array up to index `i`.\\n\\nNow, for the corrected original problem with the selection sort algorithm, the loop invariant would be:\\n\\nLoop Invariant for the selection sort algorithm:\\n`max_value_in_segment_value = max(arr[0]->arr[e-1])` for the e-th iteration, where `e` is the current index of the outer loop, and `max_value_in_segment` represents the largest value found in the unsorted segment of the array from index `0` to `e-1`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`max_value_in_segment_value = max(arr[0]->arr[e-1])`\""}]
