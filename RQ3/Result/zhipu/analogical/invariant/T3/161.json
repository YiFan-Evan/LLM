The variable `i` is not defined before it's used, and the inner while loop should iterate in the opposite direction for the insertion sort algorithm to work correctly.

The loop invariant for the corrected insertion sort algorithm can be stated as follows:\\n\\n`arr[0:b].sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[b-1])`\\n\\nFor each iteration `i` of the outer loop, where `b` is decremented by 1, the following loop invariant holds:\\n\\n`arr[0:i].sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0:i].sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\""}]
