[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Iterate over each element in the array and update `max_value` if a larger value is found.\\n   - Loop invariant: `max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[i])` (for the i-th iteration)\\n\\n2. **Sum of Array Elements:**\\n   - Problem: Write a function `sum_of_elements(arr)` that calculates the sum of all elements in the list `arr`.\\n   - Solution: Initialize `total_sum` to 0.
