However, a similar concept could be that after each merge step, `sorted_value = fun(left_half->right_half)` where 'left_half' and 'right_half' are the subarrays being merged.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, which is the selection sort algorithm, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration is:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the smallest value in the unsorted portion of the array (from index i to the end of the array) has been moved to its correct position at index i.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `min_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[t]:\n                temp = arr[t]\n                arr[t] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"It seems there was a mistake in the provided code snippet.
