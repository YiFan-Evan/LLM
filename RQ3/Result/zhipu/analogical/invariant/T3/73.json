If the target is not present, return `-1`.\\n   - Solution: Iterate over the array using a loop. If the current element matches the target, return the current index.

However, there is a mistake in the code: the variable `i` is used instead of `n` to set `id_value` when the target is found, and also the variable `i` is not defined anywhere in the code.
