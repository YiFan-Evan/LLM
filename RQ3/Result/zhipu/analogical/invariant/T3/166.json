The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\\n   - Loop Invariant: `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` after the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Selection Sort**\\n   - Description: Implement a selection sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.\\n   - Solution: The algorithm divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.\\n   - Loop Invariant: `min_value = fun(min(arr[i]->arr[n-1]))` after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, where `min_value` is the smallest value among the unsorted elements.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Merge Sort**\\n   - Description: Implement a merge sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.\\n   - Solution: The algorithm divides the array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\\n   - Loop Invariant: `sorted_value = fun(merge_sort(arr[l]->arr[m]), merge_sort(arr[m+1]->arr[r]))` after the recursive calls, where `l`, `m`, and `r` are the indices defining the subarrays.\\n\\nNow, let's analyze the original problem, which is an insertion sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm in the provided code snippet can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- Loop Invariant: `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g-1])` after the g-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the original code provided.

Let's address the corrected insertion sort code provided. There is still a mistake in the variable usage within the code snippet; the variable `i` is not defined. Assuming that `i` is a typo and should be `z` or another index variable that starts from the second element of the array and moves inward, here are three related problems and their solutions:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Insertion Sort with Forward Iteration** \\n   - Description: Sort an array using the insertion sort algorithm, but iterate from the start of the array towards the end.\\n   - Solution: Iterate through the array, and for each position, compare it with the elements before it, shifting those elements one position to the right if they are greater than the current element, and inserting the current element in its correct position.\\n   - Loop Invariant: `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` after the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Insertion Sort with Backward Iteration** \\n   - Description: Sort an array using the insertion sort algorithm, but iterate from the end of the array towards the start.\\n   - Solution: Similar to the forward iteration, but the process starts from the last element and moves towards the first element, ensuring that each element is placed in its correct position in the sorted part of the array.\\n   - Loop Invariant: `sorted_suffix_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1])` after the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `i` starts from `len(arr)-1` and decrements).\\n\\n3. **Problem: Shellsort** \\n   - Description: Sort an array using the Shellsort algorithm, which is a generalized version of insertion sort.\\n   - Solution: The algorithm sorts pairs of elements far apart from each other first, then progressively reduces the gap between elements to be compared.\\n   - Loop Invariant: `sorted_gap_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[gap*i], arr[gap*(i+1)->arr[min(gap*(i+1), len(arr)-1)])` after the i-th iteration of the outer loop for a specific gap size.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the corrected loop variable `z`:\\n\\n- Loop Invariant: `sorted_suffix_value = fun(arr[g]->arr[len(arr)-1])` after the g-th iteration of the outer loop. This invariant states that after g iterations, the subarray from index g to the end of the array is sorted.\\n\\nHowever, the code snippet has a logical error because the inner while loop should start at the second-to-last element and move backward, not forward. Assuming the variable `i` is a typo and should be `z` starting from `len(arr) - 2`, the correct loop invariant for the provided insertion sort code would be:\\n\\n- Loop Invariant: `sorted_suffix_value = fun(arr[g-1]->arr[len(arr)-1])` after the g-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_suffix_value = fun(arr[g-1]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\""}]
