Therefore, the loop invariant is:\\n\\n**Final Answer**: `member_value = arr[id]->arr[a]` when `a == id`, otherwise `member_value = -1`. \\n\\nHowever, since `member_value` is only assigned within the loop when `a == id`, and it's initialized to `-1` before the loop, the loop invariant can be simplified to:\\n\\n**Final Answer**: `member_value = arr[0]->arr[a]` when `a == id`, otherwise `member_value = member_value`. \\n\\nThis reflects that `member_value` is either set to the current element when `a` matches `id`, or it retains its previous value (which is `-1` if `id` hasn't been found yet).\""}]
