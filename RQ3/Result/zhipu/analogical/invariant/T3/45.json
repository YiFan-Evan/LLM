However, the notation used in the loop invariant is not standard for describing the state of a loop iteration. A more precise loop invariant might be:\\n\\n`count_value = count(arr[f]->arr[len(arr)-1] == target)` \\n\\nThis states that the `count_value` is equal to the count of elements equal to the target from the current index `f` to the end of the array.\""}]
