Repeat this process until no swaps are needed, indicating the array is sorted.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `sorted portion = arr[0->i-1]` (for the i-th iteration)\\n\\n2. **Problem: Selection Sort**\\n   - **Description:** Sort an array using the selection sort algorithm, which repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted part and moves it to the beginning.\\n   - **Solution:** For each position in the array, find the minimum element in the unsorted part and swap it with the element at the current position.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `min element placed at front = arr[0->i-1]` (for the i-th iteration)\\n\\n3. **Problem: Reverse Array**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function to reverse the elements of an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Use a loop to swap elements from the start of the array with the corresponding elements from the end, moving towards the center of the array.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `reversed portion = arr[0->len(arr)/2-i]` (for the i-th iteration)\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the insertion sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe insertion sort algorithm iteratively takes an element from the array and inserts it into its correct position in a sub-array that is already sorted.

The variable `i` is used but not defined within the function. Additionally, the while loop condition `c > 0` and the inner while loop's increment `z += 1` are not typical for the insertion sort algorithm. However, I will assume that `i` is meant to be the loop index for the outer while loop and correct the code to reflect the standard insertion sort algorithm. \\n\\nHere's the corrected version of the insertion sort function:\\n\\n```python\\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\\n    c = 1  # Start from the second element\\n    while c < len(arr):  # The outer loop should iterate over the array starting from the second element\\n        i = c\\n        while i > 0 and arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:\\n            temp = arr[i]\\n            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]\\n            arr[i - 1] = temp\\n            i -= 1\\n        c += 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's identify three related problems, their descriptions, and solutions, and then provide a loop invariant for the corrected insertion sort algorithm:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Bubble Sort (as previously described)**\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `sorted portion = arr[0->i-1]` (for the i-th iteration)\\n\\n2. **Problem: Selection Sort (as previously described)**\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `min element placed at front = arr[0->i-1]` (for the i-th iteration)\\n\\n3. **Problem: Shift Array Elements**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function to shift all elements of an array to the right by one position and insert a new element at the beginning.\\n   - **Solution:** Start from the end of the array and move each element one position to the right. Insert the new element at the start.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `shifted portion = arr[1->len(arr)-i]` (for the i-th iteration)\\n\\nFor the corrected insertion sort algorithm, the loop invariant would state that after `c` iterations, the sub-array consisting of the first `c` elements is sorted:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`sorted portion = arr[0->c-1]` (for the c-th iteration of the outer while loop)\""}]
