Let's consider three related problems, their descriptions, and their solutions:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Calculate the product of an array**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the product of all the elements in the array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable to hold the product (e.g., `product_value`). Iterate through the array, multiplying the current product by each element. Increment the loop variable after each iteration.\\n\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `product_value = prod(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` for the i-th iteration.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Find the maximum value in an array**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the maximum value found in the array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable to hold the maximum value (e.g., `max_value`) to the first element of the array. Iterate through the array, updating the maximum value if a larger element is found. Increment the loop variable after each iteration.\\n\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` for the i-th iteration.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Count the number of odd numbers in an array**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the count of odd numbers within the array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable to hold the count (e.g., `odd_count`). Iterate through the array, incrementing the count each time an odd number is encountered.

Set the loop variable to the last index of the array and decrement it until it reaches 0.
