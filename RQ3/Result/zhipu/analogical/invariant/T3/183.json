The algorithm builds the final sorted array one item at a time, picking an element from the unsorted part and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n   - At each iteration of the loop, the array from the start to the current index `i` is sorted, as the insertion sort process ensures this by moving elements one by one.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Reverse Array**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function that reverses the elements of an array in place.\\n   - **Solution Loop Invariant:** `reversed_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[d])`\\n   - At each iteration of the loop, the elements from the start up to the index `d` (inclusive) are in reverse order compared to their original positions in the original array.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the `selection_sort` function:\\n\\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\\n\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[d-1])`\\n\\nAt the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `d` is the loop index), the invariant states that the subarray from the start of the array to the index `d-1` is sorted. This invariant holds true because each iteration of the outer loop selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and places it at the beginning of the unsorted part, thereby incrementally building a sorted subarray.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    d = len(arr)\n    while d > 0:\n        d -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[d]:\n                temp = arr[d]\n                arr[d] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"It seems there is a small mistake in the provided code snippet.
