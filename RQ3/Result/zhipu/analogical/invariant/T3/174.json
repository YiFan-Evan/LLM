This process is repeated until the array is sorted.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` for the i-th iteration of the outer loop, indicating that the first i elements are sorted.\\n\\n2. **Selection Sort Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Perform a selection sort on an array to sort it in ascending order.\\n   - **Solution:** The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on the desired order) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the beginning.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `min_value = fun(arr[min_index]->arr[i])` for the i-th iteration of the loop, where min_index is the index of the smallest element found so far.\\n\\n3. **Counting Sort Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Sort an array using counting sort, which is particularly efficient when the range of input data is not significantly greater than the number of objects to be sorted.\\n   - **Solution:** The algorithm counts the number of objects that have each distinct key value, and uses arithmetic to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `counted_values = fun(arr[counted]->arr[n])` for the i-th iteration, where counted represents the number of times an element has been processed and n is the total number of elements.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the insertion sort algorithm, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- **Original Problem Loop Invariant:** `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[o])` for the o-th iteration of the outer loop. This invariant states that after o iterations of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:o]` is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[o])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = len(arr)\n    while o > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        o -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There seems to be a mistake in the code snippet provided. The variable `i` is used in the while loop but it is not defined within the given code. Assuming that `i` is meant to be `o` (which is the typical variable used in the original insertion sort algorithm and is decremented at the end of the outer loop), let's correct the code and provide three related problems, their descriptions, and the loop invariants, followed by the loop invariant for the corrected original problem.\\n\\n1. **Original Insertion Sort Problem (Corrected Code):**\\n   - **Description:** Sort an array in ascending order using the insertion sort algorithm.\\n   - **Solution:** Start from the second element and compare it with the elements before it. Shift all larger elements one position to the right and insert the current element into its correct position.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[o-1])` for the o-th iteration of the outer loop, indicating that the subarray from index 0 to o-1 is sorted.\\n\\nNow, here are three related problems with their descriptions and loop invariants:\\n\\n1. **Original Insertion Sort Problem (with a different index variable):**\\n   - **Description:** Similar to the corrected code, but using a different index variable for clarity.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-i])` where `n` is the length of the array and `i` is the current iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\n2. **Reverse Insertion Sort Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Sort an array in descending order using a modified insertion sort algorithm.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[o-1])` for the o-th iteration of the outer loop, indicating that the subarray from index 0 to o-1 is sorted in descending order.\\n\\n3. **Insertion Sort with Sentinel:**\\n   - **Description:** Implement insertion sort with a sentinel value to avoid the need for a boundary check in the inner loop.\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])` for the i-th iteration of the outer loop, indicating that the subarray from index 0 to i is sorted.\\n\\nNow, for the corrected original problem, the loop invariant is:\\n\\n- **Original Problem Loop Invariant:** `sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[o-1])` for the o-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`sorted_prefix_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[o-1])`\""}]
