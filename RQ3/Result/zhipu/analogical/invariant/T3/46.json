Problem: **Sum of Target Values**\\n   Description: Given an array `arr`, find the sum of all elements that are equal to a specified `target`.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable `sum_value` to 0. Iterate over each element of the array, and if an element is equal to `target`, add it to `sum_value`.
