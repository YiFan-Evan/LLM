The variable `i` is not defined before the inner while loop. Assuming the variable `i` is meant to be the loop variable for the outer while loop, here is the corrected insertion sort code with the loop invariant:\\n\\n```python\\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\\n    n = 0\\n    while n < len(arr):  # for the i-th iteration, n = i\\n        i = n\\n        while i > 0 and arr[i - 1] > arr[i]:\\n            temp = arr[i]\\n            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]\\n            arr[i - 1] = temp\\n            i -= 1\\n        n += 1\\n    return arr\\n# Loop invariant for i-th iteration: arr[0]->arr[n] is sorted\\n```\\n\\nHowever, the loop invariant needs to be in the specified format. Since the format requires expressions like 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we need to adapt the loop invariant to that form. The loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm, in the specified format, would be:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n```\\narr[0]->arr[n] = sorted(arr[0]->arr[n])\\n``` \\n\\nPlease note that the format is slightly adapted to fit the requirement of the question, even though it's not a typical way to express a loop invariant.
