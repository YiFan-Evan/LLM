It is not defined within the context of the `insertion_sort` function. Assuming that `i` is a typo and should be `t` in the inner while loop, and also correcting the loop to decrement `t` rather than increment it, let's present three related problems and their solutions:\\n\\n1. **Problem: Count Even Numbers**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function to count the number of even elements in an array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a counter to zero, then iterate through the array, incrementing the counter for each even element found.\\n   \\n   Loop invariant: `even_count_value = count_even(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n2. **Problem: Remove Duplicates**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function to remove duplicate elements from an array, preserving the order of the original array.\\n   - **Solution:** Iterate through the array, and for each element, check if it has already been added to a new list that will store the unique elements.

Finally, place the original first element at the end.\\n   \\n   Loop invariant: `shifted_value = shift_right(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nNow, let's address the original problem with the corrected loop invariant for the `insertion_sort` function. Assuming the typo is corrected and the loop starts from the end of the array and moves backward, the loop invariant should describe that after each iteration of the outer while loop, the last `t` elements of the array are sorted. Here's the corrected loop invariant:\\n\\nLoop invariant: `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[t-1])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[t-1])`\\n\\n(Note: In the actual `insertion_sort` algorithm, the inner loop performs the necessary shifts to insert the current element into its correct position within the sorted subarray, and the outer loop moves the boundary of the sorted subarray one element at a time from the beginning to the end of the array.)\""}]
