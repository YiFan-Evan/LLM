Iterate through each element of the array, and if any element is greater than `max_value`, update `max_value` with that element.\\n\\n   - **Loop Invariant:** `max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n2. **Problem: Sum of Array Elements**\\n   - **Description:** Write a function `sum_array(arr)` that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of all elements in the array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable `sum_value` to 0.
