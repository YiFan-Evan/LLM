Here are three related problems along with their descriptions and solutions:\\n\\n1. Problem: Calculate the product of all elements in an array.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable to hold the product (e.g., `product_value`). Iterate over the array, multiplying the current product by each element. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be `product_value = product(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the maximum value in an array.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable to hold the maximum value found so far (e.g., `max_value`). Iterate over the array, updating the maximum value if a larger element is encountered. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be `max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`.\\n\\n3. Problem: Count the number of even numbers in an array.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable to hold the count of even numbers (e.g., `even_count`). Iterate over the array, incrementing the count for each even element found. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be `even_count = count_even(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem:\\n\\nThe function `give_sum(arr)` calculates the sum of all elements in an array.

Problem: Calculate the sum of all elements in an array, but start from the end of the array and move towards the beginning.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable to hold the sum (e.g., `sum_value`). Set an index variable to the last index of the array. Iterate in reverse order, decrementing the index each time, and add the current element to the sum. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be `sum_value = sum(arr[len(arr)-i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`.\\n\\n2. Problem: Find the minimum value in an array, iterating from the end to the beginning.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable to hold the minimum value found so far. Set an index variable to the last index of the array. Iterate in reverse order, decrementing the index each time, and update the minimum value if a smaller element is encountered. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be `min_value = min(arr[len(arr)-i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`.\\n\\n3. Problem: Count the number of odd numbers in an array, starting from the last element and moving to the first.\\n   Solution: Initialize a variable to hold the count of odd numbers. Set an index variable to the last index of the array. Iterate in reverse order, decrementing the index each time, and increment the count for each odd element found. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be `odd_count = count_odd(arr[len(arr)-i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the while loop in the `give_sum(arr)` function, which sums the array elements starting from the end, would be:\\n\\n`sum_value = sum(arr[len(arr)-i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `sum_value = sum(arr[len(arr)-i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\""}]
