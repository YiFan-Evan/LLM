The variable `i` is not defined within the context of the `selection_sort` function, and the loop structure is slightly different from the typical selection sort algorithm. However, I will assume that the intention is to sort the array in descending order, and the loop should start from the end of the array and move towards the beginning. Here's a corrected version of the code with the proper loop structure for selection sort in descending order:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    m = len(arr) - 1\\n    while m > 0:\\n        z = m - 1\\n        while z >= 0:\\n            if arr[z] < arr[m]:\\n                temp = arr[m]\\n                arr[m] = arr[z]\\n                arr[z] = temp\\n            z -= 1\\n        m -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's provide three related problems and their solutions, followed by the loop invariant for the original problem.\\n\\n1. **Problem 1**: **Find Maximum in Subarray**\\n   - **Description**: Given an array `arr`, write a function that finds the index of the maximum value in the subarray starting from index `m` to the end of the array.\\n   - **Solution**: Initialize an index `max_index` to `m`. Iterate through the subarray from `m-1` to the beginning of the array. If a larger element is found, update `max_index`. Return `max_index` at the end.\\n   - **Loop Invariant**: `arr[max_index] = max(arr[m->0])`\\n\\n2. **Problem 2**: **Swap Elements**\\n   - **Description**: Given an array `arr` and two indices `i` and `j`, write a function that swaps the elements at these indices.\\n   - **Solution**: Use a temporary variable to hold the value at index `i`, then set the value at index `i` to the value at index `j`, and finally set the value at index `j` to the value stored in the temporary variable.\\n   - **Loop Invariant**: `arr[i] = temp_value and arr[j] = original_arr[i]`\\n\\n3. **Problem 3**: **Sort Descending using Insertion Sort**\\n   - **Description**: Given an array `arr`, write a function that sorts the array in descending order using the insertion sort algorithm.\\n   - **Solution**: Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
