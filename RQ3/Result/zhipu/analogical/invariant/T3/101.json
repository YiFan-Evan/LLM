Iterate through the array, and for each element, if it is less than the current minimum, update the minimum value.\\n\\n   Loop Invariant: `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\n2. **Sum of Elements Problem:**\\n   - **Description:** Given an array of integers, calculate the sum of all elements in the array.\\n   - **Solution:** Initialize a variable to store the sum as 0.
