Let's address the corrected function `give_mid(arr)` provided.\\n\\nThis function appears to be attempting to return the middle element of the array `arr`. However, the loop condition `2 * j < len(arr)` will never be true if `j` is initialized to `len(arr)`, as `2 * len(arr)` will always be greater than `len(arr)`. Therefore, the loop will not execute, and the function will return `arr[0]` regardless of the size of the array.\\n\\nHere are three related problems with their descriptions and solutions:\\n\\n1. **Find the last element of the array**:\\n   - Problem: Write a function that returns the last element of a given array.\\n   - Solution: Simply return the element at index `len(arr) - 1`.\\n   - Loop invariant for the i-th iteration: `last_element_value = arr[len(arr) - 1]`\\n\\n2. **Compute the sum of the array**:\\n   - Problem: Write a function that calculates the sum of all elements in an array.\\n   - Solution: Iterate over all elements of the array, summing them up.\\n   - Loop invariant for the i-th iteration: `total_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i])` where `i` is the current index and `i < len(arr)`\\n\\n3. **Find the middle element of the array**:\\n   - Problem: Write a function that returns the middle element of a given array.\\n   - Solution: If the array has an odd number of elements, return the middle element. If the array has an even number of elements, there is no single middle element, so this is undefined based on the problem statement.\\n   - Loop invariant for the i-th iteration: `middle_element_value = arr[len(arr) // 2]` (assuming the array has an odd length)\\n\\nNow, for the original problem, we need to provide a loop invariant for the given code, although the code is flawed:\\n\\n- Loop invariant for the i-th iteration: `mid_value = arr[j]` where `j` is decremented within the loop but does not reach the actual middle index of the array due to the incorrect loop condition.
