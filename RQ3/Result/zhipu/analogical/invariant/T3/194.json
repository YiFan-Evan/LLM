This states that the subarray from index 0 to i-1 is sorted after the i-th pass of the loop.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Insertion Sort**\\n   - Description: Implement an insertion sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order.\\n   - Solution: The loop invariant for insertion sort at the i-th iteration could be: `arr[0->i]_sorted = fun(arr[0->i])`. This indicates that the subarray from index 0 to i is sorted after the i-th iteration of the loop.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Merge Sort**\\n   - Description: Implement the merge sort algorithm to sort an array in ascending order using a divide-and-conquer approach.\\n   - Solution: For merge sort, the loop invariant is not as straightforward because the algorithm involves recursive calls. However, a loop invariant for the merging process could be: `arr[l->r]_merged = fun(arr[l->m], arr[m+1->r])`, where `l` and `r` are the left and right indices of the subarrays to be merged, and `m` is the middle index.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the selection sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the selection sort algorithm at the i-th iteration is: `arr[0->i-1]_sorted = fun(arr[0->i-1]->arr[i-1])`. This states that the subarray from index 0 to i-1 contains the smallest i elements in sorted order, with the smallest element at index i-1 after the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `arr[0->i-1]_sorted = fun(arr[0->i-1]->arr[i-1])`.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    o = len(arr)\n    while o > 0:\n        o -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[o]:\n                temp = arr[o]\n                arr[o] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"It seems there was a small mistake in the provided code snippet.

This states that the subarray from index i to the end of the array is sorted in descending order after the i-th iteration.\\n\\n2. **Problem: Stability in Sorting**\\n   - Description: Modify the selection sort algorithm to ensure it is stable (i.e., the relative order of equal elements is preserved).\\n   - Solution: The loop invariant for a stable selection sort would be similar to the standard selection sort, but with an emphasis on stability: `arr[0->i-1]_sorted_stable = fun(arr[0->i-1]->arr[i-1])`. This invariant implies that the subarray is sorted and stable up to the i-th iteration.\\n\\n3. **Problem: Selection Sort with a Minimum Comparator**\\n   - Description: Adapt the selection sort algorithm to find the minimum element rather than the maximum in each iteration.\\n   - Solution: The loop invariant for this version of selection sort at the i-th iteration could be: `arr[i->len(arr)-1]_min_selected = fun(arr[i->len(arr)-1]->arr[min_index])`. This indicates that the minimum element in the unsorted subarray has been found and placed at the beginning of the unsorted subarray after the i-th iteration.\\n\\nNow, for the original problem with the corrected selection sort algorithm:\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the selection sort algorithm at the i-th iteration is: `arr[0->len(arr)-i]_sorted = fun(arr[0->len(arr)-i]->arr[len(arr)-i-1])`. This states that the subarray from index 0 to `len(arr)-i` contains the smallest `len(arr)-i` elements in sorted order, with the smallest element at index `len(arr)-i-1` after the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `arr[0->len(arr)-i]_sorted = fun(arr[0->len(arr)-i]->arr[len(arr)-i-1])`.\""}]
