Iterate through the array `arr`, and for each element that equals `target`, add its value to `sum_value`. Return `sum_value` after the loop.\\n\\n2. **First Occurrence Index Problem**\\n   - **Description**: Given an array `arr` and a target value `target`, find the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. If `target` is not found, return -1.\\n   - **Solution**: Initialize an index variable `index_value` to -1 and a loop counter `i` to 0.
