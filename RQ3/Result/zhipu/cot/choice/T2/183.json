Supermarket - While a supermarket might sell poker chips, it is not the most typical place where one would find them in use.\\n\\nB.

Motherboard - A motherboard is a part of a computer and has no relevance to poker chips.\\n\\nD. Bar - Poker chips are often associated with poker games, which can frequently be found in casinos or bars where social gaming occurs. This is a plausible location to find poker chips.\\n\\nE. Bar - This option is identical to option D and also suggests a bar as a place where poker chips might be found.\\n\\nSince both D and E suggest a bar, which is a logical place for a poker game and therefore poker chips, either could be correct.
