Demands that are considered reasonable are more likely to gain public and employer support and are more likely to be met, reducing the need for a strike.\\n\\nB. more money - While unions often negotiate for better pay, simply demanding \\\"more money\\\" without considering other factors such as the employer's ability to pay, inflation rates, and industry standards could be seen as unreasonable and might not lead to a resolution.\\n\\nC. not go to work - This option is self-defeating in the context of the question, as it is the strike action itself (not going to work) that the question seems to imply the unions are already taking. Demanding not to go to work is not a demand but the action of the strike.\\n\\nD. return to work - This would not be a demand the unions would make if they are on strike. This is something an employer might demand from the striking workers.\\n\\nE. union - This option is unclear and seems to be incomplete or not well phrased.

It doesn't make sense as a demand that would lead a union to end a strike.\\n\\nD. more money - While unions often strike to demand better wages, this option alone does not address the broader context of what would lead them to end a strike. The demand itself is for more money, but the question seems to be about what kind of demands would lead them to stop striking.\\n\\nE. reasonable - This is the most logical answer. Unions are more likely to end a strike if their demands are considered reasonable by all parties involved, including the employers and often the public. Reasonable demands are more likely to be met, leading to a resolution and the end of the strike.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: E\""}]
