Park - While some parks may have ticketed events, the general concept of a park does not typically involve buying tickets specifically for seats.\\n\\nB. Show - This is a broad term that could include theater performances, concerts, or other events where seating is assigned and tickets are required to reserve a seat.

Tickets are often required to reserve seats for such events, making this a plausible option as well.\\n\\nD. Movies - Going to see a movie at a cinema typically involves buying a ticket for a seat in the theater. This is a common situation where tickets are purchased specifically for seats.\\n\\nE. Rest area - Rest areas are places where travelers can stop to rest, and they do not typically involve events for which one would buy tickets.\\n\\nConsidering the options, both B (show) and D (movies) are events where one would buy tickets for seats.
