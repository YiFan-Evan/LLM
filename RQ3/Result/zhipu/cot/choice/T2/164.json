Let's examine the options:\\n\\nA. lot of - This phrase indicates a large quantity, which is the opposite of a little.\\nB. big - This term refers to size or magnitude, not quantity.\\nC. more - This indicates an amount greater than what was mentioned but doesn't convey the sense of 'a lot' as directly.\\nD. plenty - This means enough and often implies more than enough, which is a suitable opposite.\\nE. much - This word indicates a large amount and is a direct opposite in terms of quantity.\\n\\nGiven that 'lot of' and 'plenty' both convey the idea of a large quantity, 'plenty' is a more specific term indicating not just a lot but more than enough, which is a stronger opposite to 'a little.' However, 'much' is also a direct opposite and is often used in a similar context.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: E (since 'much' is a direct single-word opposite to 'a little'). However, 'A' (lot of) and 'D' (plenty) could also be considered correct in a broader interpretation.\\\" \\n\\nNote: If the question is looking for a single-word answer and the options are to be taken literally, 'E' (much) would be the most precise single-word opposite.\""}]
