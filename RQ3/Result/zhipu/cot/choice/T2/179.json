It does not typically reach the ocean, so this is an unlikely option.\\n\\nB. cliff - A cliff is a vertical, steep rock face that often borders the ocean. Riding on a plain and then reaching a cliff that meets the ocean is a plausible scenario.\\n\\nC. sandplain - A sandplain is a flat, sandy area.
