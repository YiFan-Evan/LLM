The goal in this context is likely related to the act of listening itself, rather than outcomes like gaining confidence or getting attention, which are more indirect and not directly related to the act of intense listening.\\n\\nA. Gain confidence - This could be a side effect of understanding the material, but it's not a direct goal of intense listening.\\nB. Concentrate - This is a possible goal, as intense listening requires concentration.\\nC. Get attention - Intense listening is about the listener's engagement with the material, not about drawing attention to oneself.\\nD. Pay attention - This is very similar to concentrate and is indeed a goal of listening intensely.\\nE. Stop talking - This is not relevant to the goal of listening to a lecture.\\n\\nBoth B (Concentrate) and D (Pay attention) are valid goals of intense listening.
