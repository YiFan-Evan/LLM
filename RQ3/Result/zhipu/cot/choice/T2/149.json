If he is confused by the questions, he may not be able to answer them well.\\n\\nC. attention - While Zane may not like the attention that comes with answering questions, this doesn't necessarily mean he's not good at it. It's more about his discomfort rather than his ability.\\n\\nD. discussion - This option is vague and doesn't clearly explain why Zane would not be good at answering questions. It's not directly related to the act of answering questions.\\n\\nE. panic - This is a plausible reason for Zane's difficulty. If he panics when answering questions, this could significantly impair his ability to perform well.\\n\\nGiven the context, the most likely reason Zane is not good at answering questions is because he suffers from panic when doing so.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: E\""}]
