Kitchen - While kitchens can have doors, they are not typically the place where you would need to use a key to enter.\\n\\nB. Safe - Safes require keys, but they are not doors one walks through to enter a space.\\n\\nC. Own house - This is a plausible option because many people have doors with locks that require keys to enter their own homes.\\n\\nD. Building - This is also a possibility, especially for office buildings or apartment buildings where there may be secure entries that require keys.\\n\\nE. Pantry - Similar to the kitchen, a pantry is an interior space that doesn't usually require a key for entry.\\n\\nGiven these options, the most likely answer is the one that represents a common entry point requiring a key.
