The scenario describes using a shrink ray but getting the opposite effect. Since a shrink ray is supposed to decrease size, getting it backwards would cause an increase in size. The options that suggest an increase in size are E (\\\"get bigger\\\"), D (\\\"augment\\\"), C (\\\"make larger\\\"), and A (\\\"grow\\\"). All these options can be considered correct in the context of the shrink ray having the opposite effect.
