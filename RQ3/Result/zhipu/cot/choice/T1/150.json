Without thrust, the plane cannot maintain altitude or speed. It will begin to glide, as it has no power to keep climbing or even maintain level flight. The term for this is not that the plane \\\"stalls\\\" in the aerodynamic sense (which would imply a loss of lift due to angle of attack), but rather it will glide or possibly \\\"dive\\\" depending on the plane's altitude and configuration at the time of engine failure. However, if the engines cannot be restarted and the plane cannot glide to a safe landing area, it will eventually crash due to the lack of lift and forward motion.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. crash\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\nOptions: E. speed up D. crash C. taxi B. start melting A. stall"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The question is a repeat of the previous one, and the explanation remains the same.
