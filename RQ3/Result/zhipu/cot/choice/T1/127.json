However, machines can perform certain types of work that are beyond human capabilities, such as lifting extremely heavy objects or operating continuously without rest.\\n\\nC. answering questions - Humans can answer questions, and so can machines, especially AI systems like me which are designed for that purpose.\\n\\nD. see work - This option is a bit vague, but if we interpret \\\"see work\\\" as performing work involving vision, humans can see and perform visual tasks. Machines can also \\\"see\\\" using cameras and computer vision, and in some cases, they can \\\"see\\\" better than humans (e.g., with night vision or through different spectrums).\\n\\nE. fly - While humans cannot naturally fly, we have developed technology that allows us to fly using aircraft. Machines, on the other hand, can be designed to fly autonomously, such as drones and some military aircraft.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, the most accurate answer is that machines can perform work that is beyond human physical capabilities or endurance.

They can also perform calculations and process data much faster than humans.\\n\\nA. fail to work - Both humans and machines can fail to work. This is not an ability unique to machines.\\n\\nGiven these points, the ability to fly is something that machines can do autonomously without a human pilot, which is a capability that humans themselves do not possess.
