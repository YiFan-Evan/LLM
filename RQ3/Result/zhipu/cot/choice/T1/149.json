If Zane doesn't get satisfaction from answering questions, it might explain his dislike, but not his ineptitude.\\n\\nBetween A and D, both are reasonable, but \\\"panic\\\" (A) is more commonly associated with an inability to perform well in situations like answering questions due to anxiety or nervousness.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: A\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Zane doesn't like answering questions.

Let's analyze the options again:\\n\\nE. satisfaction - If Zane lacks satisfaction, it might explain why he doesn't like answering questions, but it doesn't necessarily explain why he's not good at it.\\n\\nD. confusion - If Zane is confused, it could indeed hinder his ability to answer questions effectively, as confusion can make it difficult to understand or process the questions being asked.\\n\\nC. attention - If Zane dislikes attention, it might make him uncomfortable when answering questions, but it doesn't directly explain why he would be bad at it.\\n\\nB. discussion - This option is vague and doesn't specifically address why Zane would be incompetent at answering questions.\\n\\nA. panic - If Zane panics when answering questions, this would likely impair his performance, as panic can lead to a blank mind or nervousness that disrupts clear thinking and communication.\\n\\nBased on the options provided, \\\"panic\\\" (A) is the most directly related to the performance aspect of answering questions.
