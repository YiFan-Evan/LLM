Truck stop - While truck stops are located along highways and offer services to travelers, including truckers who may need maps, they are not the most universally reliable place for finding a map.\\n\\nB. Amusement park - This is not a place one would typically find along the road while lost, as amusement parks are generally destinations in themselves and not known for providing maps for road travelers.\\n\\nC. Atlas - An atlas is a collection of maps, but it is not a place. This option is therefore not valid in the context of the question.\\n\\nD. Mall - Malls are large shopping centers that can be found off the road, but they are not specifically designed to cater to travelers who might be lost on the road.\\n\\nE. Gas station - Gas stations are commonly found along roads and highways and are known for providing services to travelers, including maps or directions.
