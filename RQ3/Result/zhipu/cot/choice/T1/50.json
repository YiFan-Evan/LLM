Considering the options provided:\\n\\nA. Michigan - While there are lakes in Michigan, they are not glacial in origin; they are primarily the result of glacial activity but are not located in an area where current glacial processes are shaping the landscape.\\n\\nB. New York - New York state has lakes, but the term \\\"glacial\\\" refers to lakes formed by or in the presence of glaciers. There are no current glaciers in New York that would create glacial lakes.\\n\\nC. New York - This option is a duplicate of B and carries the same reasoning.\\n\\nD. Mountains - This is the most logical choice. Glaciers are found in mountainous regions, and glacial lakes are often formed in the basins left behind by receding glaciers.\\n\\nE.
