Reasonable demands are more likely to be taken seriously and can lead to a resolution that satisfies both the union and the employer.\\n\\nB. more money - While unions often negotiate for better pay, this option is too narrow. It doesn't account for other possible demands such as better working conditions, benefits, or workplace safety, which could also be reasons for a strike.\\n\\nC. not go to work - This option is actually the definition of a strike, not a demand. It's what unions do when they want to negotiate, not what they demand.\\n\\nD. return to work - This would not be a demand the union would make to go off strike. This would be a condition that the employer might set for ending a strike.\\n\\nE. union - This option is unclear and seems to be a non-sequitur.
