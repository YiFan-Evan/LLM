If friends need help, the most direct and practical actions would involve coordination and communication to provide support.\\n\\nA. Call each other - This is a plausible option because friends might start by calling each other to offer or request help.\\n\\nB.

Part company - This is the opposite of what friends would do if they need each other's help; they wouldn't separate.\\n\\nGiven these considerations, the most logical action for friends in need of each other's help is to communicate.
