Effectiveness - Learning can improve effectiveness, but effectiveness is not a direct result of the act of learning itself; it's more of a potential indirect outcome.\\n\\nC. Knowing more - This is a direct result of learning. The process of learning is generally about gaining knowledge or skills, so this is a likely outcome.\\n\\nD. Head grows larger - This option is metaphorical and not literal. While one might joke about the \\\"head growing larger\\\" due to increased knowledge, it is not a literal or direct outcome of learning.\\n\\nE.
