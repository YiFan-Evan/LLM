Park - Generally, parks do not require tickets for seating; they are public spaces where people can sit without purchasing tickets.\\n\\nB. Show - This is a broad option that could include theater shows, concerts, or other performances where tickets are commonly purchased to reserve seats.\\n\\nC. Auditorium - An auditorium is a venue where events such as concerts, lectures, or presentations take place, and tickets are often required to secure seats.\\n\\nD. Movies - Going to the cinema involves buying tickets for specific seats in a movie theater.\\n\\nE. Rest Area - A rest area, typically found along highways, is a place for travelers to take a break and is not an event that requires tickets for seating.\\n\\nConsidering the typical context where tickets are purchased for seats, both B (show), C (auditorium), and D (movies) are valid options.
