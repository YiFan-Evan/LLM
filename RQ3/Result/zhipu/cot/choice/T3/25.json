This implies that he is likely moving from place to place without a personal means of transportation, such as a car.\\n\\nA. Library - While a library is a place where one might carry a bag, it doesn't inherently explain the need for a duffel bag due to lack of a vehicle.\\nB. Transit - This is a general term for various forms of public transportation, which makes sense in the context of someone without a vehicle needing to carry their belongings while commuting.\\nC. Bus station - This is a specific place where one might use public transportation, but it's not the action itself.\\nD. Army barracks - This is a specific location that doesn't necessarily relate to the scenario of needing a bag due to a lack of vehicle unless James is in the military, which is not indicated.\\nE. Locker room - This is a place where one might change clothes or store items in a locker, but it doesn't explain the need for a duffel bag due to not having a vehicle.\\n\\nThe most logical choice is B.
