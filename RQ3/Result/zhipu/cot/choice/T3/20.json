Mars - While this would indeed mean having no neighbors on the planet, currently living on Mars is not feasible for the average person due to the technological, logistical, and financial challenges.\\nD. Woods - This option suggests a more secluded and natural environment where one could potentially live away from other people.\\nE. Suburbs - Suburban areas generally have a lower density of housing compared to cities, but they still have neighbors.\\n\\nConsidering the options, the most practical and feasible choice for someone who wants to live without neighbors would be the woods, as it represents a natural setting with the possibility of isolation from other human inhabitants.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: D.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where would a person live if they wanted no neighbors?
