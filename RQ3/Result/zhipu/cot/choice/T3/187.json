University - This is a plausible location for all these items, as they are commonly used in an academic setting.\\nC. Drawer - A drawer could contain any of these items, but it is unlikely to contain all of them at once, especially not the computers.\\nD. Table - A table is a broad and vague option. While it's true that these items might all be found on a table at some point, it is not a specific place like a university or a workplace.\\nE.
