(Since the model found words such as \"endorsee\" and \"beginning\", it suggests that the individual has recently received payment for their work or services. In addition, the model may have taken into account any potential limitations or restrictions on how the money can be spent, indicated by the word \"limitations\". The model may also consider the individual's desire to embrace a new age and make positive change, as suggested by the word \"new_age\".
