Freeway - Cars often travel at high speeds on freeways, which are designed for fast travel over long distances.\\n\\nB. Road - This is a broad category. While some roads may have high speed limits, others do not, so it's not specific enough to conclude that all cars travel at high speeds on all roads.\\n\\nC. Race track - Cars are specifically designed to travel at very high speeds on race tracks, which are built for racing events.\\n\\nD. Alley - Alleys are typically narrow and not designed for high-speed travel; they are usually found in urban areas and are meant for slower speeds and local access.\\n\\nE. Parking lot - Parking lots are intended for parking vehicles, not for high-speed travel. Speeds are generally low due to the close proximity of parked cars and pedestrians.\\n\\nBased on this analysis, the most consistent place where cars are designed to and typically do travel at very high speeds is on a race track.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: C.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where do cars usually travel at very high speeds?
