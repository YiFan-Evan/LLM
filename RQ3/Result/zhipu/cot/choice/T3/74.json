Back taxes refer to taxes that were not paid when they were due. The term \\\"current taxes\\\" refers to taxes that are due and payable in the current period or financial year. Therefore, it is logical to assume that if Joe owned back taxes, he could also have issues with his current taxes, which would be the taxes he needs to pay now.\\n\\nOptions A (anterior) and B (front) do not make sense in the context of taxes because they are not terms used to describe types of taxes. Option C (main) is also not appropriate because it is not a type of tax; rather, it might refer to the primary or most significant amount of tax, which is not the question being asked. Option D (front) is a repetition of option B and is similarly not relevant.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. current\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Joe owned back taxes as well as what other type of taxes?
