(Since the top reason-word is \"polling_places\", the model associates the concept of getting a drink with a public space where people gather. Additionally, the word \"take_away\" suggests that the cup is being taken from a common area rather than a personal one (such as a kitchen cabinet). The word \"desire\" also implies that the individual is seeking a refreshment and therefore more likely to use a water fountain.
