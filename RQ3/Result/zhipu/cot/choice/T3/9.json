The phrase \\\"sundown\\\" or \\\"sun set\\\" indeed refers to the sun descending, but it doesn't logically connect to the observer's position relative to a rising object. Instead, when you see something rise, you are indeed observing it from a position lower than the object, as it moves from a lower to a higher position in your field of view.\\n\\nThe option \\\"near\\\" does not necessarily describe the observer's position in relation to the rising action. The observer could be near or far from the object; the term \\\"near\\\" does not inherently describe the vertical relationship between the observer and the rising object.\\n\\nTherefore, the correct answer based on the vertical relationship is that you are below the object as it rises.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: D.\""}]
