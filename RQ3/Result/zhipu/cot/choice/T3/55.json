Tree - Weasels can climb, but their body shape is not specifically adapted for tree hunting.\\nB. Mulberry bush - This is not a typical hunting ground for weasels.\\nC. Chicken coop - While weasels might prey on chickens, their body shape is not specifically adapted for chicken coops.\\nD. Viking ship - This is anachronistic and not relevant to the natural behavior of weasels.\\nE.

(Since weasel_words and weasels are highly associated with the question stem and the word \"weasel\" in the potential choices, the model determines that the answer may involve the behavior or physical characteristics of weasels. The word \"easy_way\" also suggests that the weasel's body and legs may be adapted for a particular purpose.
