(Since the model identified the words \"simulated\" and \"pass_on_information\", it suggests that the child may feel that people's beliefs are fabricated or socially constructed rather than genuine or real. Additionally, since the model highlighted the phrase \"feel_like_million\", it suggests that the child may feel isolated or different from others who seem to believe in things that he or she does not understand.
