Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. Train station - While it's possible to ask for change or tickets here, the cheapest way to travel among the options provided is not typically by train.\\n\\nB. Beach - This is an unlikely place to ask for change or tickets for travel, as beaches are not typical travel hubs.\\n\\nC. Bus depot - This is a plausible answer. Bus travel is often the cheapest option, and bus depots are places where one would find people asking for tickets or change to board a bus.\\n\\nD. Bridge - This doesn't make much sense as a place where people would regularly ask for travel tickets or change.\\n\\nE. Stumblebum - This is not a place; it's a slang term for a clumsy or inefficient person, so it doesn't fit the context.\\n\\nGiven the context of the question, the most likely answer is C, the bus depot, as it is the cheapest way to travel among the options and a common place to see people asking for change or tickets.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: C\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: There was more than one bum asking for change or a ticket, it was the cheapest way to travel so it was no surprise sight at the what?
