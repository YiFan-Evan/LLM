Death is highly unlikely as an immediate side effect of eating a hamburger under normal circumstances.\\nC. Illness is also unlikely to be immediate; foodborne illness typically has an incubation period before symptoms appear.\\nD. Health problems, like an increase in cholesterol or blood pressure, are not immediate side effects and usually develop over time with consistent eating habits.\\nE. Gain weight is a long-term consequence of consuming more calories than are burned, and it does not happen immediately after eating a hamburger.\\n\\nGiven the context of the question, which seems to suggest that nausea is not the least likely immediate side effect, and considering that death, illness, and health problems are even less likely as immediate effects, the conclusion is that gaining weight is the least likely immediate side effect.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: E\""}]
