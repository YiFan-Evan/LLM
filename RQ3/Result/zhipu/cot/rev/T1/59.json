I'll describe the process using BFS, which is well-suited for unweighted graphs and will efficiently find the shortest path in such cases.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (3) and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n3. If this node has not been visited, mark it as visited.\\n4. Check all adjacent nodes of the current node. If an adjacent node has not been visited, add it to the queue and record the node that we came from to get there (this is important for reconstructing the path later).\\n5.
