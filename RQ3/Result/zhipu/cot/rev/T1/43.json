BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\\n3. Also, maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node. This will help us backtrack the path once we reach the destination.\\n4. Dequeue a node, mark it as visited, and for each of its adjacent nodes, if it's not visited, enqueue it and record its parent.\\n5. If we dequeue the destination node, we can stop and backtrack the path using the parent dictionary.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 5 in the queue.\\n- Node 5 is connected to nodes 0 and 3, but since node 0 is not the destination and we haven't visited it yet, we enqueue it and record that its parent is 5.\\n- Similarly, we enqueue node 3 with its parent as 5.\\n- Dequeue node 0, mark it as visited. It's connected to nodes 4 and 5, but since we've already visited 5, we only enqueue node 4 with its parent as 0.\\n- Dequeue node 3, mark it as visited. It's connected to node 5, but since we've already visited it, we don't enqueue it again.\\n- Dequeue node 4, mark it as visited. It's connected to nodes 0 and 1, but since we've already visited them, we don't enqueue them.\\n- Now, dequeue node 1, mark it as visited. Node 1 is connected to nodes 2, 4, 6, and 7. We enqueue nodes 2, 6, and 7 with their parent as 1.\\n- Dequeue node 2, mark it as visited. It's connected to node 1, but since we've already visited it, we don't enqueue it.\\n- Dequeue node 6, which is the destination. We can stop here.\\n\\nTo backtrack the path, we start from node 6 and go to its parent until we reach the start node:\\n\\n- The parent of 6 is 1.\\n- The parent of 1 is not relevant since we are only interested in the path from 5 to 6.\\n- Therefore, the shortest path from node 5 to node 6 is 5->1->6.\\n\\nSo the final answer is:\\n5->1->6\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 4], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 5]]} The end node: 6 The start node: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The graph and the start and end nodes are the same as in the previous question.
