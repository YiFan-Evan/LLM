BFS is a good choice because it explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It guarantees that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path to it.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path to that node (initially, just the node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the queue, and for each of its adjacent nodes, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it with the updated path.\\n3. If the target node is dequeued, the path to it is the shortest, and we can return that path.\\n4.
