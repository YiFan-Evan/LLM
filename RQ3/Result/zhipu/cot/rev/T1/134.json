However, since I can't execute code, I will describe the steps as if I were implementing the algorithm:\\n\\n1. Create a set of all nodes with initial distances set to infinity, except for the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a min-heap) and insert the start node with a distance of 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through the current node. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the shortest distance.\\n   c. Add the neighbor to the priority queue with the updated distance.\\n4. The shortest path to the destination node will be recorded once it is extracted from the priority queue.\\n\\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph and find the shortest path from node 2 to node 8:\\n\\n1. Start at node 2 with distance 0. All other nodes have a distance of infinity.\\n2. Node 2 has neighbors 4 and 14. The distances to these nodes through node 2 are 1 (since there is a direct edge). If these are the first distances we've found to nodes 4 and 14, we update their distances to 1.\\n3. We now have node 4 with a distance of 1, and node 14 with a distance of 1 in our priority queue. Let's choose node 4, which has the smallest distance.\\n4. Node 4 has a neighbor, node 7, with a direct edge. The distance to node 7 through node 4 is 1. If this is the first distance we've found to node 7 or if it's shorter than the previously recorded distance, we update the distance to node 7 to 1 + 1 = 2.\\n5. We continue this process. Node 7 has a direct edge to node 8. The distance to node 8 through node 7 is 1. If this is the shortest distance found so far to node 8, we update it.\\n6. Since we've reached node 8, we have found the shortest path.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 2 to node 8 is 2->4->7->8.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->4->7->8\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 8], [0, 13], [0, 1], [1, 14], [2, 4], [2, 14], [3, 6], [4, 7], [5, 6], [5, 10], [6, 12], [8, 10], [9, 14], [11, 14]]} The end node: 8 The start node: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Apologies for the confusion in the previous response.

BFS is suitable because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (2 in this case).\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and check its neighbors.\\n4.
