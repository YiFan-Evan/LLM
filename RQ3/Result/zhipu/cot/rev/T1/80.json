Initialize the distance to the start node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\\n2. Set the start node as the current node.\\n3. Update the distance of the neighboring nodes and keep track of the nodes visited.\\n4. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance, and set it as the new current node.\\n5. Repeat the process until the destination node is reached or all nodes are visited.\\n\\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\\n\\n- Initialize distances: {0: inf, 1: 0, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: inf, 5: inf, 6: inf, 7: inf, 8: inf, 9: inf, 10: inf, 11: inf, 12: inf}\\n- Start with node 1 (current node).\\n- Node 1 is connected to nodes 2 and 11.

Node 2 is connected to node 1 (which is already visited), so there is no update needed.\\n- The smallest unvisited node is 11 (distance 1), visit it. Node 11 is connected to node 1 (which is already visited) and node 10 (update distance to 2).\\n- Update distances: {0: inf, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: inf, 4: inf, 5: inf, 6: inf, 7: inf, 8: inf, 9: inf, 10: 2, 11: 1, 12: inf}\\n- The smallest unvisited node is 10 (distance 2), visit it. Node 10 is connected to node 11 (which is already visited), so there is no update needed.\\n- The smallest unvisited node is 2 (distance 1), visit it. We already visited node 2 and there is no need to update distances.\\n- The smallest unvisited node is 3 (distance inf), but it can be reached through node 9 with a distance of 3, so update distance to 3.\\n- Update distances: {0: inf, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 3, 4: inf, 5: inf, 6: inf, 7: inf, 8: inf, 9: 3, 10: 2, 11: 1, 12: inf}\\n- The smallest unvisited node is 9 (distance 3), visit it. Node 9 is connected to node 3 and node 10, both of which are already visited with shorter paths, so no updates are needed.\\n- The smallest unvisited node is 4 (distance inf), but it can be reached through node 5 with a distance of 1, so update distance to 1.\\n- Update distances: {0: inf, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 3, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: inf, 7: inf, 8: inf, 9: 3, 10: 2, 11: 1, 12: inf}\\n- The smallest unvisited node is 5 (distance 1), which is our destination.
