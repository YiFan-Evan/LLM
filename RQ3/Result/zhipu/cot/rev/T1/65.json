BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This property makes BFS suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is reached by the shortest path.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n\\n```\\nnodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\nedges: [[0, 5], [1, 2], [2, 7], [3, 5], [3, 4], [4, 7], [6, 7]]\\n```\\n\\nWe start at node 4 and want to reach node 6.\\n\\n1.
