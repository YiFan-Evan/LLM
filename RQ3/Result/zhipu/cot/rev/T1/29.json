However, since the graph provided does not include weights for the edges, we will assume that each edge has a weight of 1 for simplicity.\\n\\nHere is the process using Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node (1), which is set to 0.\\n2. Initialize a priority queue (or a simple min-heap) and insert the start node (with distance 0).\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through the current node. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\\n   c. Keep track of the path by storing the predecessor of each node.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 1, distance is 0.\\n- Node 1 has neighbors 6 and 7. Update their distances to 1 (since we assume each edge weight is 1) and record that 1 is their predecessor.\\n- The next node with the smallest distance is either 6 or 7 (both have a distance of 1). Let's pick 6.\\n- Node 6 has no direct path to node 3, so we look at node 7 next.\\n- Node 7 has a direct path to node 3 (edge [2, 3]), so the distance to node 3 through node 7 is 2, which is shorter than the current distance (infinity).\\n\\nAt this point, we've found the shortest path to node 3, which is through node 7 with a distance of 2.
