BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the thought process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue an element from the queue, and for each of its adjacent nodes, if the node has not been visited yet, enqueue it with the updated path.\\n3. If the current node is the target, we stop and return the path.\\n4. Repeat the process until the queue is empty or we reach the target node.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this process to the given graph, starting from node 13 and aiming to reach node 6.\\n\\nStarting from node 13, we will explore its neighbors, which are nodes connected by an edge to node 13. According to the edges array, node 12 is a neighbor of node 13. We'll enqueue node 12 with the path 13->12.\\n\\nNow, we dequeue node 12 and look at its neighbors. Node 7 is a neighbor of node 12. We enqueue node 7 with the path 13->12->7.\\n\\nContinuing with node 7, we find that nodes 9 and 10 are neighbors, but we are looking for node 6, so we continue exploring. Node 10 is a neighbor of node 7, so we enqueue it with the path 13->12->7->10.\\n\\nFrom node 10, we see that node 6 is a neighbor, which is our destination.
