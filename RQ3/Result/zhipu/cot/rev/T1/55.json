BFS is a good choice for this because it explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\\n\\nHere's the thought process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (2 in this case).\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, maintain a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent, which will help backtrack the shortest path once we reach the target node.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start by enqueueing the starting node (2).\\n- Dequeue a node, mark it as visited, and check if it's the target node. If it is, we've found the shortest path.\\n- If it's not the target, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\\n\\nStarting from node 2:\\n- Its neighbors are 3 and 7.\\n- Node 3 is the target, so we stop here and backtrack to find the path.\\n\\nTo backtrack from node 3:\\n- We look at the parent dictionary and see that node 3's parent is node 2.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->3\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [1, 5], [2, 3], [2, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Apologies for the confusion in the previous explanation.
