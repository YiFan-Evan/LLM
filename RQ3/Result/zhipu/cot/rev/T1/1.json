BFS is suitable for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored, and a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent. This will help me reconstruct the path once I reach the target node.\\n\\n2. Enqueue the starting node (2 in this case) and set its parent to `None` because it's the starting point.\\n\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node to explore. For each of its adjacent nodes, if the node has not been visited yet, set its parent to the current node and enqueue it.\\n\\n4. If I dequeue a node and it is the target node (6 in this case), I stop the search because I've found the shortest path.\\n\\n5.
