BFS is a good choice because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the destination node, we have found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\\n3. Also, maintain a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node. This will help in reconstructing the path once the destination is reached.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and for each of its neighbors that haven't been visited, mark them as visited, add them to the queue, and record their parent.\\n5.
