However, since I can't run an actual algorithm here, I will describe the process as if I were implementing it.\\n\\n1. Initialize a set of unvisited nodes with all nodes in the graph.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For our edges, we can consider the edge weight as 1 since it's not specified.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited, we stop the process, as the shortest path to the destination has been found.\\n7.
