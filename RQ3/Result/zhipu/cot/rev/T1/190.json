Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node).\\n2. Dequeue the first element from the queue and check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found our shortest path.\\n3.

This connection will be explored as follows:\\n- Dequeue [0->5->7], we've already visited node 7, but we need to check node 8 as well, which is connected to node 2.\\n- Dequeue [0->5->7->8], visit its neighbor (15, but we are looking for node 2, which is not a neighbor of 8).\\n- We need to backtrack to node 6, which is connected to node 8. Node 6 is connected to node 0, but we are looking for node 2.\\n- We have missed the connection from node 2 to node 8. Let's correct that and enqueue node 8 with the path [0->2->8].\\n\\nNow, when we dequeue [0->2->8], we see that node 8 is connected to node 2, which is our target.
