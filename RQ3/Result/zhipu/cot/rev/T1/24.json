However, since this is a simple graph and the number of nodes is small, we can also use a breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path, which is generally easier to implement for an unweighted graph like this one.\\n\\nHere is the step-by-step process for a BFS:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node to process.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of the node's neighbors that hasn't been visited, mark it as visited, record the node that we arrived from, and enqueue it.\\n4.
