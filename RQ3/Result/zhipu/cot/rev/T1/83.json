Enqueue node 12 and record the path to it (1->12).\\n- Dequeue node 12, visit its neighbors: 0 and 1 (which we've already visited). Enqueue node 0 and record the path to it (12->0), but we're not interested in revisiting nodes.\\n- Dequeue node 0, visit its neighbors: 8 and 12 (which we've already visited). Enqueue node 8 and record the path to it (0->8).\\n- Dequeue node 8, visit its neighbors: 11 (which we haven't visited yet) and 3.

However, we need to find the direct path from node 1 to node 10, so we need to look at the paths we recorded.\\n\\nWe see that node 4 is directly connected to node 10, and node 4 can be reached from node 1 through node 6 and then node 4.
