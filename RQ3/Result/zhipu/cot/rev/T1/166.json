BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is done so via the shortest path from the starting node.\\n\\nHere's the process step-by-step:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node (20 in this case).\\n2. Keep a record of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n4. If it is the target node (9 in this case), we stop and backtrack to find the path.\\n5. Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighboring nodes.\\n6. Repeat the process until the target node is reached or the queue is empty.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 20, which is connected to node 21.\\n- Move to node 21, which is connected to nodes 12 and 22.\\n- Move to node 12, which is connected to node 19.\\n- Move to node 19, which does not lead to node 9, so backtrack to node 21 and move to node 22.\\n- Move to node 22, which is connected to nodes 4 and 12 (which we've already visited), and node 4 is also connected to node 9.\\n\\nSo, the path from node 20 to node 9 via node 21, node 22, and node 4 is the shortest path.
