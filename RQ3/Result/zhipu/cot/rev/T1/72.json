BFS is a traversal for a tree or graph data structure. It starts at the tree root and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process for finding the shortest path from node 1 to node 5:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node (1).\\n2. Keep a set to track visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, keep a dictionary to store the parent of each node. This will help backtrack the path once the target is reached.\\n4. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node.\\n   b. If it is the target node (5), backtrack using the parent dictionary to find the shortest path.\\n   c. If it's not the target, mark it as visited.\\n   d. For each edge connected to this node, if the connected node has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent as the current node, and enqueue it.\\n5.

Enqueue 3, 6, and 7 (if they're not already visited).\\n- Dequeue the next node, which could be 3, 6, or 7. Say we dequeue 3 first, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (which are not given in the edges, so we skip this step).\\n- Continue this process with the next node, which could be 6 or 7. Let's say we dequeue 6, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (which is only node 5 in this case).\\n- Now, dequeue node 7 if it hasn't been visited yet, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors.\\n- When we dequeue node 5 (reached from node 6), since it's our target, we stop and backtrack to find the path.\\n\\nBacktracking from node 5, we see that its parent is node 6.
