BFS is a good fit for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.\\n\\nHere's how we can apply BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node (1 in this case), along with the path to that node (which is just [1] at this point).\\n2. Dequeue the first element from the queue. Check if it is the target node (5 in this case). If it is, we have found our shortest path.\\n3. If it's not the target node, iterate through its neighbors and for each neighbor that hasn't been visited yet, enqueue it along with the path that led to it.\\n4.
