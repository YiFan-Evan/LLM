BFS is suitable for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node and a dictionary to keep track of the paths taken to reach each node (we can call this `parent` dictionary).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node to visit.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, if it has not been visited yet (not in the `parent` dictionary), mark it as visited by setting its parent to the current node.\\n   c. If the neighbor is the destination node, we have found our shortest path.\\n   d. If it's not the destination, enqueue the neighbor for further exploration.\\n3. Once we find the destination, backtrack from the destination to the start using the `parent` dictionary to construct the path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 8.\\n- Node 8 has neighbors 4, 5, and 7.\\n- Visit node 4 first.
