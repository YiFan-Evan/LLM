BFS is suitable because it explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level, thereby ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found.\\n\\nHere's the process for the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. The queue will hold the nodes to be explored, and the visited set will keep track of which nodes have already been visited to prevent processing a node more than once.\\n2. Enqueue the start node (6) and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\\n4. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Also, keep track of the previous node that led to this neighbor so we can reconstruct the path later.\\n5.
