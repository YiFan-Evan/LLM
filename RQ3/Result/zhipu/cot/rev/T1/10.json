Let's re-evaluate the graph with the start node as 1 and the end node as 0 using the BFS algorithm, as it is the most suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nThe graph and the nodes/edges are as follows:\\n- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\n- Edges: 0-2, 0-1, 1-6, 1-7, 3-4, 3-5, 3-6\\n\\nHere's the BFS process:\\n\\n1.
