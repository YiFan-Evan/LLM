If a shorter path to a neighbor is found, the distance to that neighbor is updated, and the neighbor is added to the list of nodes to be checked.\\n\\nLet's apply Dijkstra's algorithm step by step for the given graph:\\n\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 4], [5, 7], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 5\\nDestination: 1\\n\\nStep 1: Initialize distances from the start node to all other nodes as infinite, except for the start node which is 0.

There are no neighbors of 6 that are not already visited or that do not have a shorter path, so we move on.\\n\\nStep 5: The unvisited node with the smallest distance is node 7 (which has already been visited). We need to look at the other unvisited nodes. The next smallest distance is from node 5 to node 1, which is not directly connected, so we need to look for a path that goes through an intermediate node. We see that there is no direct path from 5 to 1, but we can get to 1 from 5 by going through 7 and then to 1 through 4.

Initialize the distance to the start node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.\\n2. Set the start node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. Then, select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, and set it as the new \\\"current node.\\\" If there's a tie, choose any of them.\\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the destination node is reached.\\n\\nLet's apply this to our graph:\\n\\n- distances = {0: inf, 1: inf, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: inf, 5: 0, 6: inf, 7: inf}\\n- previous = {0: None, 1: None, 2: None, 3: None, 4: None, 5: None, 6: None, 7: None}\\n- unvisited = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7}\\n\\nNode 5 is the start node, and its distance is 0. Its neighbors are 7. We update the distance to 7:\\n- distances[7] = min(distances[7], distances[5] + 1) => distances[7] = 1\\n\\nNow, the unvisited nodes with their distances are:\\n- {0: inf, 1: inf, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: inf, 6: inf, 7: 1}\\n\\nWe choose node 7 as the next node with the smallest distance.

Its neighbors are 7, but since we've already visited 7, we don't need to update any distances.\\n\\nNow, we need to find the shortest path to node 1. Node 1 is not directly connected to 5 or 7, but it is connected to 4. We need to check if we can reach node 1 through node 4. Since node 4 is not directly connected to 5 or 7, we need to check if we can reach node 4 through node 3 or node 7. Node 4 is connected to node 1 and node 3, but since we don't have a direct path from 5 to 3 or 7 to 3, we cannot use node 3 to reach node 4. However, we can reach node 4 from node 7, and then from node 4 to node 1.\\n\\nLet's update the distances accordingly:\\n- distances[4] = min(distances[4], distances[7] + 1) => distances[4] = 2\\n\\nNow, the unvisited nodes with their distances are:\\n- {0: inf, 1: inf, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: 2, 6: 2, 7: 1}\\n\\nNext, we choose node 4. Its neighbors are 1 and 3. We update the distance to 1:\\n- distances[1] = min(distances[1], distances[4] + 1) => distances[1] = 3\\n\\nNow, node 1 has a distance of 3, and since it's our destination, we can stop here.\\n\\nTo reconstruct the path, we start from node 1 and follow the previous pointers:\\n- previous[1] = 4\\n- previous[4] = 7\\n- previous[7] = 5\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->7->4->1\""}]
