This algorithm works by finding the shortest path from the starting node to all other nodes, one by one, by building up a path tree. It keeps track of the minimum distance from the start node to each node and updates it if a shorter path is found.\\n\\nHere is the thought process for applying Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize the distances to all nodes to infinity, except for the start node (node 23), which is set to 0.\\n2. Set the start node as the current node and mark all other nodes as unvisited.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors.\\n4. Calculate the tentative distance to each neighbor by adding the distance from the start node to the current node plus the distance from the current node to the neighbor.\\n5. If the tentative distance to a neighbor is less than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and set the current node as the previous node for this neighbor.\\n6. Once all neighbors have been considered, mark the current node as visited.\\n7. Select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new \\\"current node\\\" and repeat steps 3-6.\\n8. Stop when the destination node (node 22) has been visited, and reconstruct the path by tracing back the previous nodes.\\n\\nNow let's apply this process to our graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 23 with a distance of 0.\\n- Node 23 has no direct edges to node 22, so we move to its neighbors.\\n- We find node 20, which is connected to node 23 with an edge, so the distance to node 20 is 1 (23 -> 20).\\n- Continue this process with node 20, finding the shortest path to its neighbors.\\n- Among the neighbors of node 20, we find node 9 connected with an edge, so the distance to node 9 is 2 (23 -> 20 -> 9).\\n- Continue with node 9, and we find node 20 connected back, which doesn't improve the distance, so we look for other neighbors.\\n- We find node 21 connected to node 9 with an edge, so the distance to node 21 is 3 (23 -> 20 -> 9 -> 21).\\n- Now, from node 21, we find node 22 connected with an edge, so the distance to node 22 is 4 (23 -> 20 -> 9 -> 21 -> 22).\\n\\nSince we've reached node 22, we can stop here. We have found the shortest path from node 23 to node 22.
