Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent, which will help us reconstruct the path later.\\n\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and examine it. For each of its neighbors that haven't been visited yet, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n\\n3.
