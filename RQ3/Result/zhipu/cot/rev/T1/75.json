However, since the actual edge weights are not provided, I will assume that each edge has a weight of 1, which is common when the graph is not weighted.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process using a simplified version of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except the start node which is set to 0.\\n2. Initialize a set of unvisited nodes, which initially contains all nodes.\\n3. While the set of unvisited nodes is not empty:\\n   a. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance (initially the start node).\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through the current node. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance.\\n   c. Mark the current node as visited by removing it from the set of unvisited nodes.\\n4. Once all nodes have been visited or the destination is reached, the shortest path can be reconstructed by backtracking from the destination node to the start node using a predecessor map.\\n\\nLet's apply this process to the given graph:\\n\\n1. Start at node 1 with distance 0.\\n2. Node 1 is connected to node 2, so we update the distance to node 2 to be 1 (since we're assuming a weight of 1 for each edge).\\n3. Node 2 is connected to node 4, but since node 4 is not directly connected to the start node, its distance remains infinity. However, node 2 is also connected to the destination node 3, so we update the distance to node 3 to be 2.\\n4. We mark node 1 as visited and move to the next unvisited node with the smallest distance, which is node 2.\\n5. Node 2 is already visited, so we move to the next unvisited node, which could be node 3 if it has been reached with a smaller distance.\\n6. Since we've reached node 3 with a distance of 2, which is the smallest distance possible, we can stop the algorithm.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 3 is through node 2.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path taken to reach it (initially just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the first element from the queue. This is the current node.\\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, if the neighbor has not been visited yet, enqueue it along with the path taken to reach it, appending the neighbor to the path.\\n4.

There are no other nodes directly connected to node 1, so we move on to node 2, which is already in the queue.\\n5. We have not yet found node 3, so we continue with node 2. Node 2 is connected to node 4, but node 4 does not lead directly to node 3, so we do not enqueue node 4.\\n6. We have explored all nodes that can be reached directly from node 1 and node 2. However, we missed that node 3 is connected to node 5, which is in turn connected to node 0, which is the starting point of several edges.

It is connected to node 2, so we enqueue node 2 with the path [1, 2].\\n3. Dequeue node 2. It is connected to node 4, but we are looking for node 3, so we continue.\\n4. We missed that node 3 is connected to node 5. Since we are using BFS, we should have considered all neighbors of node 3 when we first reached it. We enqueue node 5 with the path [1, 2, 4, 6, 5] (though we didn't actually take this path in our search).\\n5. Dequeue node 5. It is connected to node 3, which is our end node.
