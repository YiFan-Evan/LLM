Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node (2), which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a simple min-heap) to keep track of the nodes to explore. Initially, it will contain the start node with a distance of 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, remove the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\\n4. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through the current node. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\\n5. Keep track of the path by storing the predecessor of each node.\\n\\nLet's simulate this process:\\n\\n- Start with node 2, distance = 0.\\n- Explore neighbors of node 2: node 4 (distance through node 2 is 1).\\n- Node 4 has a distance of 1, which is the shortest path found so far.\\n- Explore neighbors of node 4: node 5 (distance through node 4 is 2).\\n- Node 5 has no direct path to node 8, so we continue.\\n- We need to go back to the priority queue and explore the next node with the smallest distance. At this point, it's node 3 (distance through node 0 or 1 is 1).\\n- Continue exploring from node 3, and we find node 7 and node 12 with distances of 2 and 3, respectively.\\n- Continue with the next smallest distance, which is node 7 (distance of 2).\\n- Explore from node 7, but there is no direct path to node 8.\\n- Go back to the priority queue and take the next smallest distance, which is node 12 (distance of 3).\\n- From node 12, we find node 13 with a distance of 4.\\n- Continue with node 5, which leads us to node 14 with a distance of 3.\\n- Now, we have reached node 14, which has a direct connection to node 8 (distance through node 14 is 1).\\n\\nThe shortest path to node 8 is through node 4, then node 5, then node 14, and finally node 8.
