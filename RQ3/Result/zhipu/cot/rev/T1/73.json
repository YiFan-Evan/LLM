BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere is the thought process for applying BFS to this graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (1) along with the path to reach it (which is just [1] at this point).\\n2. Dequeue the first element from the queue.

If it is not the target node, iterate over its neighbors and for each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it along with the updated path.\\n5.
