From the provided graph, we see that node 9 is connected to node 6.\\n\\nNow, from node 6, we look for edges that lead to other nodes. We see that node 6 is connected to node 5.\\n\\nContinuing this process, we look at the connections from node 5, which leads to node 2.\\n\\nFrom node 2, we have edges to nodes 5, 10, and 3.
