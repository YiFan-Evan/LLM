BFS is a good fit for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path to get there.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node.\\n4. If it is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n5. If it is not the target node, add all unvisited adjacent nodes to the queue and mark them as visited.\\n6. Keep track of the previous node for each node visited to reconstruct the path once the target is found.\\n\\nNow let's apply this to the given graph.\\n\\nStarting at node 8, we will explore its neighbors, which are node 3 (from the edges array). We mark node 8 as visited.\\n\\nMoving to node 3, we explore its neighbors, which are nodes 2 and 13 (from the edges array). Node 3 has already been visited, so we skip it and mark nodes 2 and 13 as visited if they haven't been already.\\n\\nFrom node 2, we go to node 3 (but it's already visited), and from node 13, we don't see any direct path to node 6, so we continue.\\n\\nWe continue this process until we reach node 6. To reconstruct the path, we'd need to keep track of the nodes that led us to each visited node. Since I don't have an actual data structure to keep track of the visited nodes and their predecessors, I'll describe the final steps without the actual tracking:\\n\\n- At some point, we will reach node 6 directly from node 5, and since node 5 is connected to node 4 which is connected to node 3, and node 3 is connected to node 8 (our start node), we have found our shortest path.\\n\\nReconstructing the path from the end (node 6) to the start (node 8), we would go from node 6 to node 5, then to node 4, then to node 3, and finally to node 8.
