However, since I can't run actual code, I'll describe the steps conceptually.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a set of unvisited nodes with the starting node (3) and set its distance to 0. All other nodes will have an initial distance of infinity (or a very large number).\\n2. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node. For the starting node (3), the path is just [3].\\n3. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance. Initially, this will be the starting node (3).\\n4. For the current node, look at all of its adjacent nodes (nodes connected by an edge).\\n5. For each adjacent node, calculate the distance from the starting node through the current node to the adjacent node.\\n6. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance for the adjacent node, update the distance and the shortest path to this node.\\n7. Mark the current node as visited and remove it from the set of unvisited nodes.\\n8. Repeat steps 3 to 7 until the target node (9) is visited.\\n\\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\\n\\nStarting node: 3\\n\\n- The unvisited nodes are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 with initial distances: \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, 0, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e\\n- The shortest path to node 3 is [3]\\n\\nNode 3 is connected to nodes 6 and 9.\\n\\n- The distance to node 6 through node 3 is 1 (since there's a direct edge [3, 6]), which is shorter than the current distance to node 6 (which is \u221e), so we update the distance and the shortest path to node 6: [3, 6]\\n- The distance to node 9 through node 3 is also 1 (since there's a direct edge [3, 9]), which is shorter than the current distance to node 9 (which is \u221e), so we update the distance and the shortest path to node 9: [3, 9]\\n\\nNode 3 is now visited.\\n\\n- The unvisited nodes with the smallest distance are: 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\n- The shortest path to node 9 is [3, 9]\\n\\nSince we have already found the shortest path to node 9, we don't need to continue the algorithm.
