Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node (6) along with the path to that node (which is just [6] at this point).\\n2. Dequeue the first element from the queue and examine its neighbors.\\n3. For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited yet, enqueue it with the current path extended by that neighbor.\\n4.
