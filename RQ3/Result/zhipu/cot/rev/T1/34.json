I'll describe a BFS approach here.\\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works by exploring the graph level by level, starting from the source node. It keeps track of the shortest path to each node it visits. When it reaches the target node, we have our shortest path.\\n\\nHere's how we can apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node (5) along with its path (just [5] initially).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n3. Check if this node is the target node (4). If it is, we have found our shortest path.\\n4. If it's not the target, for each of its adjacent nodes, enqueue them with the current path plus the adjacent node.\\n5.
