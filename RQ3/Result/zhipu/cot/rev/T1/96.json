However, since I cannot execute code, I will describe the steps to find the shortest path manually.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a set of unvisited nodes with all nodes in the graph.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node (5) and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For our edges, this would mean looking at nodes 12 (since there is an edge between 5 and 12).\\n5. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited, we have completed our search and can stop.\\n7. If the destination node has not been marked visited, select the unvisited node that has the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's walk through the steps for our specific graph and nodes:\\n\\n- Start at node 5 with a distance of 0.\\n- The only neighbor of node 5 is node 12. Since there is an edge between 5 and 12, we set the tentative distance to 1 for node 12.\\n- Node 5 is now visited.\\n- The smallest tentative distance among the unvisited nodes is for node 12, so it becomes the current node.\\n- Node 12 has edges to node 6. We update the tentative distance to node 6 through node 12, which is now 2 (assuming there was no previous shorter path to node 6).\\n- Node 12 is now visited.\\n- The smallest tentative distance among the unvisited nodes is for node 6, so it becomes the current node.\\n- Node 6 has edges to nodes 12 (which we've already visited) and 4. We update the tentative distance to node 4 through node 6, which is now 3.\\n- Node 6 is now visited.\\n- The smallest tentative distance among the unvisited nodes is for node 4, which is our destination. Since we've reached our destination, we stop here.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 5 to node 4 is through node 12 and then node 6.

Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct start node (5) and end node (4) using the graph provided.\\n\\nThe graph is as follows, with nodes represented by numbers and edges represented as pairs of connected nodes:\\n\\n```\\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\\nEdges: [[0, 10], [0, 2], [1, 6], [2, 4], [3, 8], [3, 7], [4, 7], [4, 6], [5, 12], [6, 12], [8, 9], [11, 12]]\\n```\\n\\nTo find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) since all edges likely have equal weight (which is typical in an undirected graph without specified edge weights). BFS is a good choice because it explores the neighbors level by level, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nHere's how we can find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Start at node 5 and enqueue it.\\n2. Mark node 5 as visited.\\n3. Dequeue a node (starting with 5), and check all its neighbors.\\n4. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited, record the node from which it was reached (this helps reconstruct the path later), and enqueue it.\\n5. Repeat until the end node (4) is dequeued, or the queue is empty (which would mean there is no path).\\n\\nLet's apply these steps:\\n\\n- Start at node 5.\\n- Visit node 12 (since there is an edge between 5 and 12).\\n- Visit node 6 (since there is an edge between 6 and 12).\\n- From node 6, we can visit node 4 (since there is an edge between 4 and 6).\\n\\nWe've reached the end node (4) from node 6. Now we need to reconstruct the path from node 4 back to the start node (5). We know that:\\n\\n- Node 4 was reached from node 6.\\n- Node 6 was reached from node 12.\\n- Node 12 was reached from node 5.\\n\\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 is:\\n\\n5 -> 12 -> 6 -> 4\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n5->12->6->4\""}]
