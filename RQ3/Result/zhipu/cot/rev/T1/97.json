BFS is a good choice because it explores the neighbors of a node in layers, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has done so using the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the target node, we've found our shortest path.\\n    c. Otherwise, for each of its unvisited neighbors, add them to the queue and mark them as visited, keeping track of the node that led to them (this will help us reconstruct the path).\\n4. Once we reach the target node, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the recorded information to construct the path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph:\\n\\n- Start node: 2\\n- Destination: 9\\n\\nWe initialize our queue with the start node (2), and our visited set would be empty at the beginning.\\n\\nThe BFS process would go as follows:\\n\\n1. Dequeue node 2, mark it as visited.\\n   - Node 2 has an edge to node 12, enqueue 12 and record that 2 led to 12.\\n\\n2. Dequeue node 9 (since it's the first node in the queue), mark it as visited.\\n   - Node 9 has no edges leading to unvisited nodes.\\n\\nAt this point, we see that we've reached the target node (9) directly from the start node (2) in one step. Since this is an unweighted graph and BFS guarantees the shortest path in such cases, we can directly output the path as:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->9\\n\\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in my explanation because according to the graph provided, there is no direct edge from node 2 to node 9. I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct the BFS process:\\n\\n1. Dequeue node 2, mark it as visited.\\n   - Node 2 has an edge to node 12, enqueue 12 and record that 2 led to 12.\\n\\n2. Dequeue node 12, mark it as visited.\\n   - Node 12 is connected to nodes 0 and 3. Node 0 is already visited, so we only consider node 3. Enqueue 3 and record that 12 led to 3.\\n\\n3. Dequeue node 3, mark it as visited.\\n   - Node 3 is connected to nodes 4 and 12. Node 12 is already visited, so we only consider node 4. Enqueue 4 and record that 3 led to 4.\\n\\n4. Dequeue node 4, mark it as visited.\\n   - Node 4 is connected to nodes 10, 6, and 3. Nodes 3 and 10 are already visited, so we only consider node 6. Enqueue 6 and record that 4 led to 6.\\n\\n5. Dequeue node 6, mark it as visited.\\n   - Node 6 is connected to nodes 8 and 1. Node 1 is not visited, so we enqueue 1 and record that 6 led to 1.\\n\\n6. Dequeue node 1, mark it as visited.\\n   - Node 1 is connected to nodes 11 and 6. Node 6 is already visited, so we only consider node 11. Enqueue 11 and record that 1 led to 11.\\n\\n7. Dequeue node 11, mark it as visited.\\n   - Node 11 is connected to node 1, which is already visited.\\n\\nAt this point, we need to check if we have reached the destination node (9). However, during this process, we did not enqueue node 9, which means we have not found a path to node 9 from node 2 in the graph provided. It's possible there's an error in the graph description or the edges provided do not connect node 2 to node 9.\\n\\nIf we were to continue with the BFS and explore all possible paths, we would not find a path from node 2 to node 9 based on the edges given.

We revisit node 6, which is already marked as visited, but we missed exploring node 10 the first time around.\\n    - Node 6 has an edge to node 10.
