BFS is suitable for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process for applying BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\\n3. Keep track of the previous node for each visited node so that we can reconstruct the path once we reach the target.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and explore its neighbors.\\n5. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its previous node, and add it to the queue.\\n6. If we reach the target node, we stop and reconstruct the path by following the previous nodes from the target back to the start.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph, starting from node 5 and aiming to reach node 17:\\n\\n- We start with node 5 in our queue.\\n- We explore the neighbors of node 5, which are nodes 7 and 3 (from the edges list).\\n- Node 7 is not visited, so we mark it as visited and record that its previous node is 5, then add it to the queue.\\n- Node 3 is not visited, so we mark it as visited and record that its previous node is 5, then add it to the queue.\\n- Next, we take node 7 from the queue and explore its neighbors. We find node 1 and node 5, but node 5 is already visited, so we only consider node 1. Node 1 is not visited, so we mark it as visited and record that its previous node is 7, then add it to the queue.\\n- We continue this process until we reach node 17 or exhaust the queue.\\n\\nTo save time and space, I'll simulate the BFS process in my mind and provide you with the shortest path:\\n\\nStarting from node 5, we go to node 7, then to node 1, and from node 1, we can reach node 10, then node 17.

Initialize a queue and add the start node (5) to it.\\n2. Keep a record of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\\n3. Maintain a dictionary or a list to keep track of each node's parent, which will help in reconstructing the path later.\\n\\nNow, let's simulate the BFS:\\n\\n- Start with node 5 in the queue.\\n- Node 5 has neighbors 7 and 3. Both are unvisited, so we visit node 7 first, marking it as visited and recording that its parent is 5. We add node 7 to the queue.\\n- Next, we visit node 3, mark it as visited, record that its parent is 5, and add it to the queue.\\n- We take node 7 from the queue and find its unvisited neighbors. Node 1 is unvisited, so we visit it, mark it as visited, record that its parent is 7, and add it to the queue. Node 5 is already visited, so we skip it.\\n- We take node 1 from the queue and find its unvisited neighbors. Node 9 and node 10 are unvisited, so we visit node 9, mark it as visited, record that its parent is 1, and add it to the queue.
