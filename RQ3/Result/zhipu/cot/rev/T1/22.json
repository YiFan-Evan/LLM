Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path to that node (initially just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the first element of the queue. This is the current node we're exploring.\\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it along with the path to that node.\\n4.
