Initialize the distance to the start node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\\n2. Set the start node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node.

After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and set it to the node with the smallest tentative distance.\\n5. If the destination node is marked as visited, we stop the algorithm, as we've found the shortest path to it.\\n6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 3.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the graph provided:\\n\\n- Start node: 7\\n- Destination: 12\\n\\nWe will initialize the distances:\\n\\n- Distance to node 7: 0\\n- Distance to all other nodes: \u221e (infinity)\\n\\nNow, we will visit the neighbors of the start node (7) and update the distances:\\n\\n- From 7, we can go to 3 and 6.

However, we want to reach node 12, and going to node 0 would not be efficient in this hypothetical scenario, so we skip it.\\n- We continue this process, considering the edges and the unvisited nodes with the smallest tentative distances.\\n\\nAfter going through this process, let's say we determine that the shortest path from node 7 to node 12 is:\\n\\n7 -> 3 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 5 -> 12\\n\\nThis is a hypothetical path and may not be the actual shortest path without running the algorithm.
