Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored, and a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node. Also, mark the starting node as visited.\\n\\n2. Add the starting node (6) to the queue.\\n\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node to explore.\\n   b. For each of its neighbors that has not been visited:\\n      i. Mark the neighbor as visited.\\n      ii. Record the node that was visited before this neighbor (to reconstruct the path later).\\n      iii. Enqueue the neighbor.\\n\\n4.
