It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to explore and maintains a set of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\\n\\nHere's the process step by step for the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (10) and a dictionary to keep track of the visited nodes and their parents (which node they were discovered from).\\n2.
