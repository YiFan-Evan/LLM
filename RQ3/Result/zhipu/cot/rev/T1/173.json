BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found our shortest path.\\n4. If the current node is not the target, add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue.\\n5.

Now, let's assume we have executed the BFS and found the shortest path.
