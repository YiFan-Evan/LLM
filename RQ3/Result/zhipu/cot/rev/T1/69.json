Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has a weight of 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's apply this to our graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 5 with a distance of 0.\\n- Node 5 is connected to node 7 with an edge. The tentative distance to node 7 is 0 + weight of edge (which is implicit and assumed to be 1) = 1.\\n- Node 7 is also connected to node 4 and node 5. Since we came from node 5 to node 7, we don't consider going back to node 5. The distance to node 4 through node 7 is 1 + 1 = 2.\\n- Now, the smallest distance in the unvisited set is node 7 with a distance of 1, so we move to node 7.\\n- From node 7, we can see node 4 with a distance of 2, but we also see node 6 with a distance of 1 + 1 = 2. Since node 6 is our target and we found a path to it, we can stop here.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 5 to node 6 is 5 -> 7 -> 6.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->7->6\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 4], [4, 7], [5, 7]]} The end node: 6 The start node: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Apologies for the confusion in the previous response.
