Initialize a set of unvisited nodes with all nodes in the graph and a set of visited nodes that is initially empty. Also, initialize a dictionary to store the shortest distance from the start node to each node, with all distances set to infinity except for the start node which is set to 0.\\n\\n2. While there are unvisited nodes, do the following:\\n   a. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance (initially, this will be the start node).\\n   b. Add this node to the set of visited nodes.\\n   c. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance from the start node through this node to the neighbor.\\n   d. If this distance is shorter than the currently known distance to the neighbor, update the shortest distance and the path to reach this neighbor.\\n\\n3. Repeat this process until all nodes have been visited or until the target node has been reached.\\n\\nLet's apply this process to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 4. The distances to all other nodes are set to infinity except for node 4, which is 0.\\n- Node 4 has edges to nodes 0 and 2. Let's consider the distance to node 0, which is 1 (the edge itself), and to node 2, which is also 1. Update the distances to these nodes if the new distance is shorter.\\n- Node 0 is now visited and has edges to nodes 3 and 4. The distance to node 3 is 2, and since it's shorter than the current known distance (infinity), update it. Node 4 is already visited.\\n- Node 2 is visited next and has edges to nodes 4 and 5. The distance to node 4 is 2, but it's already visited, and the distance to node 5 is 2, which is shorter than the current known distance (infinity), so update it.\\n- Node 5 is visited and has an edge to node 6, with a distance of 1, which is shorter than the current known distance (infinity) to node 6, so update it.\\n- Now, we can reach node 6 directly from node 5 with a distance of 1. Since there are no other nodes to visit, and we've reached our target, we can stop here.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 4 to node 6 is through node 5.

We move to node 2, which has a distance of 1 from node 4. Node 2 is connected to nodes 4 and 5. Node 4 is already visited, so we look at node 5. The distance from node 2 to node 5 is 1, so the total distance from node 4 to node 5 is 2, which is the shortest path to node 5 from node 4 that we have found so far.\\n4. Next, we visit node 5, which is at a distance of 2 from node 4. Node 5 is connected to node 6, and since there are no other nodes to consider for reaching node 6, we take this edge.\\n5.
