BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.\\n\\nHere's the process step by step:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\\n3. Also, maintain a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent, which will help us reconstruct the path once we reach the destination.\\n\\nNow let's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 9.\\n- Visit the neighbors of 9, which are nodes 2 and 4.\\n- From node 2, we can visit node 4 (which we've already visited) and node 9 (the start, so we ignore it), and from node 4, we have no unvisited neighbors.\\n- At this point, we backtrack to node 2 and continue to its unvisited neighbor, node 9, which we ignore because it's the start node.\\n- We continue this process, visiting nodes 6 and 14 from node 9, but we don't find the destination node 1.\\n- We backtrack and explore other paths. From node 6, we visit node 10, and from node 10, we don't find the destination, so we backtrack again.\\n- From node 6, we also visit node 9 (which we ignore), and we've already visited all other neighbors of node 6.\\n- We backtrack further and continue exploring other paths from the nodes we've visited.\\n\\nContinuing this process, we would eventually visit node 1 from node 12, since there is an edge between them. To reconstruct the path, we would look at the parent of node 1, then the parent of that node, and so on, until we reach the start node. However, since I can't execute code, I'll describe the general steps you would take to find the path:\\n\\n- Find the parent of node 1 in the parent dictionary, which would be node 12.\\n- Find the parent of node 12, which is not in the edges list, so we look at the parent dictionary and find that it's node 1, which is the start node.\\n- Since we reached the start node, we stop, and the path is reconstructed by following the parents from the destination to the start.\\n\\nIn the case of the given graph, the shortest path from node 9 to node 1 is through node 2 to node 4 to node 12 to node 1.
