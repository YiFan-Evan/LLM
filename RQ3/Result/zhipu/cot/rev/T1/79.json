Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes having an infinite distance except for the starting node, which has a distance of 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a set) to hold all the unvisited nodes, with the starting node having the highest priority (distance).\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Remove the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through this node to see if it's shorter than the previously recorded distance.\\n   c. If it is, update the shortest distance and set this node as the previous node for the neighbor.\\n4. Once we've visited all nodes or the destination node is dequeued from the priority queue, the shortest path to the destination can be reconstructed by backtracking from the destination node to the start node using the previous node information.\\n\\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize distances: {0: inf, 1: inf, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: inf, 5: inf, 6: 0, 7: inf}\\n2. Priority queue initialized with nodes: {6}\\n3. Node 6 has the smallest distance (0), so we look at its neighbors (none are directly connected to 4).\\n4. Move to the next smallest distance node, which is not connected to the destination, and continue this process.\\n5. We find that node 4 is not reachable from node 6 directly or through its neighbors (since there are no edges connecting 6 to 4 or its neighbors to 4).\\n\\nSince there are no edges that connect node 6 to node 4 or any intermediate nodes that could lead to node 4, it is not possible to reach the destination node from the start node in this graph.
