Initialize a queue and add the start node to it, also keeping track of the level (distance from the start node) and the previous node for each node.\\n2.

For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, mark it as visited, set its level to the current node's level + 1, set its previous node to the current node, and enqueue it.\\n4.
