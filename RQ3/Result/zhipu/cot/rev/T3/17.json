Initialize the graph, the start node, and the target node.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For our edges, the weight is assumed to be 1 if it is not specified.\\n5. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and set it to the node with the smallest tentative distance.\\n6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the destination node is marked as visited or all nodes have been visited.\\n\\nNow let's apply these steps to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 3, set its distance to 0 (all other nodes have a distance of infinity).\\n- Node 3 has edges to nodes 5 and 6. The distance to node 5 is 1, and the distance to node 6 is also 1. We update the distances to these nodes to 1 if they are greater than the new calculated distances.\\n- Node 5 has edges to nodes 2 and 6. The distance to node 2 is 2 (since 3 -> 5 -> 2), and the distance to node 6 is 2 (since 3 -> 5 -> 6). Update if necessary.\\n- Node 6 has edges to nodes 0 and 7. The distance to node 0 is 2 (since 3 -> 6 -> 0), and the distance to node 7 is 1 (since 3 -> 6 -> 7). Update if necessary.\\n- Node 7 has an edge to node 1. The distance to node 1 is 2 (since 3 -> 6 -> 7 -> 1).\\n- At this point, we can see that the shortest path to node 1 from node 3 is through nodes 6 and then 7.

Node 5 has edges to nodes 2 and 6. Since we're looking for the shortest path to node 7, we're only interested in node 6 for now, which would give us a path of 3->5->6 with a total distance of 2.

The distance to node 7 is 1 (since 6 -> 7), which is less than the current assigned distance of infinity. Update the distance to node 7 to 1 plus the distance from node 3 to node 6, which is 2.\\n8. Now, node 7 has a tentative distance of 2, which is the shortest distance found so far, and it's the target node.
