Since the graph does not specify weights for the edges, we will assume that each edge has a weight of 1, which makes Dijkstra's algorithm applicable.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process to apply Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a min-heap) and insert the start node with a distance of 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, extract the node with the smallest distance.\\n4. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the distance from the start node through the current node. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\\n5. Repeat this process until the target node is dequeued from the priority queue. The path to this node is the shortest path from the start node.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize distances: {0: inf, 1: inf, 2: inf, 3: 0, 4: inf, 5: inf, 6: inf, 7: inf, 8: inf, 9: inf, 10: inf, 11: inf, 12: inf, 13: inf, 14: inf}\\n2. Start with the start node (3) and its distance (0) in the priority queue.\\n3. Node 3 has edges to node 6. The distance to node 6 through node 3 is 1, which is shorter than the current distance (inf), so update the distance to 1 and add node 6 to the priority queue.\\n4. Continue with the next node with the smallest distance. Node 6 has edges to nodes 12 and 14. Update the distances for these nodes if they are shorter than the current distances.\\n5. Repeat the process until we reach node 13. We will keep track of the previous node that led us to each node, which will allow us to reconstruct the path at the end.\\n\\nAfter applying Dijkstra's algorithm, we find that the shortest path from node 3 to node 13 is through nodes 6, 12, and then 13.
