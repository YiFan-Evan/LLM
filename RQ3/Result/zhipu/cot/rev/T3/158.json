Initialize a queue with the start node and a dictionary to keep track of the paths to each node.\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of the dequeued node, if it has not been visited, enqueue it and record the path to it by appending the current node to the path.\\n4. Repeat the process until the destination node is dequeued.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 9 in the queue.\\n- Node 9 has neighbors 10.\\n- Go to node 10, which has neighbors 8 and 10 (it's connected to itself, which we can ignore).\\n- Go to node 8, which has no unvisited neighbors.\\n- Go back to node 9 and try the next unvisited neighbor, which doesn't exist.\\n\\nAt this point, we need to backtrack. However, we've only explored node 9 and its direct neighbors.
