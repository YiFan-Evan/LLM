I will assume that you want to find the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes in the graph. However, if you have a specific destination node in mind, please provide it, and I will calculate the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nAssuming we are finding the shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes, we can use the same BFS approach as described earlier. Since we already know that the shortest path from node 0 to node 3 is 0->3, let's continue to find the paths to the other nodes.\\n\\nFrom node 0, we have edges to nodes 3 and 7. We've already covered node 3. Let's continue with node 7:\\n- From node 7, we have no direct path to the target, but we can reach node 0 (which is the start node, so no need to go there again).\\n\\nNow let's look at the other nodes:\\n- From node 1, we can reach node 2 and node 4.\\n- From node 2, there are no further edges.\\n- From node 4, we can reach nodes 5 and 7.\\n\\nLet's summarize the shortest paths from node 0 to all other nodes:\\n- 0 to 1: 0->1\\n- 0 to 2: 0->1->2\\n- 0 to 3: 0->3\\n- 0 to 4: 0->1->4\\n- 0 to 5: 0->1->4->5\\n- 0 to 6: 0->3->6 (since there's an edge from 3 to 6)\\n- 0 to 7: 0->7\\n\\nSince you did not specify a destination, I will provide the shortest paths to all nodes as an example.
