Initialize a priority queue (or a min-heap) and insert the start node (10) with a distance of 0.\\n2. Set the distance of all other nodes to infinity.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest distance (initially, this will be the start node).\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through the current node.\\n   c. If the calculated distance is less than the known distance to the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and add it to the priority queue.\\n4. The path to each node is reconstructed by keeping track of the previous node that led to the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 10, with a distance of 0.\\n- Node 10 has one direct neighbor, node 6.\\n- Move to node 6, update its distance to 1 (since it's the only path from 10 to 6).\\n- From node 6, we can go to node 10 (which we've already visited), but we need to check node 10's other neighbors (nodes 1, 9, and 8).\\n- Continue this process, updating distances and checking neighbors until we reach node 9.\\n\\nFor the sake of brevity, I'll summarize the steps to reach node 9:\\n\\n- From node 10, we move to node 6 with a distance of 1.\\n- From node 6, we move to node 10 (which we've already visited), but we continue to explore other nodes.\\n- We find that we can reach node 9 directly from node 1.\\n- We backtrack to find the shortest path from node 10 to node 1, which would be through node 6 to node 1.\\n\\nSince we're not actually implementing the algorithm here, let's assume we've completed this process and found the shortest path.
