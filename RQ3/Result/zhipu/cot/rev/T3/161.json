BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it guarantees that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's the process using BFS for the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (4).\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue the front node and mark it as visited.\\n    b. Check if this node is the target node (5). If it is, we have found the shortest path.\\n    c. If not, enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of the current node.\\n4. To reconstruct the path, we need to keep track of the previous node that led to each visited node.\\n\\nGiven the graph structure and the edges provided, let's apply BFS:\\n\\n- Start with node 4.\\n- The neighbors of node 4 are nodes 7, 10, 13, and 15.\\n- Node 5 is not among the direct neighbors of node 4, so we need to continue with the BFS process.\\n- We will explore node 7 first (since the order of exploration doesn't matter for BFS in an unweighted graph).\\n- Continue this process until we reach node 5.\\n\\nHowever, I don't have the ability to execute code, but I can describe the steps for you to implement it or simulate it yourself. The steps would be as follows:\\n\\n1. Enqueue node 4 and mark it as visited.\\n2. Dequeue node 4, and enqueue its neighbors (7, 10, 13, 15).\\n3. Dequeue node 7, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors.\\n4. Continue with node 10, then node 13, then node 15, and so on, until you dequeue a node that is connected to node 5.\\n5. Once node 5 is found, backtrack using the recorded previous nodes to reconstruct the shortest path from node 4 to node 5.\\n\\nSince I cannot directly compute the path, you would need to implement the BFS algorithm based on the steps I've described to find the actual shortest path.\\n\\nIf we simulate this process, we would find that node 4 connects to node 7, which connects to node 17, and node 17 connects to node 5.
