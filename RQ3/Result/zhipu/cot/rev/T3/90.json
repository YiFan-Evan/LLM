Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For our initial node, this step is trivial since it's the starting point.\\n5. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when we reach it), we can stop and return the shortest path.\\n7. If the destination node is not visited, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nNow let's apply this to our specific graph and start node:\\n\\n- Starting at node 1, we set its distance to 0 (since it's the starting point) and all other nodes' distances to infinity.\\n- Node 1 has edges to nodes 7 and 12. We'll update their distances to 1 (since they are directly connected to the start node).\\n- Among the nodes with a finite distance (1, 7, and 12), we choose node 1, which is the starting node, and mark it as visited.\\n- Next, we consider node 7, which is connected to node 3. We update the distance to node 3 if it's smaller than the current assigned distance.\\n- We continue this process, considering the neighbors of the current node, updating their distances if we find a shorter path, and marking nodes as visited once we've considered all their neighbors.\\n\\nIn our case, the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 can be found by following these steps:\\n\\n- From node 1, we have two options: node 7 and node 12. Let's choose node 7 since we need to go through node 3 to reach node 5.\\n- From node 7, we go to node 3.\\n- From node 3, we go to node 2.\\n- From node 2, we go to node 4.\\n- From node 4, we go to node 5.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->7->3->2->4->5\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 11], [1, 7], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 7], [6, 9], [8, 10], [10, 11], [10, 12]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node (1) to the destination (4), we can use Dijkstra's algorithm as described previously.
