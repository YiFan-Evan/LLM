Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a min-heap) and insert the start node with a distance of 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through the current node.\\n   c. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\\n4.

Node 2 is already visited, so we consider the edge to node 0.\\n- From node 0, we can go to nodes 4 and 7.
