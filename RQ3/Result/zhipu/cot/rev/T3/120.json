BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic ensures that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process for applying BFS to this graph:\\n\\n1.
