Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.\\n3.

While the queue is not empty, remove the first node from the queue and examine its neighbors.\\n5. For each unvisited neighbor, add it to the queue, mark it as visited, and record its parent.\\n6.
