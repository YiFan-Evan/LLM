Node `7` is not the destination, so we enqueue `7`.\\n- Next, we visit node `0` (from the start edges of node `4`), but we do not enqueue it because we are looking for the shortest path and we already visited node `0` from another path with fewer steps.\\n- Now, we visit node `5` (from the start edges of node `4`), which has an edge to node `2`, our destination.
