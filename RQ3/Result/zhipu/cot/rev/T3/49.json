BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have taken the shortest path to get there.\\n\\nHere's the thought process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node and a dictionary to track the path (or parent nodes).\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node and check if it is the destination.\\n3. If it is the destination, we stop and backtrack through the path dictionary to construct the shortest path.\\n4. If it's not the destination, for each of its adjacent nodes, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n5. Once we find the destination, backtrack from the destination to the start node using the recorded parents to construct the path.\\n\\nLet's apply this process to the given graph with the start node 5 and the destination node 1:\\n\\n- Start by enqueueing node 5.\\n- Node 5 has two edges: to nodes 7 and 1. Node 1 is our destination, so we've found the shortest path immediately.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 5 to node 1 is just 5->1 since we've reached the destination directly from the start node.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 4], [5, 7], [6, 7]]} The start node: 5 The destination: 1 since we've reached the destination directly from the start node.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Apologies for the oversight.
