Initialize distances: Set the distance to the start node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.\\n2. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited.\\n5. Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 3.\\n6. The algorithm finishes when the destination node has been marked visited, or when the smallest tentative distance among the nodes left unvisited is infinity, which indicates that the destination is not reachable from the start node.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n1.

Start at node 5, which has edges to node 11.\\n   - The distance to node 11 through node 5 is 1 (since there's a direct edge between them), so we update the distance to node 11 to 1.\\n   - distances = [\u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, 0, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, 1, \u221e, \u221e]\\n\\n3. Node 11 has the smallest tentative distance, so it becomes the current node. It has an edge to node 7.\\n   - The distance to node 7 through node 11 is 1, which is smaller than the current distance to node 7 (which is still infinity), so we update the distance to node 7 to 1 + 1 = 2.\\n   - distances = [\u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, 0, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, \u221e, 1, 2, \u221e]\\n\\n4.
