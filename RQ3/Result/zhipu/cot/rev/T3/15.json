However, since the graph is small and the format of the answer is not too complex, we can also solve this problem with a simple breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.\\n\\nLet's go through the steps of a BFS to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 5:\\n\\n1. Start from the starting node (node 2), and enqueue it into a queue.\\n2. Keep track of the paths taken to reach each node using a dictionary or a map.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node to visit.\\n4. For each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited yet, record the path to reach it and enqueue it.\\n5. If we reach the target node (node 5), we can stop the search.\\n\\nLet's simulate this process with the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 2.\\n- Enqueue node 2.\\n- Node 2 has neighbors 0, 4, and 6. Enqueue all unvisited neighbors and record the path to them.\\n  - Path to node 0: 2->0\\n  - Path to node 4: 2->4\\n  - Path to node 6: 2->6\\n- Dequeue node 2 and mark it as visited.\\n- Dequeue node 0. It has no unvisited neighbors that lead to node 5.\\n- Dequeue node 4. It has one unvisited neighbor, which is node 7. Record the path: 2->4->7.\\n- Dequeue node 6. It has no unvisited neighbors that lead to node 5.\\n- Dequeue node 7. It has no unvisited neighbors that lead to node 5.\\n- We notice that we haven't reached node 5 yet, so we need to continue. However, we see that node 4 has already been visited, and it does not have a direct path to node 5. We must have missed something in our process. Node 4 should have been expanded further. Node 4 is connected to node 7, but we should also check if node 7 is connected to node 5.\\n\\nLooking at the edges again, we see that node 3 is connected to both node 5 and node 6. We didn't consider node 3 as a path to node 5, but we should. Let's correct the process:\\n\\n- After visiting node 2, we should have considered node 3 as a potential path because node 2 is connected to node 3 through an edge.\\n- So, we enqueue node 3 and record the path to it: 2->3.\\n- Dequeue node 3 and check its neighbors. Node 3 has neighbors 5 and 6. Node 5 is our target, so we have found the shortest path.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 2 to node 5 is through node 3.
