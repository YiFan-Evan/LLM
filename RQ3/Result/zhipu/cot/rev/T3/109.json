BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.\\n\\nHere's the thought process for applying BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, keep track of the parent of each node so that we can reconstruct the path once we reach the target node.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and process it:\\n   - If it's the target node, reconstruct the path using the parent pointers.\\n   - Otherwise, for each of its unvisited neighbors, add them to the queue and set their parent to the current node.\\n5. Once we reach the target node, we can stop the search.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this process to the given graph, starting at node 7 and aiming to reach node 11:\\n\\n- Start at node 7, add it to the queue.\\n- Dequeue node 7, mark it as visited. Its neighbors are nodes 8 and 9.\\n- Enqueue nodes 8 and 9.\\n- Dequeue node 8, mark it as visited. Its parent is node 7. It has no unvisited neighbors.\\n- Dequeue node 9, mark it as visited. Its parent is node 7. It has no unvisited neighbors.\\n- Now, enqueue node 12 (from node 0) which is a neighbor of the start node and has not been visited yet.\\n- Dequeue node 12, mark it as visited. Its parent is node 0. Its unvisited neighbors are nodes 2 and 5.\\n- Enqueue nodes 2 and 5.\\n- Dequeue node 2, mark it as visited. Its parent is node 12. It has one unvisited neighbor, node 1.\\n- Enqueue node 1.\\n- Dequeue node 5, mark it as visited. Its parent is node 12. Its unvisited neighbors are nodes 3 and 6.\\n- Enqueue nodes 3 and 6.\\n- Dequeue node 1, mark it as visited. Its parent is node 2. It has one unvisited neighbor, node 11, which is the target node.\\n- Enqueue node 11.\\n- Dequeue node 11, mark it as visited. We have reached the target node, so we reconstruct the path from node 11 to the start node using the parent pointers.\\n\\nReconstructing the path from node 11, we find that its parent is node 1, whose parent is node 2, whose parent is node 12, whose parent is node 0, and whose parent is node 7.

BFS is appropriate because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph by exploring all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's how we would apply BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Start at node 7, enqueue it, and mark it as visited.\\n2. Dequeue node 7, and explore its neighbors: nodes 8 and 9.\\n3. Enqueue unvisited neighbors of node 7, which are nodes 8 and 9, and mark them as visited.\\n4. Dequeue node 8, and since node 1 is not a neighbor of node 8, there is no path from node 8 to node 1.
