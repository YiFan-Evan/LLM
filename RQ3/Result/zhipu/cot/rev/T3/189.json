BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertex neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is particularly suitable for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is done so via the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process using BFS:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node and a dictionary to keep track of the visited nodes and their parents.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the target, we stop and backtrack from the target to the start using the parent pointers to reconstruct the path.\\n    c. Otherwise, for each neighbor of this node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, set its parent to the current node, and enqueue it.\\n3.
