BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's how we can apply BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the paths taken to reach each node.\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and examine its edges.\\n3. For each edge, if the destination node has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Also, record the path taken to reach this node by appending the current node to the path of the destination node found in the dictionary.\\n4. Repeat the process until we reach the target node or the queue is empty.\\n5. Once we reach the target node, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the start node to the target node using the dictionary.\\n\\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph, with the start node as 3 and the destination as 0:\\n\\n- Initialize the queue with the start node 3 and an empty dictionary for paths.\\n- Dequeue 3, and examine its edges: [3, 4], [3, 7].\\n- Visit 4 and 7, mark them as visited, and record the path to them (3->4 and 3->7).\\n- Dequeue 4 and examine its edges: [3, 4] (already visited), so we do nothing.\\n- Dequeue 7 and examine its edges: [3, 7] (already visited), so we do nothing.\\n- Now, we have to go back to the nodes connected to the start node 0: [0, 5], [0, 3], [0, 10].\\n- Since we've already visited 3, we look at 5 and 10. However, these nodes are not directly connected to 3 or 7, so we have to backtrack.\\n- We backtrack to node 3 and realize that we haven't explored all possible paths. We need to continue exploring paths from the nodes that were reached from 3, which are 4 and 7.\\n- From node 4, we do not find a direct connection to 0, so we continue with node 7.\\n- We check node 7 again and notice that we haven't explored the edge [3, 7] leading to 0 yet. Since we are looking for the shortest path and we are at node 7 which has an edge to 0, we have found our shortest path.\\n\\nReconstructing the path from the target node back to the start node using the paths recorded in the dictionary, we get:\\n\\n- We know that we reached 0 directly from 3.\\n- The path to 3 is just [3] since it's the start node.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->0\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 3], [0, 10], [1, 10], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 7], [6, 8], [8, 10], [9, 12], [10, 11], [10, 12]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 7).\\n- Dequeue 4 and examine its edges: [3, 4] (already visited), so we do nothing.\\n- Dequeue 7 and examine its edges: [3, 7] (already visited), so we do nothing.\\n- Now, we have to go back to the nodes connected to the start node 0: [0, 5], [0, 3], [0, 10].\\n- Since we've already visited 3, we look at 5 and 10.
