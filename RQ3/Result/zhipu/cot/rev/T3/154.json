BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is particularly good for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is done so via the shortest path.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n\\n```\\n{'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14],\\n 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 1], [0, 14], [1, 8], [1, 4], [2, 6], [2, 14], [4, 12], [5, 6], [7, 8], [9, 13], [10, 11], [11, 14], [13, 14]]}\\n```\\n\\nThe start node is 11, and the destination is 12.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process using BFS:\\n\\n1.
