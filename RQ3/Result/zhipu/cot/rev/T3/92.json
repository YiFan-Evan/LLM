I incorrectly stated that there was a direct edge from node 3 to node 6. Let's correct this and find the shortest path from node 3 to node 6 using a correct approach.\\n\\nTo find the shortest path, we can use either Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS) since all edges can be considered to have equal weight (which simplifies the process). I will describe the process using BFS, which is well-suited for unweighted graphs:\\n\\n1. Start at the starting node (node 3) and mark it as visited.\\n2. Explore all of its neighbors at the present depth (which are nodes 6 in this case) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n3. Since we are looking for the shortest path in an unweighted graph, we can simply follow the edges and keep track of the path taken.\\n\\nLet's walk through the steps:\\n\\n- Start at node 3.\\n- Node 3 has a direct edge to node 6.\\n- There is no need to go through any other nodes to reach node 6 from node 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 6 is directly from node 3 to node 6.\\n\\nSo the final answer is: 3->6\""}]
