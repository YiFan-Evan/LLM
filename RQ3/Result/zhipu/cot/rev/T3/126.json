Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to explore and a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node. The dictionary will map each node to its predecessor, which allows us to reconstruct the path later.\\n\\n2. Enqueue the start node and mark it as visited by adding it to the dictionary with no predecessor (or a special marker such as None).\\n\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore all of its neighbors. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited by adding it to the dictionary with the current node as its predecessor and enqueue it.\\n\\n4.
