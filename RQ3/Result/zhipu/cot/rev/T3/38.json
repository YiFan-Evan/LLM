Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity except for the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a min-heap) and insert the start node with a distance of 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest distance.\\n   b.
