BFS is suitable for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has done so via the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process for applying BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (13) and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node. This dictionary will map each node to its parent node in the shortest path.\\n\\n2.

Repeat step 2 until the target node (6) is dequeued from the queue, or the queue is empty (which would mean the target is not reachable).\\n\\n4. Once the target node is found, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent pointers in the dictionary to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\n5.
