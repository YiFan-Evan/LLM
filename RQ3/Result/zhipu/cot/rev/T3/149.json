Initialize a priority queue and start by adding the start node (2 in this case) with a distance of 0.\\n2. Also, initialize a distances dictionary with all nodes having an infinite distance except the start node, which has a distance of 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\\n   a. Dequeue the node with the smallest distance.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through the current node.\\n   c. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the shortest distance and enqueue the neighbor with this new distance.\\n4. Keep track of the path by storing the previous node for each node visited.\\n5. Once the destination node is dequeued, backtrack from the destination node to the start node using the stored previous nodes to find the shortest path.\\n\\nNow let's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\\n- Edges: [[0, 10], [0, 13], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 10], [4, 9], [5, 13], [6, 13], [7, 12], [7, 13], [8, 11], [8, 13], [8, 14]]\\n\\nStarting at node 2 and looking for the shortest path to node 5, we would proceed as follows:\\n\\n- The neighbors of node 2 are node 6.\\n- The distance to node 6 from node 2 is 1 edge.\\n- Node 6's neighbors are node 13.\\n- The distance to node 13 from node 6 is 1 edge.\\n- Node 13's neighbors include node 5.\\n- The distance to node 5 from node 13 is 1 edge.\\n\\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 2 to node 5 is 2 -> 6 -> 13 -> 5.\\n\\nHowever, it seems I made a mistake in my reasoning. Node 5 is not a direct neighbor of node 13. I must re-evaluate the path from node 13 to node 5. Let's backtrack and see if there's another way to reach node 5 from node 13 that involves fewer edges:\\n\\n- From node 13, we have edges to nodes 0, 5, and 6.\\n- Since we're looking for the shortest path to node 5, and node 5 is directly connected to node 13, we can simply take this edge.\\n\\nThus, the shortest path from node 2 to node 5 is actually 2 -> 6 -> 13 -> 5.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->6->13->5\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 13], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 10], [4, 9], [5, 13], [6, 13], [7, 12], [7, 13], [8, 11], [8, 13], [8, 14]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 13"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from node 2 to node 13, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar approach, such as breadth-first search (BFS), since all edges can be considered to have equal weight (cost of 1 edge).\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process:\\n\\n1.
