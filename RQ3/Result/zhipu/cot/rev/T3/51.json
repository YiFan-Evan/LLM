It seems the destination was not specified in the last message. Let's assume the destination node is 5, as per the first example provided.\\n\\nTo find the shortest path from the start node (2) to the destination node (5) in the given graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or a simple breadth-first search (BFS) since all edges are unweighted.
