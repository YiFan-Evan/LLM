It seems there was a misunderstanding regarding the destination node. You mentioned the destination as \\\"To find the shortest path from the start node (2) to the destination (6),\\\" but then you repeated the start node (2) instead of providing the path to the destination node (6).\\n\\nLet's correct this and find the shortest path from node 2 to node 6 using Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar approach, considering that the graph is an undirected graph with the given edges:\\n\\n```\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 7], [2, 5], [2, 6], [3, 5], [4, 6], [4, 7]]}\\nStart node: 2\\nDestination node: 6\\n```\\n\\nTo find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a simple list in this case) to keep track of nodes to visit, starting with the start node.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the node with the smallest distance.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, if the distance to the neighbor through the current node is less than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and enqueue the neighbor.\\n4. Once the destination node is dequeued, the shortest path has been found.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 2, set its distance to 0.\\n- Node 2 has edges to nodes 5 and 6.\\n- The distance to node 5 is 1 (the edge itself), and the distance to node 6 is 1 (the edge itself).\\n- Since both distances are the same, we can choose either node 5 or node 6 to visit next. Let's choose node 6.\\n- Node 6 has edges to nodes 4 and 2. Since we came from node 2, we don't consider the edge back to node 2.\\n- There is no edge from node 6 to node 5, so we don't update the distance to node 5 from node 6.\\n- The shortest path from node 2 to node 6 is directly through the edge (2, 6).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n2->6\""}]
