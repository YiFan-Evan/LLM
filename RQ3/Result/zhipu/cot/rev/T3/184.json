However, we need to find a way to get from node 0 to node 1 first.\\n\\nLooking at the edges, we see that node 1 is connected to node 3 via the edge [1, 3]. To get to node 1 from node 0, we can use the edge [0, 7] to get to node 7, and then from node 7 there is no direct edge to node 1, so we continue exploring. We find that node 1 is connected to node 3, and we don't need to go through any other nodes to reach node 3 from node 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 0 to node 3 is directly through node 1.
