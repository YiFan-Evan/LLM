This algorithm is a common choice for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights, which is implied here since the edge weights are not provided and thus assumed to be uniform or unit weights.\\n\\nLet's walk through the steps of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a set in some implementations) to keep track of the nodes that need to be explored, starting with the start node.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance from the start node through the current node. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\\n   c. Keep track of the path by storing the predecessor of each node.\\n\\nSince I cannot execute code, I'll describe the process conceptually:\\n\\n- Start with node 10, with a distance of 0.\\n- Explore the neighbors of node 10 (which are node 12), and update the distances to the neighbors if the path through the start node is shorter.\\n- Move to the next unvisited node with the smallest distance, which will be node 12, with a distance of 1 from the start node.\\n- Explore the neighbors of node 12 (which is node 10, but it's already visited, so we skip it).\\n- Continue this process, visiting the nodes in order of their distance from the start node, until we reach node 3.\\n\\nNow, let's imagine running this algorithm on the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 10, mark it with distance 0.\\n- Move to node 12 (distance 1 from 10).\\n- There are no other nodes to visit from node 12 that haven't been visited with a shorter path.\\n- Go back to the previous node with the smallest distance, which leads us to node 10, but since we came from node 12, we don't need to explore it again.\\n- Continue this process, and eventually, we will reach node 3.\\n\\nFor this specific graph, since we don't have actual distances, we assume each edge has the same weight.
