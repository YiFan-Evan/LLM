Since the graph provided does not specify weights for the edges, we will assume that each edge has a weight of 1 for simplicity.\\n\\nThe algorithm works by maintaining a set of nodes whose shortest distance from the source is known and a set of nodes whose shortest distance is unknown. It repeatedly selects the node with the smallest known distance, updates the distances of its neighbors, and continues this process until the destination node is reached or all nodes are processed.\\n\\nHere's the thought process using Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize the distances from the start node to all other nodes as infinity, except for the start node itself, which is 0.\\n2. Set the start node as the current node.\\n3.
