Initialize a queue with the start node and a dictionary to keep track of the paths taken to reach each node.\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n3. For each neighbor of this node, if it has not been visited yet, record the path to reach it by appending the current node to the path found so far.\\n4. Enqueue the neighbor with its new path.\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the target node is dequeued, which means the shortest path has been found.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start with the node 6 in the queue. The paths dictionary is empty.\\n- Dequeue node 6 and examine its edges. Node 0 is connected to node 6, so we record the path to node 0 as 6->0 and enqueue node 0 with this path.\\n- Next, dequeue node 0. Node 3 is connected to node 0, so we record the path to node 3 as 6->0->3 and enqueue node 3 with this path. Node 3 is also connected to node 7, but we don't enqueue it since we're looking for the path to node 1.\\n- Dequeue node 3. Node 1 is not directly connected to node 3, so we continue searching.\\n- Since node 1 is connected to node 4 and node 2, we need to go back to the previous layers to find the path that includes node 1.\\n- We find that node 1 was enqueued from node 1->2 and node 1->4. We choose the shortest path which is 6->0->3->7 (since there is no direct connection from 3 to 1, we have to go through 7).\\n- Now we see that node 1 is connected to node 4, so we take the path 6->0->3->7->1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->0->3->7->1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 7]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node to the destination, I will once again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, as it is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process:\\n\\n1.
