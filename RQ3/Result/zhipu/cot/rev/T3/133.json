BFS is a good choice because it explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Initialize a queue and add the start node (4) to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\\n3. Also, maintain a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent, which will help us backtrack the path once we reach the target node.\\n\\nNow, let's simulate the BFS process:\\n\\n- Start with node 4 in the queue. Its neighbors are nodes 9 and 2.\\n- Visit node 9 first (since the order in which we process neighbors doesn't matter for unweighted graphs), mark it as visited, and enqueue it. Keep track that 4 is the parent of 9.\\n- Then visit node 2, mark it as visited, and enqueue it. Keep track that 4 is the parent of 2.\\n- Dequeue node 9 and explore its neighbors. Node 3 is a neighbor of 9, so visit it, mark it as visited, and enqueue it, noting that 9 is the parent of 3. Node 4 is already visited, so we skip it.\\n- Dequeue node 2 and explore its neighbors. Node 12 is a neighbor of 2, so we have reached our destination.\\n- Now backtrack from node 12 to the start node using the parent pointers.
