BFS is a good fit because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the thought process using BFS to find the shortest path from node 13 to node 10:\\n\\n1. Start at the initial node (node 13).\\n2. Create a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, it's just `[13]`).\\n3. Dequeue the first element from the queue and examine its neighbors.\\n4. For each neighbor, if it hasn't been visited yet, enqueue it with the updated path that includes this neighbor.\\n5. Repeat this process until the target node (node 10) is dequeued from the queue.\\n6. The path associated with the target node when it is dequeued will be the shortest path from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nLet's walk through the steps:\\n\\n- Start at node 13. Enqueue `[13]`.\\n- Dequeue `[13]`. Node 13 has one edge to node 14. Enqueue `[13->14]`.\\n- Dequeue `[13->14]`. Node 14 has one edge to node 2 and another to node 7. Enqueue `[13->14->2]` and `[13->14->7]`.\\n- Dequeue `[13->14->2]`. Node 2 has edges to nodes 5 and 14 (which is the parent node and thus we skip it to avoid cycles). Enqueue `[13->14->2->5]`.\\n- Dequeue `[13->14->2->5]`. Node 5 has edges to nodes 10 and 11. Enqueue `[13->14->2->5->10]` and `[13->14->2->5->11]`.\\n- Dequeue `[13->14->2->5->10]`.
