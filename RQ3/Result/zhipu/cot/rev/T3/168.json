BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertex neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It's a suitable algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it guarantees that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process for BFS:\\n\\n1.
