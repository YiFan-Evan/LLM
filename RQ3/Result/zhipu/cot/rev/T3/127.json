BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process to apply BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (10).\\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue the next node from the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the destination (6), we stop and backtrack to find the path.\\n    c. Otherwise, for each of its unvisited neighbors, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\\n4. Once we reach the destination node, backtrack using the visited nodes to construct the path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\nStarting at node 10, the BFS will explore nodes 11 and 14 (since they are directly connected to node 10). From node 14, it will explore node 3, and from node 11, it will explore node 10 again (but this node has already been visited, so it will not be enqueued again). From node 3, it will explore node 0, and from node 0, it will explore node 13 and node 3 (node 3 is already visited, so it will not be enqueued again). From node 13, it will explore node 5 and node 0 (node 0 is already visited, so it will not be enqueued again). From node 5, it will explore node 6 and node 13 (node 6 is the destination).\\n\\nAt this point, we have reached the destination node 6. Now we backtrack to construct the path. The path from node 6 to node 10 is: 6->5->13->0->3->14->10.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->14->3->0->13->5->6\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 13], [0, 3], [1, 9], [1, 6], [2, 8], [3, 14], [4, 12], [4, 8], [5, 6], [5, 13], [7, 9], [8, 10], [10, 11], [10, 14]]} The start node: 10 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from node 10 to node 5 in the given graph, we can again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
