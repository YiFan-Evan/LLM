BFS is a good choice because it explores the neighbors of a node at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic ensures that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step thought process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (3 in this case) and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path found to each node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a.

Node 0 is now dequeued, and since it's our target, we reconstruct the path. Node 0's predecessor is 4, and node 4's predecessor is 3.
