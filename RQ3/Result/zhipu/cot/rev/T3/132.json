The BFS algorithm explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nLet's go through the steps of BFS:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes. The queue will store tuples of (node, path), where 'path' is the path taken to reach the node.\\n2. Add the start node to the queue with the path containing just the start node.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue an element (node, path).\\n4. If the current node is the destination, we have found our shortest path.\\n5. If the current node is not the destination, for each of its unvisited neighbors, add the neighbor to the queue with the updated path.\\n6. Mark the current node as visited.\\n7.
