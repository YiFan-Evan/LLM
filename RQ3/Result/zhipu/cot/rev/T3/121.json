Initialize a set of unvisited nodes and assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for the initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n2. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For our edges, since there are no weights given, we'll assume each edge has a weight of 1.\\n4. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited (when it becomes the current node), we have completed our search.\\n6.

Node 2 is already visited, and we found node 10 with a distance of 1, so we check node 12 which will have a distance of 2.\\n- Now, we move to the unvisited node with the smallest distance, which is node 12.\\n- From node 12, there are no direct connections to the destination node 4, so we look at the other unvisited neighbors. We see node 9 and node 14, both with a distance of 3.\\n- Next, we choose either node 9 or node 14 as the next node to process. Let's choose node 9. From node 9, there is a direct connection to node 4 with a distance of 1. So, node 4's distance is now 4.\\n- Since node 4 is our target and we've found a path to it, we stop the search.\\n\\nNow we backtrack from the destination node (4) to the start node (2) to construct the path:\\n\\n- Node 4 was reached from node 9, which was reached from node 12, and node 12 was reached from node 10, which was reached from node 2.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->10->12->9->4\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 11], [0, 10], [2, 10], [3, 13], [3, 4], [4, 10], [5, 9], [6, 14], [7, 11], [8, 13], [9, 12], [9, 14], [10, 12]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from start node 2 to destination node 9, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm.
