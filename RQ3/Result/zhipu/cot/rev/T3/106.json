From node 12, we can go to node 6.\\n\\nWe can see that node 8 is directly connected to node 6, and node 6 is not directly connected to node 3. However, node 3 is directly connected to nodes 10 and 11, so we need to backtrack and find a connection from node 6 to node 3.\\n\\n4. We notice that there are no direct edges from node 6 to node 3, but node 3 is connected to node 10 and node 11, which in turn are connected to node 4 and node 2, respectively.\\n5.

From node 4, there is no direct connection to node 3, but node 11 is connected to node 4, and node 11 is directly connected to node 3.\\n\\nNow, we backtrack from node 3 to find the shortest path:\\n\\n- Node 3 is directly connected to node 11.\\n- Node 11 is directly connected to node 4.\\n- Node 4 is directly connected to node 2.\\n- Node 2 is not directly connected to node 3, but we need to go back to node 4 and then to node 11 to reach node 3.\\n- Node 6 is directly connected to node 8, and node 8 is our starting point.\\n\\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 8 to node 3 is:\\n\\n8 -> 6 -> 4 -> 11 -> 3\\n\\nSo the final answer is: 8->6->4->11->3\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 6], [1, 7], [1, 9], [2, 4], [3, 10], [3, 11], [3, 8], [4, 11], [5, 9], [6, 8], [6, 12]]} The start node: 8 The destination: 11"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node (8) to the destination (11), we can follow the edges from the start node and keep track of the path until we reach the destination node.
