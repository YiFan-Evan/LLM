BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It's a good fit for this task because it naturally finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step thought process for applying BFS to find the shortest path from node 18 to node 15:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (18) and a dictionary to keep track of the paths to each node (we'll call this `paths`).\\n\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node and examine its neighbors.\\n\\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, if it is not in `paths`, add it to the queue and record the path to reach it by appending the current node to the path that leads to the current node.\\n\\n4. Keep doing this until we find the target node (15) in our `paths` dictionary.\\n\\n5. Once we find the target node, we can reconstruct the path by following the recorded paths.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this process to the provided graph:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom collections import deque\\n\\n# Graph representation\\nnodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\\nedges = [[0, 7], [0, 8], [1, 14], [2, 9], [3, 14], [3, 24], [4, 24], [5, 12], [5, 22], [6, 16], [6, 7], [8, 13], [8, 14], [9, 22], [9, 17], [10, 21], [10, 22], [11, 23], [11, 16], [12, 19], [15, 21], [17, 20], [18, 23], [20, 23]]\\n\\n# Create adjacency list from edges\\nadjacency_list = {node: [] for node in nodes}\\nfor edge in edges:\\n    adjacency_list[edge[0]].append(edge[1])\\n    adjacency_list[edge[1]].append(edge[0])\\n\\n# BFS to find shortest path\\ndef bfs(start, end):\\n    queue = deque([start])\\n    paths = {start: [start]}\\n    while queue:\\n        current_node = queue.popleft()\\n        for neighbor in adjacency_list[current_node]:\\n            if neighbor not in paths:\\n                paths[neighbor] = paths[current_node] + [neighbor]\\n                queue.append(neighbor)\\n                if neighbor == end:\\n                    return paths[neighbor]\\n    return []\\n\\n# Start and end nodes\\nstart_node = 18\\nend_node = 15\\n\\n# Perform BFS to find shortest path from start_node to end_node\\nshortest_path = bfs(start_node, end_node)\\n\\n# Format the path as a string \\\"1->2->3->...\\\"\\npath_string = '->'.join(map(str, shortest_path))\\n\\n# Output the result\\nprint(f\\\"Therefore, the final answer is: {path_string}\\\")\\n```\\n\\nIf we run the above code, it would output the shortest path from node 18 to node 15 in the specified format.
