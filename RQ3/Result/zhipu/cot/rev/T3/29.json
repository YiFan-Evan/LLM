BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the first node from the queue and check if it is the target node.\\n4. If it is the target node, we have found our shortest path.\\n5.
