BFS is suitable for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the thought process for applying BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node (1 in this case).\\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\\n3. For each node, record the node that led to its discovery (this will help reconstruct the path later).\\n4. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\\n5. When the destination node is dequeued, reconstruct the path by following the chain of discovery nodes back to the start node.\\n\\nLet's apply this process to the given graph.\\n\\nStarting from node 1:\\n- Enqueue node 1 (queue: [1])\\n- Dequeue 1, enqueue neighbors 2 and 11 (queue: [2, 11])\\n- Dequeue 2, enqueue neighbor 1 (queue: [11, 1]) - but 1 is already visited\\n- Dequeue 11, enqueue neighbors 2 and 5 (queue: [1, 5]) - but 2 is already visited\\n- Dequeue 1, no new neighbors to enqueue (queue: [5])\\n- Dequeue 5, enqueue neighbors 4 and 8 (queue: [4, 8])\\n- Dequeue 4, enqueue neighbor 5 (queue: [8]) - but 5 is already visited\\n- Dequeue 8, enqueue neighbors 5 and 12 (queue: [12]) - but 5 is already visited\\n- Dequeue 12, no new neighbors to enqueue (queue is empty)\\n\\nAt this point, we have reached the destination node 5, and we can reconstruct the path. We know that node 5 was reached from node 4, node 4 was reached from node 5 (but we go in the opposite direction), and node 1 was the starting node.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2->11->5\\n\\nHowever, this path is not correct according to the graph provided. I made an error in the path reconstruction. Let's correct it:\\n\\nNode 5 was reached from node 4, node 4 was reached from node 5 (but we go in the opposite direction), and node 1 was the starting node.
