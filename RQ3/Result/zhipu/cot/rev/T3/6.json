BFS is a good fit for this task because it explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which guarantees that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step process to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored and a dictionary (or a list of lists) to keep track of the shortest path found so far. The path can be represented by a dictionary mapping each node to its parent node in the path.\\n2. Start by adding the starting node (1) to the queue and marking it as visited by adding it to the path dictionary with a `None` parent to indicate that it's the start of the path.\\n3. Loop until the queue is empty:\\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   - For each of its adjacent nodes, if the node has not been visited (i.e., not in the path dictionary):\\n     - Add it to the queue.\\n     - Mark it as visited by adding it to the path dictionary with the current node as its parent.\\n4. If we reach the target node during this process, we can stop the search.\\n5. Once the target node is found, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent references to reconstruct the path.\\n6.
