It keeps a set of unvisited vertices and calculates tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths. Here's a step-by-step process for the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize distances from the start node to all other nodes as infinity, except the start node itself, which is zero.\\n2. Set the start node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and select the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance as the new \\\"current node.\\\"\\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the destination node is marked as visited.\\n\\nGiven the graph and the start node (6), let's apply the algorithm:\\n\\n- Start at node 6 with a distance of 0.\\n- Node 6 has edges to nodes 0 and 4. The distance to node 0 is 1 (direct edge), and the distance to node 4 is also 1 (direct edge).\\n- Since both nodes 0 and 4 are at the same distance from node 6, we can choose either to visit next. Let's choose node 4.\\n- From node 4, we can go to nodes 5 and 6. However, we've already visited node 6, so we look at node 5. The distance to node 5 from node 6 is 2 (6 -> 4 -> 5), which is shorter than the current known distance to node 5 (which is infinity).\\n- Now we visit node 5, and from node 5, we can go to node 1. The distance to node 1 from node 5 is 2 (5 -> 1), which is shorter than the current known distance to node 1 (which is infinity).\\n- We visit node 1, and there are no more nodes to visit from node 1 that would give us a shorter path to any unvisited nodes.\\n- Now we need to go back to node 4, as it has not been fully processed. However, since we have found a path to node 0 with a distance of 2 (6 -> 4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 0), and there are no other nodes to visit from node 4 that would give us a shorter path to node 0, we are done.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->4->5->1->0\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 2], [1, 5], [2, 7], [3, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node 6 to the destination node 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar shortest path algorithm.
