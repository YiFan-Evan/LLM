BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It's suitable for this task because it finds the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.\\n\\nHere's the process for finding the shortest path from node 5 to node 2:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node (5).\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node (2). If it is, we have found our shortest path.\\n    b. If it's not the target node, mark it as visited.\\n    c. For each edge connected to this node, if the destination node of the edge has not been visited, enqueue it and record the node from which it was reached.\\n4. Once the target node is dequeued, backtrack through the recorded nodes to find the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the graph:\\n\\n- Start from node 5.\\n- Visit node 9 (from edge [5, 9]), and continue.\\n- Visit node 0 (from edge [0, 5]), and continue.\\n- Visit node 9 again, but it's already visited, so skip it.\\n- Visit node 6 (from edge [6, 9]), and continue.\\n- Visit node 8 (from edge [8, 9]), and continue.\\n- Visit node 9 again, but it's already visited, so skip it.\\n- Now we visit node 2 (from edge [2, 12]), which is our target.\\n\\nTo backtrack the path, we can use the parent pointers that we would have set up during BFS traversal.
