Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (6) along with the path to reach it (which is just [6] at this point).\\n2. Dequeue the first element from the queue. This is our current node to explore.\\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it along with the path to reach it.\\n4. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n5.

Dequeue node 6 and explore its neighbors, which are nodes 0 and 10.\\n3. We reach node 10 directly from node 6, so the path is [6, 10].\\n\\nSince we reached the destination node 10 from node 6 directly, the shortest path is 6->10.
