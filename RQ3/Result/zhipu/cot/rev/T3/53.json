BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the thought process for applying BFS to the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (6 in this case), also keeping track of the path taken to reach this node (initially just the start node).\\n2. Dequeue the first node from the queue and examine its neighbors.\\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet, mark it as visited, record the path taken to reach it, and enqueue it along with its path.\\n4. Repeat this process until the target node (1 in this case) is dequeued from the queue, which will mean we have found the shortest path.\\n5. Once we reach the target node, we can reconstruct the path by following the recorded paths from the target back to the start.\\n\\nLet's apply this process to the given graph:\\n\\nStarting at node 6, the BFS will proceed as follows:\\n- Enqueue node 6 with path [6].\\n- Dequeue node 6, examine neighbors: 1, 2, and 3.
