BFS is a traversal for a graph where we start at a selected node and explore all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n\\n```\\n{'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\\n 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 7], [3, 5], [4, 7], [6, 7]]}\\n```\\n\\nWe start at node 4 and want to reach node 2.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process:\\n\\n1.
