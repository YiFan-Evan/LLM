BFS is a good choice because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. The queue will store the nodes to be explored, and the visited set will keep track of the nodes that have already been visited to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n2. Enqueue the start node and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\\n4. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Also, record the node from which the neighbor was reached (this will help reconstruct the path later).\\n5. Once the target node is dequeued, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target node to the start node using the recorded nodes.\\n6. Format the path as specified.\\n\\nLet's apply this process to the given graph with the start node 6 and the destination node 5.\\n\\nStarting at node 6, we enqueue it and mark it as visited. The neighbors of 6 are 7, so we enqueue 7 and mark it as visited.\\n\\nNext, we dequeue 6 and look at the next unvisited node in the queue, which is 7. The neighbors of 7 are 3 and 6 (but 6 is already visited), so we enqueue 3 and mark it as visited.\\n\\nContinuing, we dequeue 7 and process 3. The neighbors of 3 are 2 and 7 (but 7 is already visited), so we enqueue 2 and mark it as visited.\\n\\nNow we dequeue 3 and process 2. The neighbors of 2 are 4 and 3 (but 3 is already visited), so we enqueue 4 and mark it as visited.\\n\\nWe dequeue 2 and process 4. The neighbors of 4 are 0 and 5.
