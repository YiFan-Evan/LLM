BFS explores the graph level by level and is guaranteed to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step thought process for applying BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored, and a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node.\\n2. Enqueue the starting node (8 in this case) and record its path as just `[8]`.\\n3. Dequeue the node from the front of the queue and examine its neighbors.\\n4. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet (i.e., not in the dictionary), record the path to this neighbor as the path to the current node plus the neighbor, and enqueue the neighbor.\\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the target node is dequeued from the queue, indicating that the shortest path has been found.\\n\\nLet's apply this process to the given graph, starting at node 8 and aiming to reach node 20:\\n\\n- Start with the queue: `[8]` and the path dictionary: `{8: [8]}`\\n- Node 8 has neighbors 6 and 1. Node 6 is already in the path dictionary, but node 1 is not, so we add it: `{8: [8], 1: [8, 1]}` and enqueue node 1.\\n- Next, we look at node 1, which has neighbor 8 (which is already visited) and neighbor 8 (which is the starting node and also already visited), so we move on.\\n- We then explore node 6, which has neighbors 8 and 21. Node 8 is already visited, but node 21 is not, so we add it: `{8: [8], 1: [8, 1], 21: [8, 6, 21]}` and enqueue node 21.\\n- We continue with node 21, which has neighbors 11, 12, and 19. None of these have been visited, so we add paths to each: `{8: [8], 1: [8, 1], 21: [8, 6, 21], 11: [8, 6, 21, 11], 12: [8, 6, 21, 12], 19: [8, 6, 21, 19]}` and enqueue nodes 11, 12, and 19.\\n- When we reach node 19, we find that it has neighbors 7, 13, 22, 20, and 21. Node 20 is our target, and it has not been visited yet, so we add the path to it: `{8: [8], 1: [8, 1], 21: [8, 6, 21], 11: [8, 6, 21, 11], 12: [8, 6, 21, 12], 19: [8, 6, 21, 19], 20: [8, 6, 21, 19, 20]}`.\\n\\nSince we have reached our target node 20, we can stop here.
