BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the neighbors of a node at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, thereby guaranteeing that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path to it.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the steps we will take:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the visited nodes and their predecessors.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node from the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we can stop and reconstruct the path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its neighbors, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its predecessor, and enqueue it.\\n3. Once we reach the target node, backtrack from the target to the start node using the recorded predecessors to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\\n\\n1. Start at node 12.\\n2. Visit node 15 (through edge [12, 15]), then node 19 (through edge [15, 19]), and node 20 (through edge [14, 20]), and so on.\\n3.
