BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process for applying BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node (12) to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3.

While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and check if it is the destination (6). If it is, we stop.\\n5. If it's not the destination, mark the node as visited and enqueue all its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet, recording their parent as the current node.\\n6. Once we reach the destination, backtrack from the destination node to the start node using the parent pointers to construct the path.\\n\\nLet's apply this process to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 12, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (11 and 0).\\n- Dequeue node 11, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (14, 7, and 8).\\n- Dequeue node 0, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (which are none in this case since all are visited or not connected).\\n- Dequeue node 14, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (which are none in this case).\\n- Dequeue node 7, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (which are 2 and 5).\\n- Dequeue node 8, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (which is 11, but it's already visited).\\n- Dequeue node 2, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbor (which is 3).\\n- Dequeue node 5, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (which are 1 and 13).\\n- Dequeue node 3, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbor (which is 4).\\n- Dequeue node 1, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbor (which is 5, but it's already visited).\\n- Dequeue node 13, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (which are none in this case).\\n- Dequeue node 4, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbor (which is 12, but it's already visited).\\n- Now, we reach node 6, which is our destination.
