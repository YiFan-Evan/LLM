Let's take 1 (the order does not matter as both have the same distance).\\n5. Node 1 has no neighbors that are directly connected to the start node with a shorter path, so we move to node 3.\\n6. Node 3 has neighbors 2, 5, and 7. Update their distances: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: inf, 5: 2, 6: inf, 7: 2}\\n7. Continue with the node with the smallest distance. Next, it's node 2.\\n8.

In this simple example, we did not track the previous nodes, but since we only updated the distance for a node when we found a shorter path, we can infer the path by following the shortest distance path.\\n\\nStarting at node 6, we see that the shortest distance to it is from node 7, so we go from 6 to 7. The shortest distance to node 7 is from node 3, so we go from 7 to 3.

Node 4 has a neighbor 6. Since we came from 6 to 4, we don't need to update the distance to 6.\\n6. Move to node 7.
