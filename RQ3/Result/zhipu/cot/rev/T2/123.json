This algorithm is efficient for graphs with non-negative edge weights, and it works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the steps I'll take:\\n\\n1. Initialize a set of unvisited nodes and assign to each node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n2. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited, we are done; the shortest path has been found.\\n6. If the destination node has not been marked visited, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 3.\\n\\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\\n\\n1.

Update their distances if the path through 2 is shorter.\\n   - Distance to 4 through 2 is 1 (since there is an edge between 2 and 4), which is shorter than the current distance of inf. Update distance[4] to 1.\\n   - Distance to 7 through 2 is 1 (since there is an edge between 2 and 7), which is shorter than the current distance of inf. Update distance[7] to 1.\\n4. Mark 2 as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\\n5. New current node is the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance. Now it's either 4 or 7. Let's choose 4.\\n6. Neighbors of 4 are 5 and 12. Update their distances if the path through 4 is shorter.\\n   - Distance to 5 through 4 is 1 (since there is an edge between 4 and 5), which is shorter than the current distance of inf. Update distance[5] to 1.\\n   - Distance to 12 through 4 is 1 (since there is an edge between 4 and 12), which is shorter than the current distance of inf. Update distance[12] to 1.\\n7. Mark 4 as visited.\\n8. The new current node is now 5 or 12. We choose 5 because it has a distance of 1, the same as 12, but was considered first.\\n9. Node 5 has no unvisited neighbors that can provide a shorter path, so we move on to node 12, which is the next unvisited node with the smallest distance.\\n10.
