Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's apply this to our graph:\\n\\n1. Starting at node 10, we assign it a distance of 0 and all other nodes a distance of infinity.\\n2. Node 10 is connected to node 9 with an edge. Since there are no other nodes connected to 10, we set the distance to node 9 as 1 (the length of the edge).\\n3. We move to node 9, which has the smallest tentative distance. Node 9 is connected to node 10 with a distance of 1, and node 0 with a distance of 1. Node 0's current distance is infinity, so we update it to 2.\\n4. Next, we move to node 0. It's connected to nodes 4 and 9. Node 4's current distance is infinity, so we update it to 3.\\n5. We proceed to node 4, and we see it's connected to node 20 with a distance of 1. We update node 20's distance to 4.\\n6. We move to node 20, and since it's directly connected to the destination node 24, we update node 24's distance to 5.\\n7. Now, node 24 is the next with the smallest tentative distance, and it's our destination. We stop the algorithm since we've reached our goal.\\n\\nHowever, we've found the shortest path to node 24, not node 18. Let's backtrack from node 24 to node 18 using the distances we've calculated:\\n\\n- Node 24 was reached from node 20, so we go back to node 20.\\n- Node 20 was reached from node 4, so we go back to node 4.\\n- Node 4 was reached from node 0, so we go back to node 0.\\n- Node 0 was reached from node 9, so we go back to node 9.\\n- Node 9 was reached from node 10, so we go back to node 10.\\n\\nWe have now traced the shortest path from node 10 to node 18 through nodes 9, 0, 4, and 20. So the shortest path is:\\n\\n10->9->0->4->20\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->9->0->4->20->18\\n\\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in my reasoning because I did not check for a direct connection from any of these nodes to node 18. I must have missed that node 18 is directly connected to node 5, which is connected to node 17, which is connected to node 8, which leads directly to node 10.
