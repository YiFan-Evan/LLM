Enqueue the starting node 21 and mark it as visited.\\n2. Dequeue a node and explore its neighbors. If the target node is found, we can stop.\\n3. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited, record the node that led to it (to reconstruct the path later), and enqueue it.\\n\\nLet's simulate this process:\\n\\n```\\nfrom collections import deque\\n\\n# Graph adjacency list\\ngraph = {\\n    # ...

The correct BFS traversal should give us the shortest path without revisiting nodes.
