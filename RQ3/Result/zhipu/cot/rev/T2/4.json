BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the neighbors of a node at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, which guarantees that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's how the BFS algorithm would work for this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Keep a dictionary to record the parent of each node.
