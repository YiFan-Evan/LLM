Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node (4), which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or simply a list in this case, since the graph is small) and add the start node (with distance 0) to it.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\\n    a. Remove the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\\n    b. Consider all edges from this node to its neighbors.\\n    c. For each edge, calculate the distance through the current node to the neighbor. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and set the current node as the previous node in the path to the neighbor.\\n    d. Add the neighbor to the priority queue with the updated distance.\\n4. Once the destination node (2) is dequeued, the shortest path to it has been found.\\n\\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 4, distance to itself is 0.\\n- Node 4 has no direct edges to node 2, so we check its neighbors: there are no edges listed in the graph directly from 4 to any other node.\\n- It seems there might be an issue here. The provided graph does not include an edge from node 4 to any other node, which means node 4 is isolated in the graph.
