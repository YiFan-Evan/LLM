BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the neighbors of a node at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\\n\\nHere's the thought process to apply BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. The queue will store the nodes to be explored, and the visited set will keep track of the nodes that have already been visited to prevent processing a node more than once.\\n\\n2. Enqueue the start node (node 2 in this case) and mark it as visited.\\n\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the queue and consider it the current node.\\n   b.

Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node, if the neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited, enqueue it, and record the current node as the parent of the neighbor.\\n\\n4. Once we reach the destination node, we backtrack through the recorded parents to reconstruct the path from the start node to the destination.\\n\\nLet's apply this process to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 2.

However, we have not reached node 2 yet.\\n\\nTo continue, we need to look at the predecessors. We know that node 4 and node 5 were visited after node 6, and node 7 was visited after node 4. Now we need to backtrack from node 2, but since node 2 does not appear as a direct neighbor of any of the nodes we have visited (4, 5, 6, 7), we must have missed a step. Let's backtrack and check the neighbors of node 4 and node 5 again.\\n\\nUpon re-examination, we realize that node 2 is a neighbor of node 5, which we missed in the initial exploration. Node 5 was visited and has node 2 as an unvisited neighbor. We enqueue node 2, mark it as visited, and record node 5 as its predecessor.\\n\\n- Dequeue 2 (finally reaching the destination), and since we are looking for the shortest path, we do not need to explore any further.\\n\\nNow we can reconstruct the path by following the predecessors:\\n\\n- Node 2 was reached from node 5.\\n- Node 5 was reached from node 6.\\n\\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 6 to node 2 is:\\n\\n6->5->2\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->5->2\""}]
