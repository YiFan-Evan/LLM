Initialize a set of unvisited nodes and assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for the initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n2. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited (when we remove the current node from the unvisited set and it is the destination node), we can stop and return the shortest path.\\n6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 3.\\n\\nNow, let's apply these steps to the provided graph with the start node 16 and the destination node 2.\\n\\n1.
