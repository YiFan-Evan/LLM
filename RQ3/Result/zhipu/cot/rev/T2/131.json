Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph, starting from node 6 and aiming to reach node 13:\\n\\n1. Initialize distances: all nodes have a distance of infinity, except for the start node (6), which has a distance of 0.\\n2. Node 6 is the current node, and we look at its neighbors (11 and 14) and update their tentative distances.\\n3. Node 11 has a distance of 1 through node 6, and node 14 has a distance of 1 through node 6. Update these distances.\\n4. The smallest distance in the unvisited set is now at node 11. Node 11 becomes the current node.\\n5. Update distances for neighbors of node 11: node 12 has a new tentative distance of 2 through node 11.\\n6. The smallest distance in the unvisited set is now at node 12. Node 12 becomes the current node.\\n7. Update distances for neighbors of node 12: node 13 has a new tentative distance of 3 through node 12.\\n8. Node 13 is the destination and has been visited, so we have found the shortest path.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 6 to node 13 is 6->11->12->13.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->11->12->13\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 11], [1, 10], [2, 10], [4, 7], [4, 12], [5, 8], [5, 9], [5, 12], [6, 11], [6, 14], [7, 10], [11, 12], [12, 13]]} The start node: 13 The destination: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node (13) to the destination (6) in the given graph, we will once again use Dijkstra's algorithm.
