Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored, and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node.\\n2. Enqueue the start node (2) and set its distance to 0.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and examine it.\\n4. For each neighbor of the dequeued node, if the neighbor has not been visited (its distance is not yet set), set its distance (which is the current node's distance plus one) and enqueue it. Also, record the node that led to the neighbor to reconstruct the path later.\\n5. Once the destination node (8) is dequeued, reconstruct the path by following the recorded nodes leading up to it.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 2.

Record that we reached node 14 from node 5.\\n- Dequeue node 14. There are no unvisited nodes that are directly connected to node 14 that would lead to node 8.\\n- However, we missed that node 5 has an edge to node 14, and we already visited node 14, so we should have continued from node 4 to node 5 and then to node 8. Let's backtrack: we reached node 5 from node 4, but node 4 has no other unvisited neighbors leading to node 8. So we go back to node 2.\\n- From node 2, we haven't explored the node 4 -> node 5 -> node 8 path, so let's explore that now.\\n- We reach node 8 from node 5 with a distance of 3.
