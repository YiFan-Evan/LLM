BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores nodes in layers, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node. This will help us backtrack the path once we reach the destination.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and mark it as visited.\\n5. For each of the adjacent nodes of the current node, if the node has not been visited, add it to the queue, mark it as visited, and record its parent.\\n6.

Both are unvisited, so we enqueue them and mark them as visited.\\n- Next, we dequeue node 0. Node 0 has two neighbors: nodes 4 and 7.

Node 2 has one unvisited neighbor: node 7, but it's already visited, so we don't enqueue it again.\\n- We dequeue node 6. Node 6 has one unvisited neighbor: node 5.
