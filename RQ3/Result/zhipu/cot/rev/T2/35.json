BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path possible.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process for applying BFS to this graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (0) to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, we stop and this is our shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, mark the node as visited.\\n   d.
