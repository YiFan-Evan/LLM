Initialize distances from the start node to all other nodes as infinity, except the start node itself, which is set to zero.\\n2. Set all nodes as unvisited.\\n3. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance, and set it as the current node.\\n4. Update the distances to the neighboring nodes of the current node.\\n5. Mark the current node as visited.\\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until the target node is reached or all nodes are visited.\\n\\nLet's apply these steps to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 5. Set its distance to 0 (since it's the starting point) and all other nodes to infinity.\\n- Node 5 is connected to node 7, so update the distance to node 7 to be the distance from node 5 to node 7 (which is 1, since there is a direct edge).\\n- Now, the unvisited node with the smallest distance is node 7.\\n- From node 7, there is a direct edge to node 1. Update the distance to node 1 if it's smaller than the current distance (which it will be, since it's currently infinity).\\n- The next unvisited node with the smallest distance is node 1.\\n- From node 1, there is a direct edge to node 7, but since we've already visited node 7, we don't update anything. There is also an edge to node 0, which we update if it's smaller than the current distance.\\n- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 4, and 6. Update the distances to these nodes if the distance from node 0 is smaller than their current distances.\\n- Now, node 0 has the smallest distance among the unvisited nodes, so we proceed from node 0.\\n- From node 0, we can reach node 6 directly. Since we're looking for the shortest path to node 6, we check if the distance from node 0 to node 6 (which is 1) is less than the current known distance to node 6. If it is, we update the shortest path to node 6 to go through node 0.\\n\\nBy following these steps, we find that the shortest path from node 5 to node 6 goes through node 7 and then node 0 before reaching node 6.
