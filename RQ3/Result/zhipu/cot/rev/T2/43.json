We go back to the initial path [5] and explore the other neighbor, which is node 4. We already considered node 4, but we need to check if there is another way to reach node 6 through node 4.\\n6. We realize that from node 4, there is no direct connection to node 6, so we must have missed the direct connection from node 1 to node 6 when we were at node 1.
