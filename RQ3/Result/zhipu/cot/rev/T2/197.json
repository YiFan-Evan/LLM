Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the paths to each node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the first node and examine its neighbors.\\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet, record the path to this neighbor by appending it to the path of the current node.\\n4.
