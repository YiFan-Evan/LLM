BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is particularly suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it guarantees that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path from node 7 to node 5:\\n\\n1.
