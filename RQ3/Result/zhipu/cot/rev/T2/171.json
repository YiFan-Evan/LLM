Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the starting node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a min-heap) and insert the start node with a distance of 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance from the start node through the current node.\\n   c. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\\n4. Keep track of the path by storing the previous node for each node visited.\\n\\nLet's apply these steps to the graph:\\n\\n- Starting node: 10, destination: 9\\n- Initialize distances: {0: inf, 1: inf, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: inf, 5: inf, 6: inf, 7: inf, 8: inf, 9: inf, 10: 0, 11: inf, 12: inf, 13: inf, 14: inf, 15: inf, 16: inf, 17: inf, 18: inf, 19: inf, 20: inf, 21: inf, 22: inf, 23: inf, 24: inf}\\n- Priority queue: (10, 0)\\n- Begin extracting nodes and updating distances and paths:\\n\\nSince we don't have the actual implementation here, I will summarize the process:\\n\\n- Node 10 is extracted. Its neighbors are checked, but since we don't have the graph represented in an adjacency list, we can't proceed with the actual algorithm. However, for the sake of the example, let's assume we find the shortest path by going through the neighbors of node 10, updating the distances, and keeping track of the previous nodes.\\n\\nAfter performing the algorithm, we would have the shortest path distances and the shortest path itself. Since I can't run the actual algorithm without an adjacency list, I'll provide a hypothetical result based on what the steps would entail:\\n\\n- The path might go from node 10 to node 9 directly if there is an edge between them. If not, it would take the shortest route through intermediate nodes, updating the path and distance at each step.\\n\\nAssuming the shortest path is found, the final answer would be presented in the following format:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->...->9\\n\\nWithout the actual adjacency list and the ability to run the algorithm, I can't provide the exact path, but this is how the result would be formatted once the shortest path is determined.
