However, since the graph is small, we can also use a simple breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.\\n\\nThe idea behind BFS is to explore the graph level by level, starting from the source node, until we reach the target node. We'll keep track of the paths taken to reach each node, and when we reach the target node, we'll have the shortest path because BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's how the BFS algorithm works in this case:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with a tuple containing the start node and the path taken to reach it (initially just the start node itself).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue the next node and the path taken to reach it.\\n    b. If the current node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n    c.

Since node 3 is not directly connected to any other nodes in the provided edges, we know that we can only reach node 3 from node 4.\\n\\nLet's trace the path from node 6 to node 3:\\n- Start at 6, go to 1 (6->1)\\n- From 1, go to 4 (6->1->4)\\n- From 4, go to 3 (6->1->4->3)\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->1->4->3\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 6], [1, 4], [2, 4], [4, 5], [4, 7]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node 3 to the destination node 6, we can again use a breadth-first search (BFS) since the graph is unweighted and small.
