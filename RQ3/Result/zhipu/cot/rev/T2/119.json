BFS is a good choice because it explores the neighbors level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process on how to apply BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to track visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the queue.\\n   b. If this node has not been visited, mark it as visited.\\n   c. If this node is the destination, we've found our shortest path.\\n   d. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighbors of this node.\\n4. Keep track of the previous node for each visited node to reconstruct the path once the destination is reached.\\n\\nLet's apply this process to the given graph with start node 5 and destination 3:\\n\\n1. Start with node 5 in the queue. The visited set is empty.\\n2. Dequeue node 5, mark it as visited. Node 5 has edges to node 11.\\n3. Enqueue node 11. The visited set now contains 5.\\n4. Dequeue node 11, mark it as visited. Node 11 has edges to node 7.\\n5. Enqueue node 7. The visited set now contains 5, 11.\\n6. Dequeue node 7. There are no edges from node 7 to the destination, so we continue.\\n7. Dequeue node 6 (from the enqueueing in step 2). Mark it as visited. Node 6 has an edge to node 1.\\n8. Enqueue node 1. The visited set now contains 5, 11, 6.\\n9. Dequeue node 1. Node 1 has edges to nodes 6, 9, and 11, but they are already visited. Node 1 also has an edge to node 3, which is the destination.\\n10.
