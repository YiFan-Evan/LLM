BFS is a good fit because it explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It guarantees that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path to it.\\n\\nHere's the process to apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 6:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (node 4) along with the path to that node (which is just [4] at this point).\\n2. Dequeue the first element from the queue. Check if it is the target node (node 6). If it is, we have found our shortest path.\\n3. If it's not the target node, for each of its adjacent nodes, enqueue them if they haven't been visited yet, along with the updated path that includes the current node.\\n4.

Node 0 is connected to node 4 (which is already included in the path) and node 3 (which is also already included in the path). There are no new nodes to enqueue.\\n- We dequeue node 3 next. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 0, but both have been visited already, so we don't enqueue them.\\n- Now we need to go back to the previous level of the queue. Since we've exhausted the neighbors of node 4, we don't have a path to node 6 yet.\\n- We continue this process. Node 1, which is connected to node 3, has already been visited. However, node 7 is a new node and is enqueued with path [4, 3, 1, 7].\\n- Dequeue node 7. It is not the target node, and its only unvisited neighbor is node 1, which we have already visited.\\n- Now we need to continue with node 5, which is connected to node 2 and has not been visited yet. We enqueue it with path [4, 0, 5].\\n- Dequeue node 5. It is not the target node, but it is connected to node 6, which is the target node and has not been visited yet. We enqueue node 6 with path [4, 0, 5, 6].\\n- Dequeue node 6.
