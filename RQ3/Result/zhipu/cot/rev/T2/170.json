Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (12), along with the path taken to reach it (which initially is just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the first element from the queue and examine its neighbors.\\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet, mark it as visited and enqueue it with the updated path.\\n4.
