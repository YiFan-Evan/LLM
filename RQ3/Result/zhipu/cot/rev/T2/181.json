BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (node 23).\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, keep a dictionary to store the parent of each node. This will help backtrack the path once the target is reached.\\n4. Dequeue a node from the queue and examine its neighbors.\\n5. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n6. If we reach the target node (node 19 in this case), we stop and backtrack using the parent pointers to find the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\nStarting at node 23, we will explore its neighbors (which are nodes 9, 10, 11, and 19 according to the edge list).
