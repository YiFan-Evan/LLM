BFS is suitable because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's the thought process using BFS:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, maintain a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node. This can be done by mapping each node to its predecessor.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n5. If this node is the destination, reconstruct the path from the start node to the destination by following the predecessors.\\n6.
