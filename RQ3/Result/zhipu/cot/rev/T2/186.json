Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node which is set to 0.\\n2. Initialize a priority queue (or a min-heap) and insert the start node with a distance of 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c.

We continue this process, always expanding the node with the smallest distance. When we reach node 22, we stop.\\n5.
