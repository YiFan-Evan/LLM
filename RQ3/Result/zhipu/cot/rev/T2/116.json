BFS is a good choice for this because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\\n\\nHere is the step-by-step process to apply BFS to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to explore, and a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node (to reconstruct the path later). Add the start node to the queue and mark it as visited by setting its parent to itself (or to None if you prefer).\\n\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and explore its neighbors.\\n\\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited by setting its parent to the current node, and add it to the queue.\\n\\n4. Once we have visited the destination node, we stop the search.\\n\\n5. To reconstruct the path, we backtrack from the destination node to the start node using the parent pointers.\\n\\nNow let's apply this process to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start node: 10\\n- Destination: 3\\n\\nWe initialize our queue and parent dictionary:\\n\\n```\\nqueue = [10]\\nparents = {0: None, 1: None, 2: None, 3: None, 4: None, 5: None, 6: None, 7: None, 8: None, 9: None, 10: None, 11: None, 12: None}\\nparents[10] = 10  # Mark the start node as visited by setting its parent to itself\\n```\\n\\nNow we begin BFS:\\n\\n- Dequeue 10 and explore its neighbors (8 and 12). Set their parents to 10 and enqueue them.\\n- Dequeue 12 and explore its neighbor (it has no other unvisited neighbors).\\n- Dequeue 8 and explore its neighbors (1, 2, 4, 6, 7).
