BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertex neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It's a suitable choice for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it guarantees that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's how we would apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 22 to node 5:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (22) along with the path to reach it (which initially is just [22]).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it. If it is the target node (5), we have found our shortest path.\\n3. If it is not the target node, enqueue all of its neighbors that have not been visited yet, along with the path to reach them.\\n4.
