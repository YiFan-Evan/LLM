This algorithm is a common choice for finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights. In this case, since the graph does not specify weights for the edges, I will assume that each edge has a weight of 1, which is typical when weights are not provided.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process for applying Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a distance dictionary with a distance of infinity for all nodes except the start node, which has a distance of 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a simple list in this case) to keep track of the nodes to visit, starting with the start node and its distance.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\\n   a. Pop the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through the current node. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\\n   c. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node by storing the previous node in a dictionary.\\n4. Once the target node has been dequeued from the priority queue, reconstruct the path by following the previous nodes from the target node back to the start node.\\n\\nNow, let's apply these steps to the given graph:\\n\\n1.
