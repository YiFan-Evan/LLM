This algorithm is a common choice for finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative edge weights, which is suitable since we don't have information about the weights and can assume they are non-negative for this problem.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process for applying Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a min-heap) to keep track of the nodes to explore, with the start node having the priority 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, extract the node with the smallest distance.\\n4. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance from the start node through the current node.\\n5. If this distance is shorter than the previously known distance, update the shortest distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue with the new priority.\\n6. Keep track of the path by storing the previous node for each node visited.\\n7. Once the destination node is reached, backtrack through the previous nodes to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n1.
