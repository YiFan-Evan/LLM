Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to explore and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node.\\n2. Enqueue the start node (3) and set the distance to it as 0.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node and examine its neighbors.\\n4. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited (or if a shorter path to it is found), update its shortest path and enqueue it.\\n5.
