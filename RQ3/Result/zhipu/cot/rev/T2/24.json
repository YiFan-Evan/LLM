BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the paths taken to reach each node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of this node, if it has not been visited yet, record the path to reach it by appending the current node to the path that led to the current node.\\n4. If we reach the target node, we can stop the search.\\n5. Once the search is complete, the shortest path to the target node will be recorded in the dictionary.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph, starting from node 4 and looking for the shortest path to node 0:\\n\\n- Start with node 4 in the queue. The path to node 4 is [4].\\n- Dequeue node 4 and enqueue its neighbors: 7 and 3. Update paths: path to 7 is [4, 7], path to 3 is [4, 3].\\n- Dequeue node 7. Since there are no more nodes that can be reached directly from 7 that lead closer to 0, we move on.\\n- Dequeue node 3. Enqueue its neighbors that lead closer to 0: 5 and 2. Update paths: path to 5 is [4, 3, 5], path to 2 is [4, 3, 2].\\n- Dequeue node 5. Enqueue its neighbor 6. Update path: path to 6 is [4, 3, 5, 6].\\n- Dequeue node 2. Since 0 is not directly connected to 2, we move on.\\n- Dequeue node 6. Enqueue its neighbors that lead to 0: 0 and 1. Update paths: path to 0 is [4, 3, 5, 6, 0], path to 1 is [4, 3, 5, 6, 1].\\n- Node 0 is in the queue now.
