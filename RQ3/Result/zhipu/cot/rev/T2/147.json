Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the provided graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 3, set its distance to 0 (since it's the starting point).\\n- The neighbors of node 3 are not directly connected to the destination node 13, so we have to move to the next closest node. Node 3 is connected to node 6, so we'll consider this path.\\n- From node 6, we can go to nodes 12 and 14, but neither of these is our destination. We'll have to continue.\\n- Node 6 is also connected to node 12, which is a step closer to our destination, as it is directly connected to node 13.\\n\\nAt this point, we can stop, as we have found the shortest path from node 3 to node 13, which is through node 6.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->6->13\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 11], [0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 8], [1, 9], [2, 9], [3, 6], [4, 10], [6, 12], [6, 14], [7, 9], [7, 12], [10, 13]]} The start node: 13 The destination: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from node 13 to node 3 in the given graph, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm.
