BFS is suitable because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process for applying BFS:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored, and a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node.\\n2. Enqueue the starting node and mark it as visited by adding it to the path dictionary with the path leading to it being just itself.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node to explore.\\n4. For each of its neighbors, if the neighbor has not been visited (not in the path dictionary), mark it as visited by adding it to the path dictionary with the current node as the previous node in the path.\\n5. Enqueue the neighbor.\\n6. Repeat the process until the target node is dequeued from the queue, at which point the shortest path has been found.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\nStarting node: 3\\nDestination: 9\\n\\n1. Enqueue 3 and mark it as visited with path {3: [3]}.\\n2. Dequeue 3 and explore its neighbors: 6 and 9.\\n3. Mark 6 as visited with path {6: [3, 6]} and enqueue it.\\n4. Mark 9 as visited with path {9: [3, 9]} and enqueue it.\\n5. Since 9 is the destination, we stop here.\\n\\nWe have found the shortest path from node 3 to node 9, which is just [3, 9].
