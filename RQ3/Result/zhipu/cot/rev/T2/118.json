To apply Dijkstra's algorithm, we'll follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Initialize a priority queue (or a simple min-heap) and insert the start node with the distance 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n    a.

There are no edges listed that include node 9 as a start or end point.

Node 3 is extracted next (distance 1). It is connected to nodes 11 and 7.\\n   - Node 11 can be reached at a distance of 2 (3->11), which is shorter than the current distance (inf), so update it.\\n   - Node 7's distance is already 0, so no update is needed.\\n3.

Node 6 is extracted next (distance 3).
