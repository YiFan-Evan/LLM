BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertex neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is done so via the shortest path from the starting node.\\n\\nLet's walk through the BFS process for the given graph with the start node being 3 and the destination being 22:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add the start node to the queue and mark it as visited.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and check if it is the destination. If it is, we have found our shortest path.\\n3. If it's not the destination, add all unvisited neighbors of the node to the queue and mark them as visited, keeping track of the node that got us to the neighbor (the parent).\\n4. Repeat until we find the destination or the queue is empty.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\nStarting at node 3:\\n- Node 3 is visited, and its neighbors (15 and 24) are added to the queue with 3 being their parent.\\n\\nVisiting node 15 (from node 3):\\n- Node 15 is visited, and its neighbors (5 and 9) are added to the queue with 15 being their parent.\\n\\nVisiting node 24 (from node 3):\\n- Node 24 is visited, and its neighbors (12 and 3) are added to the queue with 24 being their parent. Node 3 is already visited, so we don't add it again.\\n\\nContinuing with BFS, we would visit nodes 5, 9, and 12 next. However, we can skip ahead because we are looking for the shortest path to node 22.\\n\\nVisiting node 6 (from node 2):\\n- Node 6 is visited, and its neighbors (19, 22, and 2) are added to the queue with 6 being their parent.\\n\\nAt this point, we have reached node 22 from node 6. We can now backtrack to construct the path from node 3 to node 22 by following the parents:\\n\\nNode 22 was reached from node 6, node 6 was reached from node 2, and node 2 was reached from node 2 itself (since it's one of the starting nodes).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->15->6->22\\n\\nPlease note that the actual BFS process would involve maintaining a parent array or a dictionary to keep track of which node led us to each visited node, and the above explanation skips some steps for brevity.
