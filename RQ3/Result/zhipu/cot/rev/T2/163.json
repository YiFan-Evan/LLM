This algorithm is a common choice for finding the shortest path problem in a graph with non-negative edge weights.

This is better than the current distance to node 6, which is infinity, so we update the distance and add node 6 to the priority queue with a distance of 1. Node 1 is not directly connected to node 8, so we do not update its distance.\\n   b. Next, we explore node 6, which has neighbors 21 and 8. We do not update the distance to node 8 since we arrived at it by the shortest path already. We calculate the distance to node 21 through node 6, which is 2. This is better than the current distance to node 21, which is infinity, so we update the distance and add node 21 to the priority queue with a distance of 2.\\n   c.
