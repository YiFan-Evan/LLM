BFS is suitable for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node and examine its neighbors.\\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet, mark it as visited by setting its parent in the dictionary and enqueue it.\\n4.

I didn't continue correctly with the BFS from node 5. Node 5 has two neighbors: 10 and 8. Since we haven't visited node 8 yet from node 5, we should have continued with node 8. Let's correct this and continue the BFS:\\n\\n- Dequeue node 5, mark it as visited with parent 10, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors, which is only node 8.\\n- Dequeue node 8, mark it as visited with parent 5, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 9.\\n- Dequeue node 9, mark it as visited with parent 8, and since we reached the target node, we stop.\\n\\nNow we backtrack from node 10 to the start node using the parent pointers:\\n\\n- Node 10's parent is 5.\\n- Node 5's parent is 8.\\n- Node 8's parent is 7.\\n- Node 7's parent is 3.\\n- Node 3's parent is not relevant since we didn't come from node 6 to node 3 directly.\\n- We continue until we reach the start node 6.\\n\\nThe correct shortest path from node 6 to node 10 is actually through node 2, then node 11, then node 1, and finally node 5.
