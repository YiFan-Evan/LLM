We have not yet visited node 8 directly from any of the nodes we have visited. However, we notice that node 4 is connected to node 7, and node 7 is connected to node 4 and node 20. Node 20 is connected to node 4 and node 23. This means we can reach node 8 from node 20, as node 20 is connected to node 4, which is connected to node 7, and node 7 is connected to node 4, which leads to node 8.\\n\\nSo, we need to find the path to node 20 from node 12 and then continue to node 8. From the edges, we see that node 18 is connected to node 21 and node 20. Since we are looking for the shortest path, we should take the path through node 18 to node 20 and then to node 8.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 12->15->16->0->24->20->4->7->8\""}]
