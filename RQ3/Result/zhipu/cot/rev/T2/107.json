Initialize distances from the start node to all other nodes as infinite, and set the distance from the start node to itself as 0.\\n2. Set the initial node as the start node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited.\\n5. After visiting all nodes, the shortest path to each node will be known.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 9 with a distance of 0.\\n- Neighbors of 9 are 10 and 11. Update distances to 10 and 11 if the path through 9 is shorter.\\n- Move to the next unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance.

From node 9, the shortest path to node 0 is not direct. The neighbors of node 9 are node 10 and node 11.\\n2. From node 10, the shortest path to node 0 is through node 6 (edges [6, 10] and [0, 6]).\\n3.

From node 6, we have neighbors 10 with an edge [[6, 10]] and the start node 0, but since we've already visited node 0, we ignore it.\\n7. The distance to node 10 through node 6 is 1 (since there is a direct edge), so we update the distance to node 10 to 2 (1 from 0 to 6, plus 1 from 6 to 10).\\n8. Now, we need to choose the next node to visit. The unvisited nodes with their current tentative distances are: 6 (distance 1), 10 (distance 2). We choose node 6, as it has the smallest distance.\\n9.
