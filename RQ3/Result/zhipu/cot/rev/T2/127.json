Initialize a queue with the starting node (10) and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (parent dictionary).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the queue and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited (not in the parent dictionary), mark it as visited by adding it to the parent dictionary with the current node as its parent, and enqueue it.\\n4. Repeat this process until the target node (6) is dequeued from the queue, which indicates that we have found the shortest path.\\n5. Once the target node is found, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent dictionary to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the provided graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 10, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\\n- The neighbors of 10 are 11 and 14. Add these to the queue if they're not already visited.\\n- Next, we'll dequeue 11, and its neighbors are 10 (which is already visited) and 14 (which is already in the queue).\\n- Then we'll dequeue 14, which has neighbors 10 (visited), 8 (not visited, so we add it to the queue and mark it as visited by 14), and 13 (visited).\\n- Next, we'll dequeue 8, which has neighbor 10 (visited), and 2 (not visited, so we add it to the queue and mark it as visited by 8).\\n- Dequeue 2, and its neighbor 8 is visited, so we move on.\\n- Dequeue 13, and we'll explore its neighbors 0 and 5. Both are visited, so we continue.\\n- Dequeue 3, which is a neighbor of 0 and has not been visited, so we add it to the queue and mark it as visited by 0.\\n- Dequeue 9, a neighbor of 1, which has not been visited, so we add it to the queue and mark it as visited by 1.\\n- Dequeue 6, which is the target node. We stop here.\\n\\nNow we backtrack from node 6 to node 10 to find the shortest path:\\n\\n- Node 6's parent is node 1.\\n- Node 1's parent is node 9.\\n- Node 9's parent is node 7.\\n- However, we made a mistake here. Node 9 cannot have node 7 as its parent based on the given edges. Let's correct this and backtrack from node 6 again.\\n\\n- Node 6's parent is node 5.\\n- Node 5's parent is node 13.\\n- Node 13's parent is node 0.\\n- Node 0's parent is node 3.\\n- Node 3's parent is node 10, which is the start node.\\n\\nNow we can construct the shortest path from node 10 to node 6:\\n\\n10 -> 3 -> 0 -> 13 -> 5 -> 6\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->3->0->13->5->6\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 13], [0, 3], [1, 9], [1, 6], [2, 8], [3, 14], [4, 12], [4, 8], [5, 6], [5, 13], [7, 9], [8, 10], [10, 11], [10, 14]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from node 6 to node 10 in the given graph, we can again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
