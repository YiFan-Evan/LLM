graph, I will once again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is a good choice for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph like this one.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (4) to it.\\n2. Keep track of the paths taken to reach each node using a dictionary.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\\n4. For each unvisited neighbor, record the path taken to reach it by appending the current node to the path.\\n5. If the destination node is reached, the path to that node is the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply the BFS algorithm to the graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 4 in the queue. Its neighbors are 9.\\n- Move to node 9. Its neighbors are 1 and 11.\\n- Move to node 1. Its neighbors are 9 (which we've already visited) and there are no other neighbors that lead back to 0.\\n- Move back to node 11. Its neighbors are 2 and 8.\\n- Move to node 2. Its neighbors are 11 (which we've already visited) and 14.\\n- Move to node 14. Its neighbors are 2 (which we've already visited) and 6.\\n- Move to node 6. Its neighbor is 14 (which we've already visited), and there are no other neighbors that lead back to 0.\\n- Move back to node 8. Its neighbor is 7.\\n- Move to node 7. Its neighbor is 5.\\n- Move to node 5. Its neighbors are 0 and 7 (which we've already visited).\\n- Move to node 0. We've reached the destination.\\n\\nThe path taken to reach node 0 from node 4 is 4->9->1, and then directly to 0.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->9->1->0\""}]
