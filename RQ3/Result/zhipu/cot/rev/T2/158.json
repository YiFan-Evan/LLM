Since the edge weights are not provided, we'll assume each edge has a weight of 1 for simplicity.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step thought process:\\n\\n1. Initialize a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the nodes to be visited, with their current shortest distance from the start node. We start with the start node (node 9) with a distance of 0.\\n2. Also, initialize a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node, with the start node having an empty path.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Extract the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node (node 2), we have found the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes, calculate the distance through the current node and update the shortest distance if it's smaller than the previously recorded distance.\\n   d. Update the path to the adjacent node to reflect the shortest path found so far.\\n   e. Add the updated adjacent node to the priority queue.\\n4. Once we reach the target node, we backtrack through the path dictionary to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this process to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 9, distance = 0, path = [9].\\n- Node 9 is connected to node 10. Update: distance to node 10 = 1, path = [9, 10].\\n- Node 10 is connected to nodes 8 and 12. Node 8 is not in the priority queue yet, so add it with distance 2 and path [9, 10, 8]. Node 12 is already connected directly to node 7, so we skip it for now.\\n- Node 8 is connected to node 0. Update: distance to node 0 = 3, path = [9, 10, 8, 0].\\n- Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 7, and 8 (which we've already visited with a shorter path). Update: distance to node 1 = 4, path = [9, 10, 8, 0, 1].\\n- Node 1 is not connected to node 2, but node 7 is connected to node 2. However, we've already visited node 7 from node 2 in a shorter path, so we don't need to consider node 7 again.\\n- Now, we check node 2, which is our target. Since we've reached it, we stop the algorithm.\\n\\nBacktracking from node 2, we find that the shortest path is [2, 7, 0, 8, 10, 9].
