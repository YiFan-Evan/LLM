BFS is a good choice for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's the process for finding the shortest path from node 0 to node 2:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node (0), along with the path to reach it (which is just [0] at this point).\\n2. Dequeue the first element from the queue.
