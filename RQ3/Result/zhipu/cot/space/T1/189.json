Moving 40 steps counter-clockwise from the breakwater means we go back 40 - 7 = 33 steps from the confectionery store.\\n\\nSince there are 20 items on the path, we can find the item by taking 33 % 20, which is 13 (because 33 = 1*20 + 13). This means we go back 13 steps from the confectionery store to find the item.\\n\\nCounting 13 items from the confectionery store in a counter-clockwise direction, we pass the carton, the spindle, the tray, the water tower, the Boston Terrier, the duck, the breakwater, the fountain, the cardoon, the airship, the hare, and the fountain pen, which makes 12 items.
