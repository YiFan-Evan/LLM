Moving -20 steps (which is equivalent to 20 steps counter-clockwise) from the snail will bring you to the starting position of the snail again. However, since we moved 1 step clockwise initially, we need to account for that as well.\\n\\nSo, we subtract the initial clockwise step from the total:\\n-20 steps + 1 step (clockwise) = -19 steps\\n\\nNow, we need to find the item 19 steps counter-clockwise from the snail. Since the snail is the 19th item from the starting point (the marmoset), moving 19 steps counter-clockwise from the snail will bring us to the starting point, the marmoset.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: marmoset\""}]
