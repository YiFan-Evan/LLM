Then, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise:\\n- Moving 19 steps counter-clockwise from the hen-of-the-woods will circle around the path and end up on the dot after the baseball (since 19 steps counter-clockwise from the hen-of-the-woods is equivalent to 1 step clockwise from the baseball).\\n\\n3. Next, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise:\\n- Moving 13 steps counter-clockwise from the baseball will land on the dot after the rock crab.\\n\\n4.
