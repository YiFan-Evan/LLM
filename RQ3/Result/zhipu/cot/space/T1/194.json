Starting from the bow, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   Since the path is circular and has 20 dots, moving 15 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 5 steps clockwise (because 20 - 15 = 5).\\n\\n2. Then, moving 16 steps clockwise from the new position:\\n   This moves us further along the path from the bow.\\n\\n3. Next, moving 9 steps clockwise from the new position:\\n   This continues the movement along the path.\\n\\n4. Finally, moving 6 steps clockwise from the new position:\\n   This is the last movement to determine our final position.\\n\\nNow, let's add up all the clockwise movements and subtract the counter-clockwise movement:\\n\\n15 (counter-clockwise, which is equivalent to 5 clockwise) + 16 + 9 + 6 = 36 steps clockwise.\\n\\nNow we need to find out which item is located at the 36th step from the bow when moving clockwise. Since the path has 20 dots, we can use modulo arithmetic to find the position:\\n\\n36 % 20 = 16 (because 36 divided by 20 gives a remainder of 16).\\n\\nSo, we count 16 items clockwise from the bow.
