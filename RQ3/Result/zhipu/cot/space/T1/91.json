Starting from the ping-pong ball, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. Since there are 10 dots, moving 5 steps clockwise from the ping-pong ball will land you on the dot with the loupe.\\n\\n2. From the loupe, you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction. Starting from the loupe and moving 7 steps clockwise will land you on the dot with the crash helmet because the loupe is 8 steps away from the crash helmet in a clockwise direction, so one more step will get you to the crash helmet.\\n\\n3.
