Since the path is circular and has 10 dots, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise from the bakery would bring you to the dot before the bakery. Counting from the bakery, you would pass the dowitcher, the wing, the tray, the chiffonier, the snoek, and the barber chair, which is 6 steps. The 7th step would bring you to the high-speed train.
