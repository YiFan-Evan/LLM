Moving 3 steps clockwise from the gown will bring you to the orange.\\n2. Then, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the orange will bring you back to the cliff dwelling.\\n3. Finally, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the cliff dwelling will bring you to the computer mouse.\\n\\nSo the net movement is 3 steps clockwise, then 5 + 3 = 8 steps counter-clockwise, which results in a net movement of -5 steps (since we moved 8 steps back and only 3 steps forward).\\n\\nSince we started at the gown and moved 5 steps counter-clockwise, we will end up at the television (as the gown is between the cliff dwelling and the orange, and moving 5 steps back from the gown takes us past the cliff dwelling and the green mamba to the television).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: television\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
