Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the sundial:\\n   Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 3 from the current position (the position of the sundial). The sundial is the 5th item on the list, so moving 3 steps back would be 5 - 3 = 2. The 2nd item on the list is the bell-cot.\\n\\n2. Moving 15 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   We start from the bell-cot (which is the 2nd item). Moving 15 steps counter-clockwise would take us 15 - 2 = 13 steps back. Since there are 20 items on the path, we can calculate the new position by subtracting 13 from 20, which gives us 20 - 13 = 7. The 7th item on the list is the bald eagle.\\n\\n3. Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   We start from the bald eagle (which is the 7th item). Moving 14 steps counter-clockwise would take us 14 - 7 = 7 steps back. Since we've already moved to the 7th item, we subtract 7 from 7, which gives us 7 - 7 = 0. However, since we are on a circular path, we need to consider that moving back 7 steps from the 7th item would actually take us to the end of the list and wrap around to the beginning. So, we need to calculate the position by taking the modulus of 7 with the total number of items (20), which is 7 % 20 = 7. But since we've already counted the bald eagle as the 7th item, we need to go one step further to the 8th item, which is the jay.\\n\\n4. Moving 16 steps clockwise:\\n   We start from the jay (which is the 8th item). Moving 16 steps clockwise would take us 16 + 8 = 24 steps forward. Since there are only 20 items on the path, we need to use the modulus operation to find the final position. 24 % 20 = 4, which means we end up at the 4th item on the list.
