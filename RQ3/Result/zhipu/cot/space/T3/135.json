Starting from the Asian elephant, move around the ring by 15 steps clockwise. Since the path consists of 20 connected dots, this would take us to the item 15 steps ahead of the Asian elephant, landing on the catamaran.\\n\\n2. Then, move around the ring by 19 steps counter-clockwise. This would take us 19 steps back from the catamaran. Since we're moving counter-clockwise, we count backwards around the circle. This would bring us to the Miniature Schnauzer.\\n\\n3. Next, move around the ring by 7 steps clockwise from the Miniature Schnauzer. This would take us 7 steps forward from the Miniature Schnauzer, landing on the tabby cat.\\n\\n4. Finally, move around the ring by 15 steps clockwise from the tabby cat. This would take us 15 steps forward from the tabby cat. To find the final position, we add 15 to the current position. Since we're on a circular path, we can calculate the position by taking the total steps moved clockwise and subtracting the number of positions to get back to the starting point (20), then taking the remainder.\\n\\nThe total steps moved clockwise are 15 (from the Asian elephant to the catamaran) + 7 (from the Miniature Schnauzer to the tabby cat) + 15 (from the tabby cat forward) = 37 steps.\\n\\nNow, we find the position by taking the remainder of 37 divided by 20 (since there are 20 dots on the circle):\\n\\n37 % 20 = 17\\n\\nThis means we are 17 steps from the starting point, which is the Asian elephant.
