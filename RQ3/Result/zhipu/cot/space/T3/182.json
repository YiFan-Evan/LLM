From the Samoyed, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   - Since there are 20 dots, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise from the Samoyed would mean passing the starting point (Samoyed) and moving 14 more steps. This would land us on the trilobite (because 14 steps from the Samoyed in that direction would be 1 step past the triceratops).\\n\\n3. From the trilobite, moving 17 steps clockwise:\\n   - Moving 17 steps clockwise from the trilobite would take us past the kingsnake, Malinois, and all the way to the digital clock (because after the Malinois, the next item in the clockwise direction is the digital clock).\\n\\n4. From the digital clock, moving 5 steps clockwise:\\n   - 1 step: butcher shop\\n   - 2 steps: stretcher\\n   - 3 steps: passenger car\\n   - 4 steps: beer bottle\\n   - 5 steps: power drill\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: power drill\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
