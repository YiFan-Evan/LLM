Since the path is circular with 10 dots, moving 14 steps from the horizontal bar would mean you move 4 steps beyond the nematode (which is the last item on the list). Since 14 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 4, you would end up at the item in the 4th position, which is the pufferfish.\\n\\n2. Next, you move 18 steps counter-clockwise. From the pufferfish, moving 18 steps backward would take you past the station wagon and around the circle. Since 18 divided by 10 leaves a remainder of 8, you would end up 8 steps before the pufferfish. Counting backward from the pufferfish, this would place you at the screw.\\n\\n3.
