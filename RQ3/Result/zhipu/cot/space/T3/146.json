Starting from the oxygen mask, we move 8 steps clockwise. Since the path is circular and has 20 dots, we can think of each dot as a position number from 1 to 20. The oxygen mask is at position 2 (since the strainer is at position 1). Moving 8 steps from position 2 takes us to position 10 (2 + 8 = 10), where we find a wall clock.\\n\\n2. Next, we move 6 steps counter-clockwise. Moving 6 steps back from position 10 takes us to position 4 (10 - 6 = 4), where we find a small white.\\n\\n3. Then, we move 17 steps clockwise from position 4. Adding 17 to 4 gives us position 21, but since there are only 20 positions, we wrap around to position 1 (21 - 20 = 1), which is where we started, with the strainer.\\n\\n4. Finally, we move 7 steps counter-clockwise from position 1. Subtracting 7 from 1 gives us position -6, but since we can't have a negative position on a circular path, we add 20 to get position 14 (20 - 6 = 14), where we find a military uniform.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: military uniform.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
