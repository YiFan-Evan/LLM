Gossamer-winged butterfly\\n2. Goblet\\n3. Volcano\\n4. Tiger\\n5. Weasel\\n\\nWe start from the tiger and move 8 steps counter-clockwise. Since the path is circular, we will circle back around. Starting from the tiger and moving 8 steps counter-clockwise takes us past the volcano, the goblet, and the gossamer-winged butterfly, and we continue to pass the weasel and the tiger again. This means we have completed one full circle and are back at the tiger, and we continue to move past the gossamer-winged butterfly, the goblet, and the volcano once more.

We pass the gossamer-winged butterfly, the goblet, and the volcano, which brings us to the tiger again.\\n\\nHowever, since we are asked to move 6 steps from the weasel and we've already moved 8 steps from the tiger to reach the weasel, we need to consider the total number of steps moved. We have moved 8 + 6 = 14 steps in total. Since there are 5 items on the path, moving 14 steps is the same as moving 14 % 5 = 4 steps (because we would have completed one full circle and then moved 4 more steps).\\n\\nFrom the tiger, 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction take us past the volcano, the goblet, and the gossamer-winged butterfly, to the weasel.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Weasel\""}]
