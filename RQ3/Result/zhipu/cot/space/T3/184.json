Starting from the ski mask, moving 26 steps clockwise:\\n   Since there are 20 dots, moving 26 steps is equivalent to moving 6 steps after completing one full circle (26 % 20 = 6).\\n   This will land on the fire salamander.\\n\\n2. From the fire salamander, moving 20 steps clockwise:\\n   This is equivalent to one full circle, so we land back on the fire salamander.\\n\\n3. From the fire salamander, moving 10 steps clockwise:\\n   This will land on the bee.\\n\\n4. From the bee, moving 26 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   Moving 26 steps backward is equivalent to moving 14 steps forward in a clockwise direction after completing one full circle in the opposite direction (26 % 20 = 6, and 20 - 6 = 14).\\n   This will land on the isopod.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: isopod.\""}]
