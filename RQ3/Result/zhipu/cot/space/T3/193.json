So we can divide the net steps by the number of dots on the path:\\n\\n40 steps net clockwise / 20 dots = 2 full rotations (which would bring you back to the starting point) plus 0 steps (since 40 is exactly divisible by 20).\\n\\nTherefore, after the movements described, you end up right back at the hartebeest.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: hartebeest.\""}]
