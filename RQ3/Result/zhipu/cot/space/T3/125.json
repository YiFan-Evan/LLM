To find the equivalent position within one full cycle, we can use the modulo operation:\\n\\nNet movement (within one cycle) = -32 % 20\\nNet movement (within one cycle) = -12 steps counter-clockwise (since -32 + 20 twice = 8, and we need to subtract 12 more to stay within one cycle)\\n\\nNow, starting from the house finch and moving 12 steps counter-clockwise, we count the items in reverse order:\\n\\n1. house finch\\n2. koala\\n3. waste container\\n4.
