We moved 12 steps clockwise, then 16 steps counter-clockwise, and finally 12 steps counter-clockwise. The net movement is:\\n\\n12 (clockwise) - 16 (counter-clockwise) - 12 (counter-clockwise) = -16 steps\\n\\nSince the path is circular and has 10 dots, moving 16 steps counter-clockwise from the starting point (the ear) would bring us to the same position as moving 4 steps clockwise (because 10 dots - 16 steps = -6 steps, and -6 steps in a clockwise direction from the ear is the same as 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, which lands on the same dot).\\n\\nStarting from the ear and moving 4 steps clockwise:\\n- Ear (start)\\n- Mantis\\n- Pomegranate\\n- Threshing machine\\n\\nAfter 4 steps clockwise, I will be at the threshing machine.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: threshing machine\""}]
