Starting from the orangutan, moving 18 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   - Since the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 18 steps counter-clockwise from the orangutan would bring you to the dot before the longhorn beetle (because you would pass the longhorn beetle and then go back 2 more steps).\\n\\n2. Then, moving 2 steps clockwise:\\n   - From the dot before the longhorn beetle, moving 2 steps clockwise would bring you directly to the longhorn beetle.\\n\\n3. Next, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise from the longhorn beetle:\\n   - Moving 13 steps counter-clockwise from the longhorn beetle would bring you to the dot before the wok (since you would pass the wok and then go back 1 more step).\\n\\n4.
