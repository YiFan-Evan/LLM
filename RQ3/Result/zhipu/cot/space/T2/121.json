Since the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 13 steps from snoek will land you on the item after the Chihuahua (because snoek is between the wallaby and the Chihuahua). So, 13 steps from snoek would be 1 step past the Chihuahua, which is the lionfish.\\n\\n2. Then you move 3 steps clockwise from the lionfish. This would land you on the item after the lionfish, which is the peacock.\\n\\n3. You move another 3 steps clockwise from the peacock. This would land you on the item after the peacock, which is the Schipperke.\\n\\n4. Finally, you move 12 steps counter-clockwise from the Schipperke.
