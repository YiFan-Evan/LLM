Move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\\n\\nFirst, we'll convert the counter-clockwise movements into their clockwise equivalents since moving clockwise 20 steps is the same as moving counter-clockwise 0 steps (one full loop around the circle). So, moving 17 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 3 steps clockwise (20 - 17 = 3), and moving 5 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 15 steps clockwise (20 - 5 = 15).\\n\\nNow, let's add up all the movements in terms of clockwise steps:\\n\\n11 (clockwise) + 3 (clockwise equivalent of 17 counter-clockwise) + 4 (clockwise) + 15 (clockwise equivalent of 5 counter-clockwise) = 33 steps clockwise.\\n\\nSince there are 20 dots on the path, moving 33 steps clockwise is the same as moving 13 steps (33 % 20 = 13) because we are effectively making 1 full loop and then an additional 13 steps.\\n\\nStarting from the minibus (which is not listed as an item but as a starting point), we count 13 items clockwise:\\n\\n- Minibus (start, not an item)\\n- School bus\\n- Schipperke\\n- Milk can\\n- China cabinet\\n- Bulletproof vest\\n- Pineapple\\n- Balloon\\n- Limpkin\\n- Sock\\n- Schooner\\n- Siamang\\n- Unicycle\\n\\nThe 13th item from the minibus is the unicycle.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: unicycle\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
