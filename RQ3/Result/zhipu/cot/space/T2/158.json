Starting from the gas pump, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   - Since there are 20 dots, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise would be 1 step short of a full circle. This means I would end up one dot before the starting point, which is at the dot with the Italian Greyhound.\\n\\n2. From the Italian Greyhound, moving 15 steps clockwise:\\n   - Starting from the Italian Greyhound and moving 15 steps clockwise would bring me to the dot with the comic book.\\n\\n3.
