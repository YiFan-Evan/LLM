Since there are 20 items on the path, we can calculate the position after these steps by adding 14 to the position of the photocopier. However, we must consider that the path is circular, so if we move past the last item, we wrap around to the beginning.\\n\\nThe photocopier is the 15th item on the list. Moving 14 steps from the 15th item, we would be at the 29th position, but since there are only 20 items, we subtract 20 from 29 to wrap around, which gives us 9. So after 14 steps, we are at the 9th position, which is the ballpoint pen.\\n\\nNext, we move 6 more steps in a clockwise direction from the ballpoint pen. The ballpoint pen is the 9th item, so we add 6 to 9, which gives us 15.
