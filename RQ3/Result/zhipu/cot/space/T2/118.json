Moving 3 additional steps from the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, we pass the fiddler crab and the cheeseburger, and end up at the chime.\\n\\nAdding these steps together: 5 + 7 + 3 = 15 steps in total.\\n\\nSince there are 10 dots on the circular path, we can simplify the total steps to find the final position. Moving 15 steps in a clockwise direction is the same as moving 15 % 10 = 5 steps (because 15 is 1 full loop around the circle plus 5 additional steps).\\n\\nSo, starting from the fountain pen and moving 5 steps in a clockwise direction, we pass the loupe and arrive at the confectionery store, then the fountain, the hummingbird, and finally land on the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, and then the fiddler crab. After the fiddler crab, we find the cheeseburger.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: cheeseburger.\""}]
