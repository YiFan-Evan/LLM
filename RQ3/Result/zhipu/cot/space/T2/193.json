This will bring you to the Siberian Husky.\\n\\n2. Then, you move 16 steps counter-clockwise. Since you moved 3 steps clockwise initially, you need to move 16 + 3 = 19 steps to return to the starting point. However, moving 19 steps counter-clockwise from the hartebeest will not bring you back to the hartebeest because 19 is not a multiple of 20. Instead, you will end up 1 step before the hartebeest, which is at the hot pot.\\n\\n3. Finally, you move 7 steps counter-clockwise from the hot pot.
