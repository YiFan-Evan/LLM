Starting from the knee pad, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   - 1 step back: English Springer Spaniel\\n   - 2 steps back: Samoyed\\n\\n2. Then, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise from the Samoyed:\\n   - Since the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise from the Samoyed (which is at the top) would take us to the item that is 14 steps before the Samoyed. However, since the path is circular, we need to subtract 14 from 20 to find out how many steps forward (in the clockwise direction) we would end up at the same point. So, 20 - 14 = 6 steps forward (clockwise) from the Samoyed, which is the Malinois.\\n\\n3. Next, moving 17 steps clockwise from the Malinois:\\n   - We start at the Malinois and move 17 steps clockwise. Since the path has 20 dots, we would complete the circle once (which is 20 steps) and then have 17 - 20 = -3 steps left, which means we would move 3 steps back (counter-clockwise) from the Malinois. This would take us to the trilobite.\\n\\n4. Finally, moving 5 steps clockwise from the trilobite:\\n   - From the trilobite, moving 5 steps clockwise would take us to the kingsnake.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: kingsnake\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
