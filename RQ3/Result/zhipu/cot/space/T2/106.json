Starting at the chambered nautilus, moving 1 step counter-clockwise, you would land on the Basenji.\\n2. From the Basenji, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise would take you around the circle and back to the Basenji because 8 steps counter-clockwise from any point on a 10-dot circle brings you back to the same point (8 is 2 less than 10, so you would pass the starting point and end up 2 steps beyond it, which is the same as 2 steps clockwise from the starting point, and since we're moving counter-clockwise, it's the same as 8 steps counter-clockwise).\\n3.
