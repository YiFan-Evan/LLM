Starting from the lion, moving 17 steps counter-clockwise:\\nSince the path is circular with 20 dots, moving 17 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 3 steps clockwise (because 20 - 17 = 3). The lion is 5 steps away from the top of the path (the starting point with the Chow Chow). Moving 3 steps clockwise from the lion would take us past the scoreboard and the analog clock, landing on the barometer.\\n\\n2. Next, moving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the barometer:\\nMoving 8 steps counter-clockwise from the barometer would take us past the alligator lizard, the ping-pong ball, the high-speed train, the thimble, the cuirass, and then 3 more steps.
