Starting from the prairie grouse, move around the ring by 16 steps in a clockwise direction. Since there are 20 items on the circular path, moving 16 steps clockwise from the prairie grouse, we will land on the item that is 16 positions ahead. Counting from the prairie grouse, the 16th item is the prayer rug.\\n\\n2. Next, move around the ring by 17 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 17 from our current position. Counting back 17 items from the prayer rug, we will land on the bookstore.\\n\\n3. Then, move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Starting from the bookstore, counting back 5 items, we will land on the Australian Silky Terrier.\\n\\n4.
