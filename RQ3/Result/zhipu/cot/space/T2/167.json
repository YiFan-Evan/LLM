Starting at the whistle, moving 3 steps clockwise:\\n- After 1 step: Australian Kelpie\\n- After 2 steps: quilt\\n- After 3 steps: Irish Terrier\\n\\n2. From the Irish Terrier, moving 13 steps clockwise:\\n- After 13 steps, since there are 20 dots total, we would have completed one full loop (20 dots) and then moved an additional 13 - 20 = -7 steps, which means we would move 7 steps backward (counterclockwise) from the Irish Terrier.\\n- After 1 step counterclockwise: school bus\\n- After 2 steps counterclockwise: bobsleigh\\n- After 3 steps counterclockwise: orange\\n- After 4 steps counterclockwise: football helmet\\n- After 5 steps counterclockwise: ruffed grouse\\n- After 6 steps counterclockwise: flamingo\\n- After 7 steps counterclockwise: mongoose\\n\\n3. From the mongoose, moving 20 steps clockwise:\\n- Since there are 20 dots, moving 20 steps clockwise would bring us back to the starting point, which is the mongoose.\\n\\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the sequence of movements because after the first movement from the whistle to the Irish Terrier, the second movement should take us to the mongoose, not the second movement's calculation which brought us back to the mongoose.
