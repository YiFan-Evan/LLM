Since the path is circular and has 20 dots, we can use modular arithmetic to determine our position after each step.

Since there are 20 dots, we can calculate the position by taking the total steps moved modulo 20 (37 % 20), which gives us the remainder when 37 is divided by 20.\\n\\n37 % 20 = 17\\n\\nThis means we land on the 17th item after the Cairn Terrier when moving clockwise.
