Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products, and it is based on the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u = x^2 and dv = e^x dx. Then, we need to find du and v. Taking the derivative of u with respect to x gives us du = 2x dx, and integrating dv gives us v = e^x.\\n\\nApplying the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222be^x * x^2 dx = x^2 * e^x - \u222be^x * 2x dx\\n\\nNow, we need to apply integration by parts again to the remaining integral \u222be^x * 2x dx. Let's use u = 2x and dv = e^x dx again. Then, du = 2 dx and v = e^x.\\n\\nApplying integration by parts again:\\n\\n\u222be^x * 2x dx = 2x * e^x - \u222b2 * e^x dx\\n                 = 2x * e^x - 2 * e^x\\n\\nNow, we can substitute this result back into our original integration by parts expression:\\n\\n\u222be^x * x^2 dx = x^2 * e^x - (2x * e^x - 2 * e^x)\\n                 = x^2 * e^x - 2x * e^x + 2 * e^x\\n                 = e^x * (x^2 - 2x + 2)\\n\\nNow we have the indefinite integral of the function. To find the value of the integral when x = 4, we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\\n\\ne^4 * (4^2 - 2*4 + 2)\\n= e^4 * (16 - 8 + 2)\\n= e^4 * (10)\\n\\nNow, to get the integer result by rounding down, we would calculate e^4 * 10 and round down to the nearest integer.
