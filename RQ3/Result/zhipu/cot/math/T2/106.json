The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u = ln(1+x) and dv = dx. Then, we need to find du and v.\\n\\nu = ln(1+x)\\ndu = 1/(1+x) dx (this is the derivative of u with respect to x)\\n\\nFor dv = dx, v is simply the antiderivative of dx, which is x.\\n\\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bln(1+x) dx = x*ln(1+x) - \u222bx/(1+x) dx\\n\\nNow, we need to integrate \u222bx/(1+x) dx. To do this, we can simplify the integrand by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by x (assuming x is not zero):\\n\\n\u222bx/(1+x) dx = \u222b1/(1/x+1) dx\\n\\nNow, let's perform a substitution to make the integral easier. Let u = 1/x + 1, then du = -1/x^2 dx. To balance the equation, we multiply dx by -x^2, which gives us -x dx = du. Now we have:\\n\\n\u222b1/(1/x+1) dx = \u222b-x/(1/x+1) dx = -\u222b1/u du\\n\\nThe integral of 1/u with respect to u is ln|u| + C.
