Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products, and it is based on the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u = ln(x) and dv = e^(-x) dx (since e^x dx is the derivative of e^x, we use e^(-x) dx to make the integration by parts work out nicely).\\n\\nNow we need to find du and v:\\n\\ndu = (1/x) dx (since the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x)\\nv = \u222be^(-x) dx = -e^(-x) (since the antiderivative of e^(-x) is -e^(-x))\\n\\nApplying the integration by parts formula, we get:\\n\\n\u222bln(x)/e^x dx = ln(x)(-e^(-x)) - \u222b(-e^(-x))(1/x) dx\\n\u222bln(x)/e^x dx = -ln(x)/e^x + \u222be^(-x)/x dx\\n\\nThe integral \u222be^(-x)/x dx does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, but for the purpose of this problem, we can leave it as is because we're going to evaluate the integral at a specific point (x=4) rather than finding a general expression for the indefinite integral.

So we focus on the first term:\\n\\n-ln(4)/e^4\\n\\nTo get the integer result of the expression by rounding down, we need to evaluate this expression and round down to the nearest integer.
