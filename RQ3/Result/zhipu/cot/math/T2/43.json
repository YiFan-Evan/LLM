Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions and is based on the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe can choose e^x as u and cos(x) dx as dv. Then, we need to find du and v.\\n\\nLet's proceed:\\n\\nu = e^x\\ndu = e^x dx\\n\\ndv = cos(x) dx\\nv = \u222bcos(x) dx = sin(x)\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222be^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) - \u222bsin(x) * e^x dx\\n\\nWe need to integrate sin(x) * e^x again. We can use integration by parts once more, with the same u and v as before, or we can recognize that the integral of sin(x) * e^x is a known integral that will result in the same expression with the opposite trigonometric function (cosine instead of sine), plus a constant. So let's integrate sin(x) * e^x:\\n\\n\u222bsin(x) * e^x dx = -e^x * cos(x) + \u222bcos(x) * e^x dx\\n\\nNow we substitute this back into our original equation:\\n\\n\u222be^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) - (-e^x * cos(x) + \u222bcos(x) * e^x dx)\\n\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\n\u222be^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) + e^x * cos(x) - \u222be^x * cos(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we have the integral on both sides of the equation. Let's add \u222be^x * cos(x) dx to both sides to isolate it on one side:\\n\\n2 * \u222be^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) + e^x * cos(x)\\n\\nDivide by 2:\\n\\n\u222be^x * cos(x) dx = (e^x * sin(x) + e^x * cos(x)) / 2\\n\\nThis is the indefinite integral of e^x * cos(x). Now we need to substitute x = 4 into this expression:\\n\\n(e^4 * sin(4) + e^4 * cos(4)) / 2\\n\\nCalculating this expression gives us a decimal number. To find the integer result by rounding down, we take the floor of this decimal number.\\n\\nAfter performing the calculations (which typically require a calculator because e^4 and trigonometric functions are not simple to compute by hand), we would round down to the nearest integer.
