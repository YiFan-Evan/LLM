Integration by parts is based on the product rule for differentiation and is given by:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nFirst, we need to choose u and dv. A common strategy is to choose u as the function that becomes simpler when differentiated and dv as the function that becomes simpler when integrated. In this case, we can let u = sinh(x) and dv = cos(x) dx.\\n\\nDifferentiating u gives us du = cosh(x) dx, and integrating dv gives us v = sin(x).\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) - \u222bsin(x)cosh(x) dx\\n\\nWe have a new integral on the right-hand side, but this time, the product of sinh(x) and cos(x) is in the opposite order. We can apply integration by parts again, but this time with u = cosh(x) and dv = sin(x) dx. Differentiating u gives us du = sinh(x) dx, and integrating dv gives us v = -cos(x).\\n\\nApplying integration by parts again:\\n\\n\u222bsin(x)cosh(x) dx = -cos(x)cosh(x) - \u222b(-cos(x))sinh(x) dx\\n\u222bsin(x)cosh(x) dx = -cos(x)cosh(x) + \u222bcos(x)sinh(x) dx\\n\\nNow we substitute this result back into our original integration by parts equation:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) - (-cos(x)cosh(x) + \u222bcos(x)sinh(x) dx)\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x) - \u222bcos(x)sinh(x) dx\\n\\nNotice that the last term on the right-hand side is the same as the original integral. This suggests that we have an equation where the integral on both sides cancels out, leaving us with:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x) + C\\n\\nHowever, this is not correct because we actually have an equation that includes the integral on both sides:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx + \u222bcos(x)sinh(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x) + C\\n\\nSince both integrals on the left-hand side are the same, we can combine them:\\n\\n2\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x) + C\\n\\nNow we solve for the integral:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = 1/2 * (sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x)) + C/2\\n\\nWe can simplify this by noting that sinh(x)cosh(x) = 1/2 * sinh(2x), which is a trigonometric identity for hyperbolic functions:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = 1/2 * (sinh(x)sin(x) + 1/2 * sinh(2x)) + C/2\\n\\nNow, let's substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx at x = 4 = 1/2 * (sinh(4)sin(4) + 1/2 * sinh(8)) + C/2\\n\\nSince we are not given the constant C and it will cancel out when we subtract it from the integral, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer result. Now, we need to evaluate sinh(4)sin(4) + 1/2 * sinh(8) without a calculator, which is not feasible by hand. However, we are interested in the integer part of the result after rounding down.\\n\\nsinh(4) and sinh(8) are hyperbolic sine functions, and their values grow exponentially as the argument increases. sin(4) is the sine of an angle in radians and does not grow exponentially. Even without exact values, we know that the sum of these functions will be a positive number. Since we are rounding down to the nearest integer, we need to determine if the sum is greater than or equal to 1.\\n\\nGiven that sinh(4)sin(4) is a product of two trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, which are both positive in the first quadrant, and considering that sinh(8) is significantly larger than sinh(4) due to the exponential growth of the hyperbolic sine function, the sum will be greater than 1. Therefore, when we round down to the nearest integer, the result will be at least 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sinh(x)*cos(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function 5 * (sinh(x) * cos(x)), we'll use the same strategy as before, but now we'll have an additional constant factor of 5 that we can integrate separately.\\n\\nFirst, we'll integrate the function sinh(x) * cos(x) using integration by parts, and then we'll multiply the result by 5.\\n\\nLet u = sinh(x) and dv = cos(x) dx. Then, du = cosh(x) dx and v = sin(x).\\n\\nUsing integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) - \u222bsin(x)cosh(x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate \u222bsin(x)cosh(x) dx. We'll apply integration by parts again with u = cosh(x) and dv = sin(x) dx. Then, du = sinh(x) dx and v = -cos(x).\\n\\n\u222bsin(x)cosh(x) dx = -cos(x)cosh(x) - \u222b(-cos(x))sinh(x) dx\\n\u222bsin(x)cosh(x) dx = -cos(x)cosh(x) + \u222bcos(x)sinh(x) dx\\n\\nNow substitute this back into our original equation:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) - (-cos(x)cosh(x) + \u222bcos(x)sinh(x) dx)\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x) - \u222bcos(x)sinh(x) dx\\n\\nWe now have the same integral on both sides, which means we can't solve it directly. However, we can simplify the expression by recognizing that \u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx is equal to \u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx, and we can combine them:\\n\\n2\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x)\\n\\nDivide both sides by 2 to solve for the integral:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = 1/2 * (sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x)) + C\\n\\nNow, we'll multiply this result by 5:\\n\\n\u222b5 * (sinh(x)cos(x)) dx = 5/2 * (sinh(x)sin(x) + cos(x)cosh(x)) + 5C\\n\\nSince we are not given the constant C and it will cancel out when we evaluate the expression at a specific value of x, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer result. Now let's substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n\u222b5 * (sinh(x)cos(x)) dx at x = 4 = 5/2 * (sinh(4)sin(4) + cos(4)cosh(4))\\n\\nNow we evaluate this expression. sinh(4)sin(4) and cos(4)cosh(4) are both positive numbers because both sinh(x) and cos(x) are positive in the first and second quadrants for x = 4 (since 4 radians is in the second quadrant). The product sinh(4)sin(4) will be smaller than cos(4)cosh(4) because cosh(x) grows much faster than sin(x) as x increases.\\n\\nSince we are rounding down to the nearest integer, we need to determine if the sum is greater than or equal to 1. Given the rapid growth of the hyperbolic functions, the sum will be significantly larger than 1. Therefore, when we round down to the nearest integer, the result will be greater than or equal to 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3 (since it's the integer part of the result after rounding down).\""}]
