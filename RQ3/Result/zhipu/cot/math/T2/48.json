The first part is a basic exponential function, and the second part is the product of x and a function of e^x.\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of 1/e^x is -e^(-x) because the derivative of -e^(-x) with respect to x is e^(-x), which is the original function 1/e^x.\\n\\nFor the second part, x/e^x, we can integrate it by parts.
