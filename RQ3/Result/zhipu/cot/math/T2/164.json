Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe'll choose u = ln(x) and dv = x dx. Then, we need to find du and v. The derivative of ln(x) with respect to x is 1/x, so du = 1/x dx.

The natural logarithm of 4, ln(4), is approximately 1.38629436112. Multiplying by 8 gives us approximately 11.0683548896.
