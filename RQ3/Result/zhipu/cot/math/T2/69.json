Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions, and it is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nFirst, we need to choose u and dv. Let's set:\\n\\nu = ln(x) then du = 1/x dx\\ndv = 1/sin(x) dx then v = -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)| (since \u222bcsc(x) dx = -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|)\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bln(x)/sin(x) dx = ln(x)(-ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|) - \u222b(-ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|)(1/x) dx\\n\\nHowever, integrating the second term again involves an integral of the form \u222bln(x)/sin(x) dx, which would result in an infinite recursion. This means we need to approach this problem differently, as integration by parts is not straightforward for this function.\\n\\nOne way to integrate this function is by using a substitution. However, there is no simple substitution that will yield a straightforward integral for ln(x)/sin(x). This integral does not have a closed-form solution in terms of elementary functions. It is one of those integrals that can only be expressed in terms of special functions or numerical approximations.\\n\\nSince we cannot find an exact indefinite integral using elementary functions, we cannot proceed with the substitution x = 4 to find the integer result as instructed. This problem cannot be solved with the given constraints and standard mathematical tools. Therefore, we cannot provide a final answer in the form of a single integer number as requested. \\n\\nIf this is a hypothetical scenario or an error in the problem statement, we would need to use numerical methods to approximate the integral, which would not satisfy the requirement of providing an exact integer answer.
