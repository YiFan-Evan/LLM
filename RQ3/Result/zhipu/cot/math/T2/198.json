Integration by parts is based on the product rule for differentiation, and it allows us to integrate the product of two functions.\\n\\nLet's denote u = ln(cos(x)) and dv = e^x dx. Then, we need to find du and v:\\n\\ndu/dx = -tan(x) (since the derivative of ln(cos(x)) is -tan(x) because d/dx[cos(x)] = -sin(x) and d/dx[ln(u)] = 1/u * du/dx)\\ndu = -tan(x) dx\\n\\nv = \u222b e^x dx = e^x (since the integral of e^x is e^x)\\n\\nNow, applying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222b ln(cos(x)) * e^x dx = uv - \u222b v * du\\n= e^x * ln(cos(x)) - \u222b e^x * (-tan(x)) dx\\n= e^x * ln(cos(x)) + \u222b e^x * tan(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral \u222b e^x * tan(x) dx is not straightforward and cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, we can use the fact that the derivative of e^x * cos(x) is e^x * cos(x) - e^x * sin(x), which is similar to e^x * tan(x) because tan(x) = sin(x)/cos(x). We can integrate e^x * cos(x) and then differentiate to find an equivalent integral for e^x * tan(x).\\n\\nLet's integrate e^x * cos(x) first:\\n\\n\u222b e^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * cos(x) - \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx\\n\\nNow, differentiate both sides with respect to x:\\n\\nd/dx [e^x * cos(x)] = e^x * cos(x) - e^x * sin(x) + e^x * sin(x)\\nd/dx [e^x * cos(x)] = e^x * cos(x)\\n\\nWe see that the derivative of e^x * cos(x) is similar to the original integrand but without the sin(x) term. To get the tan(x) term, we can divide by cos(x), but we must remember to include the absolute value because tan(x) can be negative:\\n\\nd/dx [e^x * cos(x)] / cos(x) = e^x * tan(x)\\n\\nNow we can integrate both sides with respect to x:\\n\\n\u222b e^x * tan(x) dx = e^x * cos(x) + C\\n\\nWe can now substitute this result back into our original integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b ln(cos(x)) * e^x dx = e^x * ln(cos(x)) + e^x * cos(x) + C\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this expression at x=4:\\n\\ne^4 * ln(cos(4)) + e^4 * cos(4) + C\\n\\nSince we are not given the value of the constant C and it will be the same for all x, it will not affect the result when we round down to an integer.
