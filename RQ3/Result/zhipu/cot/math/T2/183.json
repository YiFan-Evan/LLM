Let's consider u = e^x. Then, du/dx = e^x, which implies dx = du/e^x. Since u = e^x, we can rewrite dx as du/u.\\n\\nNow the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b cos(e^x) * sin(e^x) dx = \u222b cos(u) * sin(u) (du/u)\\n\\nSince we have a product of trigonometric functions, we can use the identity sin(2\u03b8) = 2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) to simplify the integrand. However, in this case, we don't have a 2 in front, so we'll have to work with the functions as they are. There is no straightforward substitution that simplifies this integral directly, so we'll use integration by parts.\\n\\nLet's set:\\nu = sin(u) and dv = cos(u) du\\n\\nThen:\\ndu = cos(u) du and v = sin(u)\\n\\nUsing integration by parts formula:\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nWe get:\\n\u222b cos(u) * sin(u) du = sin(u) * sin(u) - \u222b sin(u) * cos(u) du\\n\\nThis looks like the original integral, indicating that we are not making progress with this approach. Instead, we can recognize that the derivative of sin^2(u) is 2sin(u)cos(u), which suggests another substitution. Let's set v = sin^2(u) then dv = 2sin(u)cos(u) du. Our integral now is:\\n\\n1/2 \u222b 2sin(u)cos(u) du = 1/2 \u222b dv\\n\\nIntegrating dv gives us:\\n\\n1/2 v + C = 1/2 sin^2(u) + C\\n\\nNow, we replace u with e^x:\\n\\n1/2 sin^2(e^x) + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into our result:\\n\\n1/2 sin^2(e^4) + C\\n\\nTo find the integer result by rounding down, we need to calculate the value of sin^2(e^4) and then take half of it.

We can follow a similar process as before to integrate this function. First, let's recognize that the product of cos(e^x) and sin(e^x) can be written using the double angle identity for sine, sin(2\u03b8) = 2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8), but we need to adjust for the single angle here.\\n\\nLet's use the substitution u = e^x, so du = e^x dx, which implies dx = du/u. Now, let's rewrite the integral with this substitution:\\n\\n\u222b 5 * (cos(e^x) * sin(e^x)) dx = 5 \u222b (cos(u) * sin(u)) (du/u)\\n\\nNow we can use the double angle identity sin(2\u03b8) = 2sin(\u03b8)cos(\u03b8) and since we don't have a factor of 2, we can't directly apply this identity. Instead, we can try integration by parts or look for another substitution.
