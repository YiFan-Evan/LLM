The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe can let u = ln(x) and dv = 1/x dx. Then, we need to find du and v. \\n\\ndu/dx of ln(x) is 1/x, so du = 1/x dx.\\nTo find v, we integrate dv = 1/x dx, which gives us v = ln(x) (since the integral of 1/x is ln|x|, and because we're dealing with positive x, we can drop the absolute value).\\n\\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) * (1/x) dx = ln(x) * ln(x) - \u222b ln(x) * (1/x) dx\\n\\nHowever, we notice that the integral we're trying to solve appears on both sides of the equation.
