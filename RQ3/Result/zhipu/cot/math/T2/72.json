This is not a standard basic integral, so we'll use integration by parts or recognize it as a special function integral.\\n\\nLet's use integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe can set u = e^x and dv = (1/x)dx.

However, for the sake of this problem, we can integrate by parts again or recognize a pattern.\\n\\nLet's integrate by parts again for the second integral, setting u = ln|x| and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = (1/x)dx and v = e^x.\\n\\n\u222bln|x| * e^x dx = ln|x| * e^x - \u222be^x * (1/x) dx\\n\\nWe see that we end up with the same integral on the right-hand side of the equation, which suggests that this is an integral that does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. However, we can express it in terms of the exponential integral function Ei(x), which is defined as:\\n\\nEi(x) = \u222b(e^t/t) dt from t=1 to t=x\\n\\nThus, the integral of e^x * (1/x) can be expressed as Ei(x).\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into Ei(x):\\n\\nEi(4) = \u222b(e^t/t) dt from t=1 to t=4\\n\\nUnfortunately, the exponential integral function cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions and must be evaluated numerically.
