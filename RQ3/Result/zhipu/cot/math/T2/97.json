Integration by parts is based on the product rule for derivatives and the fundamental theorem of calculus. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe'll let u = sin(x) and dv = sinh(x) dx.

This integral can also be solved by parts, but notice that cos(x)cosh(x) is the derivative of sin(x)sinh(x).
