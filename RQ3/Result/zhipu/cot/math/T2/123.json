Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate a product of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u = ln(x) and dv = (1 + x)dx. Then, we need to find du and v.\\n\\nFor u = ln(x), du = (1/x)dx.\\nFor dv = (1 + x)dx, v = \u222b(1 + x)dx = x + (1/2)x^2 = x + (1/2)x^2 (since the integral of x is (1/2)x^2).\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) * (1 + x)dx = ln(x) * (x + (1/2)x^2) - \u222b(x + (1/2)x^2) * (1/x)dx\\n\\nSimplifying the first term, we get:\\n\\nln(x) * x + (1/2)ln(x) * x^2\\n\\nFor the second term, we need to integrate:\\n\\n\u222b(x/x + (1/2)x)dx = \u222b(1 + (1/2)x)dx = x + (1/4)x^2\\n\\nNow substitute this back into our integration by parts formula:\\n\\nln(x) * x + (1/2)ln(x) * x^2 - (x + (1/4)x^2)\\n\\nCombining like terms, we get:\\n\\nxln(x) - x - (1/4)x^2 + (1/2)ln(x)x^2\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\nxln(x) + (1/4)ln(x)x^2 - x - (1/4)x^2\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into this expression:\\n\\n4ln(4) + (1/4)ln(4)4^2 - 4 - (1/4)4^2\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\n4ln(4) + ln(4)4 - 4 - 4\\n\\nSince 4ln(4) is ln(4^4) = ln(256), we have:\\n\\nln(256) + 4ln(4) - 4 - 4\\n\\nWe know that ln(256) is the natural logarithm of 256, which is 8ln(2) because 256 is 2^8. However, we don't need to calculate the exact value of ln(2) to find the integer part of the expression. We just need to evaluate the expression at x = 4 and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nln(256) + 4ln(4) - 8\\n\\nSince ln(256) is a positive number, and ln(4) is also a positive number, we know that the expression will be greater than 8 (because ln(256) is greater than 8 and 4ln(4) is greater than 0). Therefore, when we subtract 8 from the entire expression, we will get a positive number that is less than the value of ln(256) + 4ln(4).\\n\\nSince we're rounding down to the nearest integer, we only need to consider the integer part of the expression. The exact value of the expression is not necessary. Given that the expression is positive and greater than 0, the integer part will be at least 0. Therefore, the integer result of the expression after rounding down will be:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0\\n\\nHowever, this conclusion seems incorrect based on the values of ln(256) and ln(4). Let's correct the mistake.\\n\\nln(256) + 4ln(4) - 8 = 8ln(2) + 4ln(4) - 8\\n\\nWe know that 4ln(4) is 4 * 2ln(2) because 4 is 2^2, so:\\n\\n8ln(2) + 4 * 2ln(2) - 8 = 8ln(2) + 8ln(2) - 8 = 16ln(2) - 8\\n\\nNow, since we're not calculating the exact values and only interested in the integer part, we know that ln(2) is approximately 0.693. Multiplying this by 16 gives us approximately 11.128, and subtracting 8 gives us approximately 3.128.
