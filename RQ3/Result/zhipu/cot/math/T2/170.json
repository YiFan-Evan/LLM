Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions and is based on the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying integration by parts is easier to solve. We'll set:\\n\\nu = sinh(x)\\ndv = sin(x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to find du and v:\\n\\ndu = cosh(x) dx (since the derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x))\\nv = -cos(x) (since the integral of sin(x) dx is -cos(x))\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x) * sin(x) dx = sinh(x)(-cos(x)) - \u222b(-cos(x)) * cosh(x) dx\\n\u222bsinh(x) * sin(x) dx = -sinh(x)cos(x) + \u222bcos(x)cosh(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral of cos(x)cosh(x) dx is a bit more complex because it involves a product of trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. However, there is a useful identity that can help us here:\\n\\ncos(x)cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x)/2\\n\\nSo, we can rewrite our integral as:\\n\\n\u222bcos(x)cosh(x) dx = \u222b(e^x + e^-x)/2 dx\\n\\nIntegrating this expression gives us:\\n\\n(1/2)\u222be^x dx + (1/2)\u222be^-x dx\\n(1/2)[e^x - e^-x] + (1/2)[-e^-x]\\n(1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x - (1/2)e^-x\\n\\nNow integrate each term separately:\\n\\n(1/2)\u222be^x dx - (1/2)\u222be^-x dx\\n(1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x\\n\\nThese are straightforward integrals:\\n\\n(1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x\\n\\nNow we combine this result with the previous result we obtained from integration by parts:\\n\\n-sinh(x)cos(x) + (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x\\n= -sinh(x)cos(x) + (1/2)e^x - (1/2)e^-x\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into our indefinite integral:\\n\\n- sinh(4)cos(4) + (1/2)e^4 - (1/2)e^-4\\n\\nUsing a calculator to evaluate this expression, we get a decimal number.
