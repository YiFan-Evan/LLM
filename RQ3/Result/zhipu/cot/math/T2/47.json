Integration by parts is based on the product rule for differentiation and is expressed by the formula:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe'll choose u = ln(x) and dv = e^x dx. Then we need to find du and v.\\n\\ndu/dx = 1/x, so du = 1/x dx\\nTo find v, we integrate dv:\\n\u222be^x dx = e^x (since the derivative of e^x with respect to x is e^x)\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222be^x * ln(x) dx = ln(x) * e^x - \u222be^x * (1/x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate the second term on the right side. This is a bit more complex because we have an exponential function and a reciprocal. This is not a standard integral that can be done with simple functions, so we'll have to use integration by parts again. Let's set u = 1/x and dv = e^x dx one more time.\\n\\ndu/dx = -1/x^2, so du = -1/x^2 dx\\nv = e^x (from the previous integration)\\n\\nNow applying integration by parts again:\\n\\n\u222be^x * (1/x) dx = (1/x) * e^x - \u222be^x * (-1/x^2) dx\\n                  = (1/x) * e^x + \u222be^x / x^2 dx\\n\\nThe integral \u222be^x / x^2 dx doesn't have a simple elementary antiderivative, and it's not what we need to calculate the integral of the original function e^x * ln(x). Instead, the second integration by parts should be done with a different approach, which is to recognize that the derivative of e^x/x will be useful here.\\n\\nLet's denote the integral we are looking for as I:\\n\\nI = \u222be^x * (1/x) dx\\n\\nNow, differentiate e^x/x with respect to x:\\n\\nd/dx (e^x/x) = (e^x * x - e^x) / x^2 = e^x * (x - 1) / x^2\\n\\nThis suggests that we can write the integral I as:\\n\\nI = e^x/x + C\\n\\nNow, we can substitute this back into our original integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222be^x * ln(x) dx = ln(x) * e^x - I\\n                 = ln(x) * e^x - (e^x/x + C)\\n\\nNow let's substitute x = 4 into the expression we found for the integral:\\n\\n\u222be^x * ln(x) dx = 4 * e^4 - e^4/4\\n\\nTo find the integer part of this, we can calculate it numerically and then round down:\\n\\nln(4) * e^4 \u2248 1.38629436112 * 54.5981500331 \u2248 75.6819144217\\ne^4/4 \u2248 54.5981500331 / 4 \u2248 13.64953750825\\n\\nSubtracting these:\\n\\n75.6819144217 - 13.64953750825 \u2248 62.03237591345\\n\\nRounding down, we get:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 62\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x*ln(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function 5*(e^x*ln(x)), we can follow the same process as before, but we will also account for the constant multiplier 5 outside the integral.
