Instead, we can recognize that the original function is a product of two functions that are not easily integrated directly, and it might be easier to integrate it as a single function.\\n\\nWe can use the substitution method here. Let's consider the substitution u = cos(x), then du = -sin(x) dx, and dx = -du/sin(x).

Integrating 1/u with respect to u gives us ln|u| + C, where C is the constant of integration.

We'll use the same approach to integrate it, and then we'll multiply the result by 5.\\n\\nFirst, we integrate (1/x)/cos(x) as we did before:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)/cos(x) dx = \u222b(1/cos(x)) * (1/x) dx = \u222bsec(x) * (1/x) dx\\n\\nThis integral can be approached by recognizing that sec(x) dx is the derivative of ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|, and (1/x) dx is the derivative of ln|x|. However, since we are looking for a simple substitution that will work directly, we can use the fact that the integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C. Therefore, we can treat the integral as:\\n\\n\u222bsec(x) * (1/x) dx = \u222bsec(x) d(1/x) = (1/x)\u222bsec(x) dx - \u222b(\u222bsec(x) dx) d(1/x)\\n\\nWe know that \u222bsec(x) dx = ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C, so we can write:\\n\\n\u222bsec(x) * (1/x) dx = (1/x)ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| - \u222bln|sec(x) + tan(x)| d(1/x)\\n\\nSince the integral of ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| with respect to d(1/x) is not straightforward, we can simplify by recognizing that the original integral is the product of functions that can be integrated directly. Let's use the substitution u = cos(x) again, where du = -sin(x) dx, and dx = -du/sin(x). The integral then becomes:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)/cos(x) dx = \u222b(1/u) du = ln|u| + C = ln|cos(x)| + C\\n\\nNow, we multiply this result by 5 to account for the original function being 5 times this integral:\\n\\n5 * \u222b(1/x)/cos(x) dx = 5 * (ln|cos(x)| + C) = 5ln|cos(x)| + 5C\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into the result, we get:\\n\\n5ln|cos(4)| + 5C\\n\\nAgain, we're not concerned with the constant C for the purpose of finding the integer part of the expression. We calculate cos(4) and take the natural logarithm of its absolute value, then multiply by 5:\\n\\n5ln|cos(4)| \u2248 5 * ln|0.65364362086...| \u2248 5 * (-0.432448...)\\n\\nUsing a calculator, we find:\\n\\n5 * (-0.432448...) \u2248 -2.16124...\\n\\nSince we need to round down to the nearest integer, the integer part of -2.16124... is -3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -3\""}]
