Integration by parts is based on the product rule for derivatives and is given by:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = x^(-1) dx.

Instead, we can recognize that e^x * x^(-1) can be integrated directly if we consider the derivative of e^x with respect to x, which is e^x, and the derivative of ln|x| with respect to x, which is 1/x. This suggests that e^x * x^(-1) is the derivative of e^x * ln|x|, but since we have a constant multiple, we must integrate the constant separately.\\n\\nLet's integrate e^x with respect to x:\\n\\n\u222b e^x dx = e^x + C\\n\\nNow, we integrate the constant 5 times the natural logarithm of the absolute value of x:\\n\\n5 * \u222b ln|x| dx\\n\\nThe integral of ln|x| is not straightforward, but since we are looking for the integral of the original function, we can integrate 5 directly with respect to x and multiply the result by e^x * ln|x|:\\n\\n5 * \u222b e^x * x^(-1) dx = 5 * (e^x * ln|x| - \u222b e^x dx)\\n                       = 5 * (e^x * ln|x| - e^x) + C\\n                       = 5 * e^x * (ln|x| - 1) + C\\n\\nNow we have the indefinite integral of the original function.
