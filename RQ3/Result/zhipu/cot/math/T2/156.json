Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions. The formula is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe can choose u = (1/x) and dv = e^x dx. Then, we need to find du and v.\\n\\nIf u = (1/x), then du = -1/x^2 dx.\\n\\nIf dv = e^x dx, then v = e^x (since the integral of e^x is e^x).\\n\\nApplying the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)*e^x dx = (1/x)*e^x - \u222b(-1/x^2)*e^x dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate \u222b(-1/x^2)*e^x dx. To do this, we can use substitution. Let's consider u = -1/x, so that du = 1/x^2 dx. Now the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222be^x du\\n\\nThis is a simple integral, and since du = 1/x^2 dx, we can integrate e^x directly with respect to u:\\n\\n\u222be^x du = e^x + C\\n\\nNow, going back to our original integration by parts expression, we have:\\n\\n(1/x)*e^x - \u222b(-1/x^2)*e^x dx = (1/x)*e^x - (e^x + C)\\n\\nSimplifying this, we get:\\n\\n(1/x)*e^x - e^x = (1/x - 1)*e^x\\n\\nThis is the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)*e^x. Now we need to substitute x = 4 into this result:\\n\\n(1/4 - 1)*e^4 = (-3/4)*e^4\\n\\nTo find the integer result by rounding down, we need to calculate this expression's value and then round down to the nearest integer.

Thus, we have:\\n\\n\u222b 5*((1/x)*e^x) dx = 5 * \u222b ((1/x)*e^x) dx\\n\\nNow we integrate the function (1/x)*e^x, which we can do using integration by parts as described in the previous response. The integral of (1/x)*e^x is (1/x - 1)*e^x. Therefore, we get:\\n\\n5 * \u222b ((1/x)*e^x) dx = 5 * ((1/x - 1)*e^x) + C\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into this result:\\n\\n5 * ((1/4 - 1)*e^4) = 5 * ((-3/4)*e^4)\\n\\nTo find the integer result by rounding down, we calculate this expression's value and then round down to the nearest integer.
