This makes the integral more complex because it involves the product of u and sin(u) with respect to u, but also depends on x through the cosine function.\\n\\nTo proceed, we can rewrite the integral using the substitution without the cosine function:\\n\\n\u222b u * sin(u) du\\n\\nThis is still not a standard integral form that can be easily integrated, but we can use another substitution for the integral of sin(u) with respect to u.

Let's start with the integral:\\n\\n\u222b 5 * sin(x) * sin(sin(x)) dx\\n\\nWe'll use the same substitution as before, let u = sin(x), so du = cos(x) dx.
