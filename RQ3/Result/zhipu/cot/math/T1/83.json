Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products of functions. The formula is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is easier to integrate. We can set u = ln(x) and dv = sinh(x)dx.

However, this integral is not straightforward because it involves the product of an algebraic function (ln(x)) and a transcendental function (sinh(x)).
