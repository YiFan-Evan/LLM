However, for the purpose of this problem, we'll proceed by making an approximation or using numerical integration methods if necessary, but since we're asked to provide an integer result by rounding down, we can use an approximation that gives us a close enough value to do this.\\n\\nLet's proceed with a substitution. Let u = sin(x), then du = cos(x) dx. However, since sin(sin(x)) does not simplify nicely with this substitution, we'll keep the original form and look for another approach.\\n\\nOne approach to tackle this integral is to use a Taylor series expansion for sin(sin(x)) around x = 0, which would give us a polynomial approximation of the integrand that we can integrate term by term. However, this would be a complex process and might not yield a simple expression for the indefinite integral.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the integral, it's clear that we need to use numerical methods to approximate the value of the integral at x = 4. We can use numerical integration techniques such as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, or a calculator's built-in integration function to find an approximation for the definite integral from 0 to 4 and then subtract the value of the integral from 0 to a very small number (like 0.001) to approximate the indefinite integral at x = 4.\\n\\nSince this is a manual calculation and we're looking for an integer result, let's use an approximate value for the integral.
