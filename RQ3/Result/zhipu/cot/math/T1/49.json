Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions and is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is easier to integrate than the original one. A common heuristic is to choose u as the function that becomes simpler when differentiated and dv as the function that is easy to integrate.\\n\\nLet's choose:\\n\\nu = ln(x)\\ndu = (1/x) dx\\n\\ndv = sin(x) dx\\nv = -cos(x)\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) * sin(x) dx = ln(x) * (-cos(x)) - \u222b(-cos(x)) * (1/x) dx\\n\u222bln(x) * sin(x) dx = -ln(x) * cos(x) + \u222bcos(x) / x dx\\n\\nThe integral of cos(x) / x is not straightforward and does not have a simple elementary antiderivative.

However, since we need a numerical answer, we would have to approximate the definite integral from 1 to 4.
