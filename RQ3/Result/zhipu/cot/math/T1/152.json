To resolve this, we need to make a substitution. Let's consider the integral of x^(-1) dx first:\\n\\n\u222b x^(-1) dx = ln|x| + C\\n\\nNow we integrate ln(x) with respect to x. Since we have already established that the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, we can consider the antiderivative of 1/x as ln|x|, and when we multiply it by ln(x), we get:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) d(ln|x|)\\n\\nThis is a bit tricky because it is not a standard form. However, we can use the fact that d(ln|x|) = 1/x dx to rewrite the integral as:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) d(ln|x|) = \u222b ln(x) d(x^(-1))\\n\\nNow we can use integration by parts again:\\n\\nu = ln(x), dv = d(x^(-1))\\ndu = 1/x dx, v = x^(-1)\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) d(x^(-1)) = (ln(x)) * (x^(-1)) - \u222b x^(-1) * (1/x) dx\\n= ln(x)/x - \u222b 1/x^2 dx\\n\\nNow we integrate the remaining term:\\n\\n\u222b 1/x^2 dx = -1/x + C\\n\\nPutting it all together, we have:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x)/(1/x) dx = ln(x)/x - (-1/x) + C\\n= (ln(x) + 1)/x + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n((ln(4) + 1)/4) + C\\n\\nSince we are only interested in the numerical result and not the constant C, we can ignore C for the purpose of this calculation:\\n\\n(ln(4) + 1)/4\\n\\nWe need to calculate this expression and round down to the nearest integer.

So our function becomes:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) * x^(-1) dx\\n\\nThis is a bit tricky because it's not a standard form that we can integrate directly. However, we can use a technique called integration by parts. The idea is to rewrite the function in a way that we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nLet's choose u = ln(x) and dv = x^(-1) dx.

Since the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, we can treat ln(x) as a constant with respect to the variable we're integrating (which is effectively 1/x), and integrate as follows:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) d(1/x) = ln(x) * (1/x) - \u222b (1/x) * (1/x) dx\\n= ln(x)/x - \u222b 1/x^2 dx\\n= ln(x)/x - (-1/x) + C\\n= (ln(x) + 1)/x + C\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n((ln(4) + 1)/4) + C\\n\\nSince we are only interested in the numerical result and not the constant C, we can ignore C for the purpose of this calculation:\\n\\n(ln(4) + 1)/4\\n\\nWe need to calculate this expression and round down to the nearest integer.

Let's correct the integration process:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) dx = x * ln(x) - \u222b x * (1/x) dx = x * ln(x) dx = x * ln(x) - \u222b 1 dx = x * ln(x) - x + C\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into the corrected indefinite integral:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) dx = 4 * ln(4) - 4 + C = 4 * ln(4) - 4 + C\\n\\nSince we are only interested in the part without the constant C, we calculate:\\n\\n4 * ln(4) - 4\\n\\nUsing the property of logarithms:\\n\\n4 * ln(4) = 4 * 2 * ln(2) = 8 * ln(2)\\n\\nNow, we approximate ln(2) as 0.693:\\n\\n8 * 0.693 = 5.544\\n\\nNow we subtract 4:\\n\\n5.544 - 4 = 1.544\\n\\nFinally, we round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1\""}]
