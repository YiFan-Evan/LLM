Let's consider u = e^x. Then, du/dx = e^x, which implies that dx = du/e^x.

Therefore, the value of cos(2e^4) will be a number very close to either -1 or 1, but not an integer. Multiplying this by -1/4 will give us a number very close to either -0.25 or 0.25, but since we are rounding down, we will round to the nearest integer below these values, which is 0.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(e^x)*sin(e^x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function cos(e^x) * sin(e^x), we can use the substitution method as previously described.
