Integration by parts is based on the product rule for derivatives, which states that the derivative of the product of two functions is the first function times the derivative of the second function plus the second function times the derivative of the first function. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying integration by parts is simpler than the original one. Let's set:\\n\\nu = sinh(x)\\ndv = cos(x) dx\\n\\nThen, we need to find du and v:\\n\\ndu = cosh(x) dx\\nv = \u222bcos(x) dx = sin(x)\\n\\nNow we apply integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) - \u222bsin(x)cosh(x) dx\\n\\nHowever, notice that the new integral \u222bsin(x)cosh(x) dx is the same form as the original integral, which means we are not making progress. This is because sinh(x) and cos(x) are not a typical pair for direct integration by parts. Instead, we can use a trigonometric identity and a substitution.\\n\\nThe identity that will help us is:\\n\\nsinh(x) * cos(x) = (e^x - e^(-x))/2 * cos(x) = (e^x * cos(x)/2) - (e^(-x) * cos(x)/2)\\n\\nNow let's integrate each part separately:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = \u222b(e^x * cos(x)/2) dx - \u222b(e^(-x) * cos(x)/2) dx\\n\\nFor each of these integrals, we can use integration by parts again. For the first integral, let's set:\\n\\nu = e^x\\ndv = cos(x) dx / 2\\n\\ndu = e^x dx\\nv = sin(x) / 2\\n\\nApplying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b(e^x * cos(x)/2) dx = (e^x * sin(x)/2) - \u222b(e^x * sin(x)/2) dx\\n\\nFor the second integral, we can do the same:\\n\\nu = e^(-x)\\ndv = cos(x) dx / 2\\n\\ndu = -e^(-x) dx\\nv = sin(x) / 2\\n\\nApplying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b(e^(-x) * cos(x)/2) dx = (e^(-x) * sin(x)/2) - \u222b(-e^(-x) * sin(x)/2) dx\\n\\nNow we have a system of two integrals that we need to solve. However, this process is getting complicated and can be simplified by using another substitution or recognizing that the integral of the product of sinh and cos is related to hyperbolic functions and their identities.\\n\\nThe integral of sinh(x) * cos(x) can be found using the identity for the derivative of the hyperbolic sine function:\\n\\nd/dx (sinh(x)) = cosh(x)\\n\\nThus, we can rewrite the integral as:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = 1/2 * \u222bsinh(x) d(sinh(x))\\n\\nThis is a straightforward integral of a function with respect to its derivative, which gives us:\\n\\n1/2 * \u222bsinh(x) d(sinh(x)) = 1/2 * sinh^2(x) + C\\n\\nNow we can substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n1/2 * sinh^2(4) + C\\n\\nWe do not need to calculate the constant C, as we are asked to provide the integer result after rounding down. Let's calculate sinh(4):\\n\\nsinh(4) \u2248 27.2899\\n\\nNow we square it and multiply by 1/2:\\n\\n1/2 * (27.2899)^2 \u2248 1/2 * 746.883\\n\\nThis result is approximately 373.4415.
