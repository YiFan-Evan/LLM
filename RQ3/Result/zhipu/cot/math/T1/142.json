We will have to use a substitution method.\\n\\nLet's use the substitution u = sinh(x).

Let's try this again with the correct process.\\n\\nTo integrate the function sin(sinh(x)), we'll use a substitution. Let's set u = sinh(x).

Instead, we need to recognize that the derivative of cos(sinh(x)) is -sin(sinh(x)) * cosh(x), which suggests that the integral of sin(sinh(x)) * cosh(x) with respect to x is cos(sinh(x)).\\n\\nSo, we can rewrite the integral as:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) cosh(x) du\\n\\nSince we're substituting u for sinh(x), we can use the identity cosh^2(x) = 1 + sinh^2(x) to express cosh(x) in terms of u:\\n\\ncosh(x) = \u221a(1 + sinh^2(x)) = \u221a(1 + u^2)\\n\\nNow the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) \u221a(1 + u^2) du\\n\\nThis is still not a standard integral, and we don't have a straightforward way to integrate this directly.

The integral of sin(sinh(x)) is not straightforward and does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. This means we cannot directly integrate sin(sinh(x)) to find a simple expression in terms of x that we can then evaluate at x = 4.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the integral, we would typically require special functions or numerical methods to find the indefinite integral of sin(sinh(x)). Since we are looking for a simple integer result by rounding down the expression after substituting x = 4, and given that we cannot find an elementary antiderivative, we are at an impasse with the information provided.\\n\\nIn a typical educational setting, we would not be expected to integrate such a complex function without the use of advanced techniques or computational tools. Therefore, with the information and tools at hand, we cannot provide a simple integer result for this problem.\\n\\nIf you are looking for an approximate numerical solution, you would need to use numerical integration methods, which are beyond the scope of basic calculus and cannot be represented as a single integer.\""}]
