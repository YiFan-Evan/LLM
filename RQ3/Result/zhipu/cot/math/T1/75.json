The sine integral is defined as:\\n\\nSi(x) = \u222b sin(t)/t dt from 0 to x\\n\\nSince we are dealing with cos(x)/x, we can use the fact that the integral of cos(x) is sin(x), and we can treat 1/x as a constant to be integrated.

Instead, we can use the relationship between the cosine and sine functions and their derivatives to express the integral in terms of Si(x).
