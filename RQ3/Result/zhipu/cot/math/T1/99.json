Instead, we'll use the fact that the natural logarithm of a number greater than 1 is greater than 0, and the sum of sec(4) and tan(4) will also be a positive number (since sec(x) is always positive in the interval (0, \u03c0/2) and tan(x) can be positive or negative depending on the value of x, but their sum will be positive for x = 4).\\n\\nTherefore, the expression will be a positive number greater than ln(4), which is approximately 1.386294.
