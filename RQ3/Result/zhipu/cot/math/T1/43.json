Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe'll choose e^x as u and cos(x) dx as dv. Then, we'll need to find dv and du:\\n\\nu = e^x, then du = e^x dx\\ndv = cos(x) dx, then v = sin(x)\\n\\nApplying the integration by parts formula, we get:\\n\\n\u222be^x cos(x) dx = e^x sin(x) - \u222bsin(x) e^x dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate \u222bsin(x) e^x dx.
