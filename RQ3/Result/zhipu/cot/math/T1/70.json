However, since we're dealing with a product, we can't simply multiply these results. Instead, we need to use integration by parts or recognize a pattern.\\n\\nLet's use a substitution to make this easier. Notice that the derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x). If we let u = cos(x), then du = -sin(x)dx. If we let dv = sinh(x)dx, then v = cosh(x). Now let's apply integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx = uv - \u222b v du\\n\u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx = cos(x) * cosh(x) - \u222b cosh(x) * (-sin(x)) dx\\n\u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx = cos(x) * cosh(x) + \u222b sin(x) * cosh(x) dx\\n\\nNow we have to integrate sin(x) * cosh(x) again. We can use integration by parts once more or recognize that this integral will also involve cos(x) * sinh(x). Let's denote the original integral as I:\\n\\nI = \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx\\nI = cos(x) * cosh(x) + \u222b sin(x) * cosh(x) dx\\n\\nNow we integrate sin(x) * cosh(x) again using substitution or recognize that it's the same integral we started with:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x) * cosh(x) dx = I\\n\\nNow we have:\\n\\nI = cos(x) * cosh(x) + I\\n\\nThis doesn't help us much because we have I on both sides. However, we can add \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx to both sides to get:\\n\\n2I = cos(x) * cosh(x) + \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx + \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx\\n\\nNow we can divide by 2:\\n\\nI = 1/2 [cos(x) * cosh(x) + \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx]\\n\\nBut we know that \u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx is just I, so we can substitute I back in:\\n\\nI = 1/2 [cos(x) * cosh(x) + I]\\n\\nNow we can solve for I:\\n\\nI - 1/2 I = 1/2 cos(x) * cosh(x)\\n1/2 I = 1/2 cos(x) * cosh(x)\\nI = cos(x) * cosh(x)\\n\\nSo the indefinite integral of cos(x) * sinh(x) is:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x) * sinh(x) dx = cos(x) * cosh(x) + C\\n\\nNow, to find the value of this integral when x = 4, we substitute x with 4:\\n\\ncos(4) * cosh(4) + C\\n\\nWe don't have the constant C, but since we're asked to round down to the nearest integer, we'll ignore C for now and evaluate the expression with x = 4:\\n\\ncos(4) * cosh(4)\\n\\nUsing a calculator to find the numerical values:\\n\\ncos(4) \u2248 -0.6536\\ncosh(4) \u2248 27.3082\\n\\nNow multiply these values:\\n\\n-0.6536 * 27.3082 \u2248 -17.8105\\n\\nSince we're asked for the integer result by rounding down, we'll take the floor of -17.8105:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -18\""}]
