Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate a product of functions, and it is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is easier to integrate than the original. A common strategy is to choose u as the part that becomes simpler when differentiated and dv as the part that is easy to integrate.\\n\\nLet's set u = x^2 and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = 2x dx and v = e^x.\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222be^x * x^2 dx = x^2 * e^x - \u222b2x * e^x dx\\n\\nWe need to apply integration by parts again to the remaining integral \u222b2x * e^x dx:\\n\\nLet's set u = 2x and dv = e^x dx.

We can use the approximation that e (the base of the natural logarithm) is about 2.71828. Therefore, e^4 is approximately 2.71828^4, which is a bit more than 54 (since 2.7^2 is a bit more than 7, and 7^2 is 49, so 2.7^4 is a bit more than 54). Multiplying this by 10 gives us a number a bit more than 540.
