Integration by parts is based on the product rule for derivatives and is given by the formula:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe'll let u = ln(sin(x)) and dv = dx.

Let's set u = sin(x), so du = cos(x)dx. Our integral now becomes:\\n\\n\u222bx * du/u\\n\\nThis is a simple logarithmic integral. The integral of x with respect to u is x*u - \u222bu du, but since we are integrating with respect to u and not x, we don't have the x term anymore:\\n\\n\u222bx * du/u = \u222bln(u)du\\n\\nThe antiderivative of ln(u) with respect to u is u * ln(u) - u + C, but since we are integrating with respect to x, we substitute back sin(x) for u:\\n\\n\u222bx * cos(x)/sin(x)dx = sin(x) * ln(sin(x)) - sin(x) + C\\n\\nNow we combine our results:\\n\\n\u222bln(sin(x))dx = x * ln(sin(x)) - (sin(x) * ln(sin(x)) - sin(x)) + C\\n= x * ln(sin(x)) - sin(x) * ln(sin(x)) + sin(x) + C\\n= (x - sin(x)) * ln(sin(x)) + sin(x) + C\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into this expression and round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\n(4 - sin(4)) * ln(sin(4)) + sin(4)\\n\\nWe evaluate this expression numerically:\\n\\nsin(4) \u2248 -0.7568 (since the sine function is negative in the fourth quadrant)\\nln(sin(4)) is a complex number because the sine of 4 radians is negative, and the natural logarithm is not defined for negative numbers. However, since we're asked for the integer part, we can't proceed with a complex number. There seems to be a mistake because the natural logarithm of a negative number isn't real, and the integral we've found isn't valid for negative values of sin(x).\\n\\nTo correct this, we should have used the fact that the integral of ln(sin(x)) will only be real when sin(x) is positive. Since sin(4) is negative, we cannot correctly evaluate the integral at x = 4 in the real number domain. Therefore, there's no valid integer answer for this particular problem as stated because the function involves taking the natural logarithm of a negative number. \\n\\nIf we assume there was a mistake in the problem statement and that x should be in a domain where sin(x) is positive, we would need to recalculate the integral with a correct value of x where sin(x) > 0.

Let's address the integral of ln(sin(x)) properly, assuming we are dealing with x in the domain where sin(x) is positive, as the natural logarithm is not defined for negative numbers.\\n\\nThe integral of ln(sin(x)) with respect to x is:\\n\\n\u222b ln(sin(x)) dx\\n\\nWe'll use integration by parts with u = ln(sin(x)) and dv = dx.

Let u = sin(x), then du = cos(x) dx, and dx = du/cos(x). However, this will not simplify the integral nicely. Instead, let's recognize that x * cot(x) dx is a form that can be integrated using integration by parts again, with u = x and dv = cot(x) dx. The antiderivative of cot(x) is -ln|sin(x)|, so:\\n\\n\u222b x * cot(x) dx = -x * ln|sin(x)| + \u222b ln|sin(x)| dx\\n\\nWe already have the integral of ln|sin(x)|, which is what we started with. This suggests we are in a loop that does not simplify the problem.
