Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe will choose e^x as u and x^2 as dv. The derivative of e^x is e^x, and the integral of x^2 with respect to x is (1/3)x^3. However, to apply integration by parts, we need to integrate dv, which means we will actually be integrating x^2 dx, resulting in (1/3)x^3 dx.

We will use integration by parts again, but this time let's choose (1/3)x^3 as u and e^x dx as dv.
