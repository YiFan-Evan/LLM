The integral of cos(u) with respect to u is sin(u), and the integral of e^u with respect to u is e^u. However, since we are multiplying the result of the first integral by e^u and taking the integral of that product, we can use the fact that the integral of e^u * cos(u) is e^u * (sin(u) - cos(u) + C), but we need to integrate this again to get the full integral, which is a bit more complicated.
