However, for the purpose of this problem, we will treat it as a single term that we will integrate symbolically and then evaluate numerically at x=4.\\n\\nThe integral of x is straightforward. The power rule for integration states that the integral of x^n dx is (1/(n+1)) * x^(n+1) + C, where n is any real number except -1.
