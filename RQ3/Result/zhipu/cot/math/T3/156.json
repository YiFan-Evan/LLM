Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products of functions, and it is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe'll choose u = (1/x) and dv = e^x dx. Then we need to find du and v.\\n\\ndu/dx = -1/x^2, so du = -1/x^2 dx\\n\u222be^x dx = e^x (since the derivative of e^x is e^x itself), so v = e^x\\n\\nApplying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)*e^x dx = (1/x)*e^x - \u222be^x*(-1/x^2) dx\\n= (1/x)*e^x + \u222be^x/(x^2) dx\\n\\nThe integral of e^x/(x^2) doesn't have a simple elementary antiderivative, but we only need to find the indefinite integral of the original function, not solve an additional integral.

As previously discussed, this term does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, but we can state it as (1/x)*e^x + Ei(x), where Ei(x) is the exponential integral function.
