The function is a bit tricky because it's not one of the standard forms that can be integrated directly. We can break the function into two parts and integrate each separately.\\n\\nLet's start by separating the function:\\n\\n\u222b (1+x)/ln(x) dx = \u222b 1/ln(x) dx + \u222b x/ln(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral of 1/ln(x) is a special case and is known as the logarithmic integral function, denoted as Li(x). There is no elementary function for this integral, but we can leave it as Li(x) for now.\\n\\nFor the second part, \u222b x/ln(x) dx, we can use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = 1/ln(x) dx. Then du = dx and we need to find v. The integral of 1/ln(x) with respect to x is Li(x), so v = Li(x). Now we apply integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b x/ln(x) dx = uv - \u222b v du\\n                = x Li(x) - \u222b Li(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral of Li(x) is not elementary, but we can leave it as is for now. So, the indefinite integral of the original function is:\\n\\n\u222b (1+x)/ln(x) dx = Li(x) + x Li(x) - \u222b Li(x) dx\\n                   = x Li(x) - \u222b Li(x) dx + Li(x) (since the integral of Li(x) dx cancels out)\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\nx Li(x) - \u222b Li(x) dx + Li(x) evaluated at x = 4\\n= 4 Li(4) - \u222b Li(x) dx evaluated at x = 4 + Li(4)\\n\\nSince we don't have a closed-form expression for the integral of Li(x), we will approximate the value of the integral using numerical methods if needed. However, since we are interested in the integer part of the result, we can ignore the term - \u222b Li(x) dx because it's an integral constant and will not affect the integer part of our final result.\\n\\nThus, we are left with:\\n\\n4 Li(4) + Li(4)\\n\\nTo find the numerical value of Li(4), we can use a calculator or software that can handle special functions. Assuming we find the numerical value of Li(4) (which is approximately 1.922788), we can calculate:\\n\\n4 * 1.922788 + 1.922788 \u2248 7.690952 + 1.922788 \u2248 9.613740\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+x)/ln(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function (1+x)/ln(x) + x, we can integrate each term separately. Let's start by integrating each part:\\n\\n1. The integral of (1+x)/ln(x) can be split into two parts: \u222b1/ln(x)dx and \u222bx/ln(x)dx. As mentioned earlier, \u222b1/ln(x)dx is the logarithmic integral function, Li(x), which does not have an elementary antiderivative. However, for the purpose of this problem, we can treat it as a single term that we'll call Li(x) for now.\\n\\n2. For the integral \u222bx/ln(x)dx, we can use integration by parts with u = x and dv = 1/ln(x)dx, which gives us du = dx and v = Li(x). Using integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n   \u222bx/ln(x)dx = uv - \u222bvdu\\n               = xLi(x) - \u222bLi(x)dx\\n\\n   Since we don't have an elementary antiderivative for Li(x), we'll leave this term as is.\\n\\n3. The integral of x with respect to x is simple:\\n\\n   \u222bxdx = x^2/2\\n\\nNow, combining these parts, the indefinite integral of the original function is:\\n\\n\u222b((1+x)/ln(x) + x)dx = Li(x) + xLi(x) - \u222bLi(x)dx + x^2/2\\n\\nThe term -\u222bLi(x)dx cancels out with Li(x), so we are left with:\\n\\nLi(x) + xLi(x) + x^2/2\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\nLi(4) + 4Li(4) + 4^2/2\\n= Li(4) + 4Li(4) + 8\\n\\nSince we are interested in the integer part of the result and we don't have an exact value for Li(4), we can't calculate the exact numerical result. However, since we are rounding down to the nearest integer, we can estimate Li(4) to be approximately 1.922788, as given in the previous example. Using this approximation:\\n\\nLi(4) + 4Li(4) + 8 \u2248 1.922788 + 4(1.922788) + 8\\n\u2248 1.922788 + 7.690952 + 8\\n\u2248 17.613740\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 17\""}]
