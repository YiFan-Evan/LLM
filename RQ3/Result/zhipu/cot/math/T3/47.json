Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions, and it is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is easier to integrate than the original. For this integral, let's choose:\\n\\nu = ln(x)  because the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, which is easier to integrate than e^x.\\ndv = e^x dx because the antiderivative of e^x dx is simply e^x.\\n\\nNow we calculate du and v:\\n\\ndu = (1/x) dx\\nv = \u222be^x dx = e^x\\n\\nApplying the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222be^x * ln(x) dx = e^x * ln(x) - \u222be^x * (1/x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate \u222be^x * (1/x) dx. This is a bit tricky because it's not an elementary integral. However, we can use the fact that the integral of e^x/x is the exponential integral Ei(x), which is not an elementary function and can't be expressed in terms of elementary functions.

We also ignore the Ei(4) because it's not an elementary function and we can't calculate its exact value, but since it's not an integer, it won't affect the rounding down process either.\\n\\nWe are left with:\\n\\ne^4 * ln(4)\\n\\nUsing a calculator to approximate this value:\\n\\ne^4 * ln(4) \u2248 54.59815003314423 * 1.3862943611198906 \u2248 75.795825774566\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 75\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x*ln(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function e^x * ln(x) + x, we can integrate each term separately.
