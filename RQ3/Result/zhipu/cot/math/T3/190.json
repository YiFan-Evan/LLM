Let u = 1/x, then du = -1/x^2 dx, which means that dx = -x^2 du.\\n\\nHowever, this substitution complicates the integral because we have an x multiplying the sinh function. Instead, let's use another substitution: let t = 1/x, so dt = -1/x^2 dx, and dx = -x^2 dt. But since we have x in the integrand, we can multiply and divide by x to keep the x in the integral:\\n\\n\u222bsinh((1/x)) * x dx = \u222bsinh(t) * (-x) * (-1/x^2) dx\\n                      = \u222bsinh(t) dt\\n\\nNow the integral is much simpler because it's the integral of sinh(t) with respect to t. The integral of sinh(t) is cosh(t), so we have:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(t) dt = cosh(t) + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute back t = 1/x:\\n\\n\u222bsinh((1/x)) * x dx = cosh(1/x) + C\\n\\nNow let's evaluate this expression at x = 4:\\n\\ncosh(1/4) + C\\n\\nSince we're not including the constant C in our answer, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer result.

The integral of sinh(1/x) can be found using a substitution. Let's use u = 1/x, so du = -1/x^2 dx, which means that dx = -x^2 du. However, this substitution will not simplify the integral because we still have x^2 in the denominator. Instead, we'll leave the sinh(1/x) term as is for now and integrate x separately.\\n\\nThe integral of x with respect to x is (1/2)x^2.\\n\\nNow we need to integrate sinh(1/x). The integral of sinh(u) with respect to u is cosh(u).
