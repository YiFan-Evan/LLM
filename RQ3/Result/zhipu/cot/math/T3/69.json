Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions, and it is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe can choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is easier to integrate. Let's set:\\n\\nu = ln(x)\\ndv = 1/sin(x) dx\\n\\nTo find dv, we need to integrate the derivative of sin(x), which is cos(x), so:\\n\\ndv = \u222bcos(x)/sin(x) dx = \u222bcsc(x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to find du:\\n\\ndu = d/dx [ln(x)] dx = 1/x dx\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bln(x)/sin(x) dx = ln(x) \u222bcsc(x) dx - \u222b\u222bcsc(x) dx * 1/x dx\\n\\nThe integral of csc(x) is -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|, so we have:\\n\\n\u222bln(x)/sin(x) dx = ln(x)(-ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|) - \u222b(-ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|)/x dx\\n\\nThis second integral is not elementary and would require another integration by parts or a more advanced technique. However, since we are only interested in the value of the integral at x = 4, we can use numerical methods to approximate the value if needed.\\n\\nFor the purpose of this problem, let's assume we have found the antiderivative and denote it as F(x).

We'll use the same integration by parts method as before, with a slight adjustment because we have the additional x term to consider.\\n\\nFor the integral of ln(x)/sin(x), we again use integration by parts with:\\n\\nu = ln(x)\\ndv = 1/sin(x) dx\\n\\nWe already know from the previous explanation that dv = \u222bcsc(x) dx, and du = 1/x dx. However, as before, the resulting integral after applying integration by parts will involve an expression that cannot be integrated in terms of elementary functions.\\n\\nSince we're interested in the indefinite integral, we'll leave the integral of ln(x)/sin(x) as an unevaluated integral and denote it as I.

In a real-world scenario, we would use numerical integration methods to approximate the value of I at x = 4.\\n\\nFor the sake of this problem, let's assume we've calculated I(4) and obtained a numerical value.
