Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate a product of two functions, and it is based on the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is simpler than the original. We can set:\\n\\nu = ln(x) then du = 1/x dx\\ndv = (1+e^x) dx then v = x + e^x\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b(1+e^x)*ln(x) dx = (ln(x))*(x + e^x) - \u222b(x + e^x)*(1/x) dx\\n\\nWe now need to integrate the second term on the right side of the equation. The integral of (x + e^x)*(1/x) dx can be split into two separate integrals:\\n\\n\u222bx/x dx + \u222be^x/x dx = \u222b1 dx + \u222be^x/x dx\\n\\nThe first integral is straightforward:\\n\\n\u222b1 dx = x\\n\\nThe second integral, \u222be^x/x dx, is not elementary and does not have a simple antiderivative in terms of standard functions. However, since we're only interested in the value of the integral when x = 4, we can consider the integral as a constant for our purposes, and we don't need to calculate it explicitly.\\n\\nSo our indefinite integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b(1+e^x)*ln(x) dx = (ln(x))*(x + e^x) - (x + \u222be^x/x dx)\\n\\nNow, we substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n[(ln(4))*(4 + e^4) - (4 + \u222be^x/x dx evaluated at x = 4)]\\n\\nSince \u222be^x/x dx is a constant when evaluated at a specific point, it will not affect the integer part of our result when we round down. Therefore, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer result:\\n\\n[ln(4)*(4 + e^4) - 4]\\n\\nNow we calculate the numerical value of the expression without the constant:\\n\\nln(4) \u2248 1.38629436112 (using natural logarithm)\\ne^4 \u2248 54.5981500331 (using the base of natural logarithm)\\n\\nSo:\\n\\n[1.38629436112 * (4 + 54.5981500331) - 4]\\n[1.38629436112 * 58.5981500331 - 4]\\n[81.0175426208 - 4]\\n\u2248 77.0175426208\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 77\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1+e^x)*ln(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function (1+e^x)*ln(x) + x, we can integrate each term separately.
