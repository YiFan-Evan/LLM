Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions, and it is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nWe'll let u = sin(x) and dv = sinh(x) dx. Then we need to find du and v.\\n\\ndu/dx = cos(x) so du = cos(x) dx\\n\u222b sinh(x) dx = cosh(x) so v = cosh(x)\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x) * sinh(x) dx = sin(x) * cosh(x) - \u222b cosh(x) * cos(x) dx\\n\\nWe need to integrate cosh(x) * cos(x) again. This is a bit more complicated, but we can use integration by parts again, or recognize that cosh(x) * cos(x) is a product of hyperbolic and trigonometric functions which does not have a simple elementary antiderivative.
