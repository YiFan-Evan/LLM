Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate a product of functions, and it is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u and dv such that the resulting integral is easier to manage:\\n\\nu = ln(cos(x)) \\ndu = -sin(x)/cos(x) dx\\ndv = e^x dx\\nv = e^x\\n\\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b ln(cos(x)) * e^x dx = e^x * ln(cos(x)) - \u222b e^x * (-sin(x)/cos(x)) dx\\n\\nWe now need to integrate \u222b e^x * (-sin(x)/cos(x)) dx. This can be rewritten as -\u222b e^x * tan(x) dx. This is a more complex integral that requires integration by parts again, or recognition of the derivative of e^x * tan(x) which is e^x * tan(x) + e^x * sec^2(x), from which we can isolate the integral of e^x * tan(x) and solve for it.\\n\\nLet's do integration by parts again:\\n\\nu = tan(x)\\ndu = sec^2(x) dx\\ndv = e^x dx\\nv = e^x\\n\\nNow apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b e^x * tan(x) dx = e^x * tan(x) - \u222b e^x * sec^2(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral of e^x * sec^2(x) is not straightforward, but we can notice that its derivative will include e^x * tan(x), which is part of the original expression. So we have a situation where the integral of the derivative will cancel out the integral of the function itself. This is a common situation when dealing with integrals involving trigonometric functions and exponentials.\\n\\nWe can write the equation for the original integral as:\\n\\nI = e^x * ln(cos(x)) - I + \u222b e^x * sec^2(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we can rearrange the equation to solve for I:\\n\\n2I = e^x * ln(cos(x)) + \u222b e^x * sec^2(x) dx\\n\\nI = (1/2) * e^x * ln(cos(x)) + (1/2) * \u222b e^x * sec^2(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral \u222b e^x * sec^2(x) dx can be solved by substitution. Let's denote this integral as J:\\n\\nJ = \u222b e^x * sec^2(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we differentiate both sides with respect to x:\\n\\ndJ/dx = e^x * sec^2(x)\\n\\nThis implies that J = (1/2) * e^x * tan(x) + K, where K is a constant of integration. We can now substitute J back into the equation for I:\\n\\nI = (1/2) * e^x * ln(cos(x)) + (1/2) * ((1/2) * e^x * tan(x) + K)\\n\\nNow we have the indefinite integral of the function. To find the value at x = 4, we substitute 4 into the equation and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nHowever, the expression is quite complex and not straightforward to evaluate analytically. To find the exact integer result, we would typically use numerical methods or software. Since we're not using any software here, let's simplify the problem by ignoring the constant K, as it will not affect the value when we substitute x = 4 and round down.\\n\\nLet's approximate the value numerically:\\n\\nI \u2248 (1/2) * e^4 * ln(cos(4)) + (1/4) * e^4 * tan(4)\\n\\nUsing a calculator, we can find the approximate numerical value of this expression at x = 4, and then round down to the nearest integer to get the final answer.\\n\\nAfter calculating the value, let's round down to the nearest integer and provide the final answer. \\n\\n(Note: As an AI, I don't have the capability to execute code or calculations in real-time, so I will not be able to provide the numerical result.

This means we can integrate ln(cos(x))*e^x and x individually and then add the results together.\\n\\nLet's start with the first term, ln(cos(x))*e^x. As with the previous problem, we'll need to use integration by parts. However, the presence of the x term means we can directly integrate x without any complications.\\n\\nLet's integrate each term:\\n\\n1. For the term x, the integral is straightforward:\\n\u222b x dx = (1/2)x^2\\n\\n2. For the term ln(cos(x))*e^x, we'll use integration by parts.

However, we can recognize that the derivative of e^x * tan(x) is e^x * tan(x) + e^x * sec^2(x). This suggests that if we integrate e^x * tan(x) dx, we would get e^x * tan(x) + C, where C is a constant. Since we are only looking for the indefinite integral, we can ignore the constant for now and focus on the form of the solution.\\n\\nSo, we have:\\n\u222b ln(cos(x))*e^x dx = e^x * ln(cos(x)) + e^x * tan(x) + C\\n\\nNow we add the integral of x to our result:\\n\u222b (ln(cos(x))*e^x + x) dx = (e^x * ln(cos(x)) + e^x * tan(x)) + (1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nNow we can evaluate this expression at x = 4. Let's do that, ignoring the constant C since it will not affect the result when we round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\nResult at x = 4 = (e^4 * ln(cos(4)) + e^4 * tan(4)) + (1/2)*4^2\\n\\nTo find the exact integer result, you would use a calculator to evaluate this expression at x = 4 and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nSince I cannot perform the actual calculation, I'll describe the process you would follow:\\n\\n1. Calculate e^4 * ln(cos(4)) + e^4 * tan(4) using a calculator.\\n2. Calculate (1/2)*4^2, which is 8.\\n3. Add the results of steps 1 and 2.\\n4. Round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nThe final answer would be presented as:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [Insert the integer result here after performing the calculation].\""}]
