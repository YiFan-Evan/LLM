Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products, and it is based on the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe'll choose u = cos(x) and dv = (1/x)dx. Then, we need to find du and v.\\n\\ndu = -sin(x)dx (since the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x))\\nv = \u222b(1/x)dx = ln|x| (since the integral of 1/x is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of x)\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)*cos(x)dx = cos(x)ln|x| - \u222bln|x|(-sin(x))dx\\n\\nWe now need to integrate \u222bln|x|(-sin(x))dx. This is a bit more complicated because it's another product that we would need to integrate by parts. However, we can notice that the integral of sin(x)/x is related to the sine integral function Si(x), which doesn't have a simple elementary antiderivative. But we are interested in the value of the integral at x=4, not the general antiderivative.\\n\\nSince we are looking for an indefinite integral, we will leave the integral of sin(x)/x as is, because we are going to evaluate it at a specific point (x=4), and the constant of integration will cancel out when we subtract the value of the integral at x=0 (assuming that's our lower limit, as we're looking for an indefinite integral).\\n\\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of (1/x)*cos(x) can be expressed as:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)*cos(x)dx = cos(x)ln|x| + \u222bsin(x)/xdx\\n\\nNow we will substitute x=4 into the result of the indefinite integral, leaving the integral of sin(x)/x unevaluated since it will cancel out when we consider the difference at x=4 and x=0 (or any constant lower limit):\\n\\ncos(4)ln|4| + \u222bsin(x)/xdx evaluated from 0 to 4\\n\\nWe are interested in the integer part of this expression, and since the sine integral function Si(x) does not have a simple expression, we will ignore it for the purpose of finding an integer result.

The integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals.\\n\\nFirst, we'll integrate (1/x)*cos(x) using integration by parts, as we did in the previous example. Let's choose u = cos(x) and dv = (1/x)dx. Then we find du = -sin(x)dx and v = ln|x|.\\n\\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)*cos(x)dx = cos(x)ln|x| - \u222bln|x|(-sin(x))dx\\n\\nNow, let's integrate the second term, x. The integral of x with respect to x is simply (1/2)x^2.\\n\\nPutting it all together, we have:\\n\\n\u222b[(1/x)*cos(x) + x]dx = \u222b(1/x)*cos(x)dx + \u222bxdx\\n                       = cos(x)ln|x| - \u222bln|x|(-sin(x))dx + (1/2)x^2\\n\\nWe can leave the integral \u222bln|x|(-sin(x))dx as is because it's not necessary for finding the value at a specific point.
