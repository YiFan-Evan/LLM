But we can use the identity cos^2(x) = 1 - sin^2(x) = 1 - u^2. Thus, cos(x) = sqrt(1 - u^2). Now we can rewrite the integral with respect to u:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(u) (du/sqrt(1 - u^2))\\n\\nThe integral of sinh(u) with respect to u is simply -cosh(u) + C, where C is the constant of integration.

The indefinite integral of a sum is the sum of the indefinite integrals of each term.\\n\\nFirst, let's integrate the sinh(sin(x)) term. We already discussed that this is not a straightforward integral and does not result in a simple elementary function. However, for the purpose of this problem, we don't actually need to find the exact form of this integral; we just need to evaluate the integral at x = 4 and round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nThe integral of x is straightforward:\\n\\n\u222bx dx = (1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nNow, let's consider the indefinite integral of f(x):\\n\\n\u222b(sinh(sin(x)) + x) dx = \u222bsinh(sin(x)) dx + \u222bx dx\\n\\nSince we're not required to find the exact form of the integral of sinh(sin(x)), we'll leave it as an unevaluated integral.
