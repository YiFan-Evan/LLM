Integration by parts is based on the product rule for differentiation and is given by the formula:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u = ln(sin(x)) and dv = dx. Then we need to find du and v. \\n\\ndu/dx of ln(sin(x)) is 1/sin(x) * cos(x), so du = (cos(x)/sin(x))dx.\\nThe integral of dv = dx is just x, so v = x.\\n\\nApplying the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bln(sin(x))dx = x * ln(sin(x)) - \u222bx * (cos(x)/sin(x))dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate the second term, which is a bit tricky because it's a product of x and a trigonometric function. To do this, we'll use a substitution. Let's consider u = x, then du = dx, and let's consider dv = (cos(x)/sin(x))dx. To integrate dv, we can rewrite it as (-du/sin^2(x)) because d(-1/sin(x)) = cos(x)/sin^2(x)dx (chain rule and derivative of -csc(x)).\\n\\n\u222bx * (cos(x)/sin(x))dx = -\u222bx d(-1/sin(x)) = -x(-1/sin(x)) - \u222b(-1/sin(x))dx\\n= x/sin(x) + \u222bcsc(x)dx\\n\\nThe integral of csc(x) is -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|.\\n\\nSo the integral of our original function becomes:\\n\\n\u222bln(sin(x))dx = x * ln(sin(x)) + x/sin(x) - ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n4 * ln(sin(4)) + 4/sin(4) - ln|csc(4) + cot(4)|\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we can use a calculator to find the numerical value of this expression at x = 4 and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nLet's assume we have calculated the value and obtained a numerical result.

We'll just use the result from the previous explanation.\\n\\nThe integral of x is straightforward; it's (1/2)x^2.\\n\\nSo, the indefinite integral of the function ln(sin(x)) + x is:\\n\\n\u222b[ln(sin(x)) + x] dx = \u222bln(sin(x)) dx + \u222bx dx\\n\\nUsing the result from before for \u222bln(sin(x)) dx and adding the integral of x, we get:\\n\\n\u222bln(sin(x)) dx = x * ln(sin(x)) + x/sin(x) - ln|csc(x) + cot(x)| + C1\\n\u222bx dx = (1/2)x^2 + C2\\n\\nCombining them, we have:\\n\\n\u222b[ln(sin(x)) + x] dx = x * ln(sin(x)) + x/sin(x) - ln|csc(x) + cot(x)| + (1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n4 * ln(sin(4)) + 4/sin(4) - ln|csc(4) + cot(4)| + (1/2)*4^2\\n\\nWe can calculate this value using a calculator.
