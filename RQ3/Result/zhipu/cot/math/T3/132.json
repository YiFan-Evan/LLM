We'll start with the first term, cos(sinh(x)).\\n\\nAs before, we'll use a substitution for the first term. Let u = sinh(x), then du = cosh(x)dx, and dx = du/cosh(x). The integral of cos(sinh(x)) with respect to x becomes:\\n\\n\u222b cos(sinh(x)) dx = \u222b cos(u) (du/cosh(x))\\n\\nSince cosh(x) does not appear in the integrand, we can treat it as a constant and integrate cos(u) with respect to u:\\n\\n\u222b cos(u) du = sin(u) + C1\\n\\nSubstituting back u = sinh(x), we get:\\n\\nsin(sinh(x)) + C1\\n\\nNow, for the second term, the integral of x with respect to x is simple:\\n\\n\u222b x dx = (1/2)x^2 + C2\\n\\nCombining both integrals, we have the indefinite integral of the original function:\\n\\n\u222b (cos(sinh(x)) + x) dx = sin(sinh(x)) + (1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into this expression:\\n\\nsin(sinh(4)) + (1/2)(4^2)\\n\\nBefore rounding down to the nearest integer, we would calculate this value.

Since we're adding 8 to sin(sinh(4)), the integer part of sin(sinh(4)) will not affect the rounding of the sum.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8\\n\\n(Note: If you were to calculate sin(sinh(4)) and it had a fractional part, it would not affect the rounding down of the sum, which is already an integer.)\""}]
