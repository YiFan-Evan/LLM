Integration by parts is based on the product rule for differentiation, and the formula for it is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nFirst, we need to decide which part of the function to differentiate (dv) and which part to integrate (u). Since both sinh(x) and cos(x) are differentiable and integrable, we have a choice. However, it's often simplest to choose the part that becomes simpler when differentiated as our dv.\\n\\nLet's choose:\\nu = sinh(x)\\ndv = cos(x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to find du and v:\\ndu = cosh(x) dx (since the derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x))\\nv = \u222b cos(x) dx = sin(x) (since the integral of cos(x) is sin(x))\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx = sinh(x)sin(x) - \u222bsin(x)cosh(x) dx\\n\\nWe have another integral of sinh(x)cos(x), but this time it's with the opposite sign. This is not helpful since we're not making any progress. Instead, let's recognize that sinh(x)cos(x) is the derivative of (1/2)sinh(2x) because of the double angle formula for hyperbolic sine:\\n\\nsinh(2x) = 2sinh(x)cos(x)\\n\\nThus, the integral of sinh(x)cos(x) is simply (1/2)sinh(2x) plus the constant of integration C. Now let's substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n(1/2)sinh(2*4) = (1/2)sinh(8)\\n\\nNow, we need to calculate sinh(8) and then multiply by 1/2. sinh(8) is not an easy number to calculate by hand, but we can use the identity that connects sinh and cosh functions:\\n\\nsinh^2(x) + cosh^2(x) = 1\\n\\nWe can't directly find sinh(8) from this, but we can calculate it using a calculator or software. Assuming we can calculate sinh(8), we then multiply by 1/2 and round down to the nearest integer to get our result.\\n\\nSince I can't perform the calculation directly here, let's proceed with the theoretical steps:\\n\\n(1/2)sinh(8) = 1/2 * sinh(8)\\n\\nLet's call the value of sinh(8) 'A'. Then our expression becomes:\\n\\n1/2 * A\\n\\nNow, we round down to the nearest integer. Since we don't have the exact value of 'A', let's assume we've calculated it and proceed with the rounding down process:\\n\\nIf A is, for example, 7.9, then 1/2 * A would be 3.95, and rounding down would give us 3. If A is, for example, 8.1, then 1/2 * A would be 4.05, and rounding down would still give us 4.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The integer result of (1/2)sinh(8) after rounding down]\\n\\nSince I don't have the exact value of sinh(8), I can't provide the exact integer result.

We'll start with the sinh(x)*cos(x) term using integration by parts, as described previously. For the x term, the integral is straightforward.\\n\\nLet's start with the sinh(x)*cos(x) term:\\n\\n1. \u222bsinh(x)cos(x) dx\\n\\nWe already know from the previous explanation that this integral is (1/2)sinh(2x) + C1, where C1 is the constant of integration for this part.\\n\\nNow let's integrate the x term:\\n\\n2. \u222bx dx\\n\\nThe integral of x with respect to x is (1/2)x^2 + C2, where C2 is the constant of integration for this part.\\n\\nCombining both parts, the indefinite integral of f(x) is:\\n\\n\u222b[sinh(x)*cos(x) + x] dx = (1/2)sinh(2x) + (1/2)x^2 + C, where C is the sum of C1 and C2.\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result and round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\n(1/2)sinh(2*4) + (1/2)*4^2\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\n(1/2)sinh(8) + 8\\n\\nSince we don't have the exact value of sinh(8), we'll proceed as before and call it 'A'.
