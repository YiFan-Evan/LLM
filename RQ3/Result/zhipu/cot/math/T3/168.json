Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions and is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nWe need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral is simpler than the original one. For this function, we can choose:\\n\\nu = ln(x) because its derivative is less complex,\\ndv = e^(-x) dx because its antiderivative is simple.\\n\\nNow we find du and v:\\n\\ndu = 1/x dx,\\nv = \u222b e^(-x) dx = -e^(-x) (since the integral of e^(-x) is -e^(-x)).\\n\\nNow applying the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) * e^(-x) dx = ln(x) * (-e^(-x)) - \u222b (-e^(-x)) * (1/x) dx\\n= -ln(x) * e^(-x) + \u222b e^(-x) / x dx\\n\\nThe integral \u222b e^(-x) / x dx is a special function called the exponential integral Ei(x), which cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, since we are only interested in the value of the integral at x=4, we can use numerical methods to approximate this integral if necessary.

This means we can integrate the sum of two functions by integrating each function individually and then adding the results.\\n\\nLet's start with the first term, ln(x)/e^x. We've already discussed that this term does not have an elementary antiderivative, so we'll leave it as is for now and focus on the second term, x.\\n\\nThe integral of x with respect to x is straightforward:\\n\\n\u222b x dx = (1/2)x^2 + C1\\n\\nNow, we'll combine this with the integral of the first term, which we'll leave as an expression since it doesn't have an elementary antiderivative:\\n\\n\u222b (ln(x)/e^x + x) dx = \u222b ln(x)/e^x dx + \u222b x dx\\n= \u222b ln(x)/e^x dx + (1/2)x^2 + C1\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the expression we have for the indefinite integral:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x)/e^x dx + (1/2)x^2 + C1 evaluated at x = 4 is:\\n\\n\u222b ln(4)/e^4 dx + (1/2)(4)^2 + C1\\n= \u222b ln(4)/e^4 dx + 8 + C1\\n\\nAgain, we don't need the constant C1 for the final answer. The term \u222b ln(4)/e^4 dx is a constant value, and since we're interested in the integer part of the result, we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer result by rounding down.\\n\\nSo we are left with:\\n\\n8 + (the constant term from the first integral)\\n\\nSince the constant term from the first integral is a real number and we are rounding down to the nearest integer, it won't affect the integer part of the result. Therefore, the integer part of the result is simply 8.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8\""}]
