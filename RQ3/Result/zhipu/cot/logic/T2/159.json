There is no direct connection, but we can use premises (14) and (8) to say that dumpuses are vumpuses and vumpuses are rompuses, but this doesn't help us link wumpuses to vumpuses.\\n- Instead, we can use premise (14) to say that dumpuses are vumpuses, and then premise (9) to say that dumpuses are jompuses, and then premise (1) to say that every jompus is fast, but this also doesn't help us with the connection we need.\\n- Let's try another approach. We know from premise (16) that Rex is a gorpus. From premise (10), we know that every gorpus is a sterpus. However, we don't need to go through the category of sterpus.\\n- Instead, we should use premise (7) which tells us that gorpuses are transparent. Transparency doesn't help us directly, but it's a characteristic of gorpuses, which Rex is.\\n- The key connection we are missing is how being a grimpus relates to being a vumpus. Unfortunately, there is no direct premise that makes this connection. However, we can use premises (14) and (9) to connect dumpuses to jompuses, and then use premise (1) to say that every jompus is fast. This is still not leading us to the conclusion that Rex is dull.\\n- Let's go back to the fact that Rex is a gorpus (premise 16) and use premise (15) that Rex is a grimpus. We need a connection between gorpuses and vumpuses. We don't have a direct connection, but we can use premise (2) that gorpuses are dumpuses and then premise (14) that dumpuses are vumpuses.\\n- Now we have connected Rex (a gorpus) to dumpuses, and dumpuses to vumpuses.
