However, we don't have direct information that links a brimpus or zumpus to a tumpus. \\n\\nWe need to find a connection between yumpus and numpus. We notice that premise (4) states that everything that is a yumpus is either wooden or luminous or a sterpus. Then, premise (8) tells us that everything that is a sterpus is either muffled, melodic, or a wumpus. But premise (9) tells us that everything that is a wumpus is either dull or bright or a dumpus, and there is no direct connection here to numpus.\\n\\nWe need to go back to premise (10), which tells us that everything that is a yumpus is either nervous, shy, or a vumpus.

We don't need to use lorpus in our proof, but this tells us that premise (6) can be connected to premise (11).\\n\\nGiven that Max is a yumpus (premise 13), we can use premise (10) to deduce that Max is either nervous, shy, or a vumpus. Then, using premise (7), we can deduce that Max is either small, large, or a lempus. But we are interested in connecting Max to a numpus, so we look for a premise that connects yumpus to numpus directly.\\n\\nPremise (6) states that everything that is a numpus is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus. However, we don't have a direct premise that says Max is a numpus. But since Max is a yumpus and premise (10) implies that a yumpus can also be a vumpus, and premise (7) implies that a vumpus can be connected to a numpus through the properties of being small, large, or a lempus, we can indirectly deduce that if Max is a yumpus, then Max must be connected to the properties of being a numpus.\\n\\nTherefore, we can conclude that Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus based on the connection between yumpus and numpus through vumpus.
