However, from (9), we know that jompuses are yumpuses, and since Max is a jompus (13), this seems to create a contradiction. But we need to show that Max cannot be an impus.\\n\\nTo do this, we need to use the information about vumpuses. From (10), we know that numpuses are vumpuses, and since Max is a numpus (14), Max is also a vumpus. Now, we need to find a premise that relates vumpuses to impuses to create a contradiction.\\n\\nPremise (3) states that everything that is a zumpus and a wumpus and a gorpus is a vumpus.

But since Max is a vumpus, and premise (10) does not state that vumpuses are grimpuses, we do not have a direct contradiction here.\\n\\nHowever, we do not need to prove that Max is a grimpus to show that Max is not an impus. Instead, we can use premise (12), which states that everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a yumpus. Since Max is a zumpus, a tumpus, and if Max were an impus, then Max would be a yumpus.
