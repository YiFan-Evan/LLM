From premise (4), we know that every zumpus is a grimpus, which implies that a zumpus is both a yumpus and a grimpus. Since Fae is a zumpus, it must also be a yumpus by (4).\\n\\nFrom premise (5), we know that every yumpus is a gorpus and an impus. Since Fae is a yumpus (from the fact that it is a zumpus, and every zumpus is a yumpus by (4)), Fae must also be a gorpus and an impus.\\n\\nNow we need to show that Fae is a sterpus. From premise (1), we know that each sterpus is a brimpus and a jompus, but this doesn't directly help us with Fae's status as a sterpus. However, premise (6) states that dumpuses are zumpuses.

Since Fae is a vumpus and premise (7) says numpuses are vumpuses, we can infer that Fae could be a numpus, but this doesn't help us with Fae being a sterpus or a rompus.\\n\\nThe key connection comes from premise (9) again, which says Fae is a zumpus and a yumpus. Since we have already established that Fae is a yumpus, we need to connect this back to a grimpus. We do this by using premise (4) which says that every zumpus is a grimpus. Since Fae is a zumpus, it must also be a grimpus by (4).\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to derive that Fae is a grimpus is (4) and (9), because (9) establishes that Fae is a zumpus, and (4) establishes that every zumpus is a grimpus.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (4),(9)->(11)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Fae is a vumpus and a tumpus.
