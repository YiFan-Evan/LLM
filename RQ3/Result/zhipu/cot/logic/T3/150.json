Since she is a yumpus, and from (2) we know that each zumpus is also a yumpus, we can infer that if Stella is a yumpus, she could potentially be a zumpus. However, this is not enough to conclude that she is a vumpus, as we do not have information that all yumpuses are vumpuses.\\n\\nHowever, we do not need to establish that Stella is a vumpus to prove that Taylor is a visionary. We can use a direct proof from (1) and (10). Since Stella is a grimpus, and we do not have any information that would suggest that being a grimpus has any direct relation to being a vumpus, we cannot use that to infer anything about Taylor's visionary status.\\n\\nThe crucial point is that we do not need to establish that Stella is a vumpus to use premise (1). If we assume for the sake of argument that Stella is a vumpus (which would make the antecedent of the conditional in premise (1) true), then the consequent would also be true, meaning Taylor would be a visionary. Since the conditional statement in (1) does not say that Taylor is only a visionary if Stella is a vumpus, but rather that if Stella is a vumpus, then Taylor is a visionary, the truth of the consequent does not depend on the truth of the antecedent. Therefore, Taylor is a visionary regardless of whether Stella is a vumpus.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1)->(12) \\n\\nHowever, since we are looking for the minimal set of premises that lead to the proof obligation, and premise (1) alone is sufficient to derive (12), we do not need to list any other premises. The correct answer in the required format is:\\n\\n(1)->(12)\""}]
