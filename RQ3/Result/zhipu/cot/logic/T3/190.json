Therefore, every rompus is also a gorpus.\\n- From (20), Each grimpus is a rompus. Therefore, grimpuses are also gorpuses.\\n- From (14), Every vumpus is wooden. Since vumpuses are tumpuses (19), and Stella is a brimpus (which leads to being a numpus and doesn't contradict being a vumpus), we can say that Stella could potentially be wooden, but this doesn't help with transparency.\\n- From (6), Rompuses are sterpuses.

Since every dumpus is a gorpus and every gorpus could be a rompus (which is a sterpus), we are still not getting to transparency.\\n- From (9), Zumpuses are large. This is a property of zumpuses but doesn't connect to transparency.\\n- From (10), Rompuses are transparent. Since each grimpus is a rompus (20) and Stella is a brimpus, we need to connect Stella to being a rompus.\\n- From (21), Vumpuses are grimpuses. Since Stella could potentially be a vumpus (due to being a brimpus and not contradicting the premise that vumpuses are tumpuses), she could also be a grimpus.\\n- From (20), Each grimpus is a rompus.
