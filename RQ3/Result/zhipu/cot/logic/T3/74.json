Let's start from the statement we need to prove and work backwards:\\n\\n(11) Alex is a tumpus.\\n\\nWe know from premise (10) that Alex is a rompus, and from premise (7) that each rompus is a sterpus. To connect Alex to being a tumpus, we need to show that sterpus implies tumpus. However, there is no direct statement that sterpus implies tumpus, so we need to find another chain that connects sterpus to tumpus.\\n\\nFrom premise (2), we know that each sterpus is a brimpus, and from premise (1), we know that brimpuses are yumpuses and grimpuses. There is no direct connection between brimpus and tumpus, so we need to continue looking for connections.\\n\\nPremise (8) tells us that each tumpus is a shumpus and a vumpus. This gives us a connection from tumpus to vumpus. Now, we need to connect vumpus to something we know about Alex.\\n\\nFrom premise (9), we know Alex is a lempus and a dumpus, and from premise (5), we know each vumpus is a dumpus and a lempus. This gives us a connection between Alex and vumpus.\\n\\nSo the chain we are looking for involves connecting Alex to vumpus through lempus and dumpus, and then connecting vumpus to tumpus.
