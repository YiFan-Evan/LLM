Since Rex is a numpus, we can infer that Rex is a tumpus from (5).

However, we can use (1), which states that everything that is fruity or a numpus is a zumpus. Since Rex is a numpus, he is also a zumpus.\\n\\nNow, we need to find a way to connect \\\"zumpus\\\" to \\\"temperate\\\" or \\\"tumpus.\\\" There is no direct connection, but we can use (7), which tells us that everything that is transparent or a brimpus is a numpus. Since Rex is a numpus, he could also be a brimpus (if he is transparent). Then, using (4), we know that everything that is liquid or a brimpus is a vumpus. However, this does not help us with \\\"temperate\\\" or \\\"tumpus.\\\"\\n\\nWe need to find an intermediate step that will allow us to use \\\"temperate\\\" in our proof. Looking at the premises, we see that (2) states that everything that is temperate or a tumpus is a grimpus. If we can show that Rex is a grimpus, then we can use (2) to say that Rex is temperate or a tumpus.\\n\\nTo show that Rex is a grimpus, we can use (6), which states that everything that is discordant or a grimpus is a yumpus. We don't have information about whether Rex is discordant, but we can use (9), which states that everything that is aggressive or a grimpus is a lorpus. Again, we don't know if Rex is aggressive, but we can use (8), which states that everything that is feisty or a tumpus is a lempus. Now, if Rex is a tumpus, he could also be a lempus.\\n\\nWe already established that Rex is a tumpus from (5) because he is a numpus. Therefore, we can use (8) to say that Rex is a lempus. Now, we need to connect \\\"lempus\\\" to \\\"grimpus.\\\" Unfortunately, there is no direct connection for \\\"lempus\\\" in the premises. However, we can use (2) in reverse: if Rex is a grimpus, then he must be temperate or a tumpus.\\n\\nWe have a loop where we need to prove that Rex is a grimpus to use (2), but we don't have a direct way to prove that Rex is a grimpus. We need to find a connection that allows us to use (2) without directly proving that Rex is a grimpus.\\n\\nLooking back at the premises, we notice that (11) tells us that Rex is a gorpus. Using (3), we know that everything that is rainy or a gorpus is a jompus. Since Rex is a gorpus, he is also a jompus.
