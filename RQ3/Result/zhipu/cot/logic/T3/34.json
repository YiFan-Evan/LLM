Since these are inclusive or statements, we can use any one of the options to proceed with the proof.\\n\\nFirst, let's consider the case where Sam is a jompus. According to (5), every jompus is a vumpus. Since (8) states that tumpuses are vumpuses, and (9) states that each tumpus is a wumpus, we can infer that vumpuses are a subset of wumpuses. Therefore, if Sam is a jompus, Sam is also a wumpus.\\n\\nNext, let's consider the case where Sam is an impus. Premise (6) tells us that impuses are vumpuses, and following the same reasoning as above, we can conclude that if Sam is an impus, Sam is also a wumpus.\\n\\nLastly, if Sam is a lorpus, according to (2), every lorpus is a wumpus, so Sam would also be a wumpus in this case.\\n\\nSince we have covered all possibilities for Sam being a jompus, impus, or lorpus, and in each case, we conclude that Sam is a wumpus, we can derive the proof obligation (13) from these premises.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (11),(2),(5),(8),(9)->(13) or (11),(6),(8),(9)->(13) or (12),(2)->(13).
