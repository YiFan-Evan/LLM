From the premises, we know that Max is a brimpus (12) and a yumpus (13). We need to use these facts to reach the conclusion.\\n\\nFirst, we need to find a premise that connects brimpus to vumpus or one of the properties of earthy or fruity. We don't have a direct connection, so we look for another premise that might help us make a connection. Premise (2) tells us that everything that is a brimpus is also a zumpus. This doesn't help us directly, but it's a step in identifying what a brimpus is.\\n\\nNext, we look for a connection between yumpus and vumpus or the properties of earthy or fruity. Premise (3) tells us that everything that is a yumpus is a grimpus, which doesn't help with the desired conclusion either. However, premise (6) tells us that everything that is a numpus is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus. We need to connect Max to being a numpus.\\n\\nTo connect Max to being a numpus, we look for a premise that connects yumpus to numpus. We don't have a direct connection for that, but premise (10) tells us that everything that is a yumpus is also a vumpus. Now, if we can connect vumpus to numpus, we can use premise (6) to conclude that Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus.\\n\\nPremise (4) tells us that everything that is a yumpus (which Max is) is also a yumpus, which is not helpful, but premise (7) tells us that everything that is a vumpus is a lempus. We still don't have a direct connection between vumpus and numpus. However, premise (5) tells us that everything that is a sterpus is hot, cold, or a shumpus. This doesn't help us with the connection we need either.\\n\\nWe realize that we haven't used premise (8), which tells us that everything that is a sterpus is a sterpus. This is not helpful by itself, but we also haven't used premise (11), which tells us that everything that is a numpus is slow, fast, or a lorpus. This doesn't directly help with our proof either.\\n\\nFinally, we notice that premise (9) tells us that everything that is a wumpus is dull, bright, or a dumpus, which doesn't help with the proof obligation. However, we have overlooked that premise (6) connects numpus to earthy, fruity, or a vumpus, and we have a connection between yumpus and vumpus from premise (10).\\n\\nTherefore, we can conclude that Max, being a yumpus (13), is also a vumpus (from premise 10). Since everything that is a vumpus is also a numpus (from premise 6), and everything that is a numpus is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus, we have found our proof.\\n\\nSo, the minimal set of premises we need to derive the proof obligation (14) is:\\n\\n(6), (10), (13) -> (14)\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (6),(10),(13)->(14)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Max is earthy, fruity, or a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
