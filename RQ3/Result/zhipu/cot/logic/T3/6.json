Let's find the relevant propositions that can help us derive this conclusion:\\n\\n1. We need to connect Fae with jompuses since we have a premise that every jompus is not large (premise 1).\\n2. From premise 20, we know that every jompus is a lorpus.\\n3. To connect Fae with jompuses, we need to use premise 24, which tells us that Fae is a brimpus.\\n4. From premise 19, we learn that every brimpus is a zumpus.\\n5. We don't have any direct connection between zumpus and jompus, so we need to look for other connections. From premise 4, we know that jompuses are gorpuses.\\n6. We also need to establish a connection between Fae and gorpuses. From premise 23, we know that Fae is a sterpus.\\n7. To connect sterpus with gorpus, we use premise 12, which tells us that every sterpus is a tumpus.\\n8. We need to connect tumpus with gorpus. From premise 17, we learn that gorpuses are wumpuses.\\n9. We don't have a direct connection between wumpus and tumpus, but from premise 7, we know that every gorpus is a dumpus, and since gorpuses are wumpuses (premise 17), this means that every dumpus is also a wumpus.\\n10. To connect dumpus with tumpus, we use premise 18, which tells us that tumpuses are orange. This doesn't help us with size, but it's part of establishing the chain from Fae to jompus.\\n11. We need to find a connection between dumpus and jompus. From premise 10, we know that vumpuses are jompuses.\\n12. To connect vumpus with dumpus, we use premise 9, which tells us that every vumpus is not transparent. This doesn't directly connect dumpus and vumpus, but we need to establish a chain of connections.\\n13. We can connect vumpus with gorpus using premise 14, which tells us that each vumpus is a lempus.\\n14. To connect lempus with gorpus, we use premise 11, which tells us that lempuses are rainy. This doesn't directly connect lempus and gorpus, but we are building a chain.\\n15. We need to connect lempus with dumpus. From premise 15, we learn that sterpuses are yumpuses.\\n16. To connect yumpus with lempus, we use premise 8, which tells us that yumpuses are impuses.\\n17. To connect impus with lempus, we use premise 6, which tells us that impuses are not aggressive. This doesn't directly connect impus and lempus, but it's part of the chain.\\n18. We can connect impus with vumpus using premise 2, which tells us that yumpuses are vumpuses.\\n19.
