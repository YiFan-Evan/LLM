However, we need to show that Sally is brown or a vumpus, not just that she is a vumpus.\\n\\nLet's start with the fact that Sally is a brimpus (premise 10). We then look for a premise that connects being a brimpus with being brown or a vumpus. We can use premise (9) which states that everything that is opaque or a brimpus is a zumpus. But we need to get to brown or vumpus, not zumpus.\\n\\nWe can't directly connect a brimpus to brown, so we need to find an indirect connection. Looking at premise (6), we see that everything that is brown or a vumpus is a shumpus. This doesn't help us with a direct connection either, but premise (5) tells us that everything that is rainy or a brimpus is a vumpus. Since Sally is a brimpus, she must also be a vumpus by this premise.\\n\\nNow we have that Sally is a vumpus. According to premise (2), everything that is large or a wumpus is a dumpus, but this doesn't help with our proof obligation. However, we don't need to use this premise because we already have that Sally is a vumpus from premise (5) connected with premise (10).\\n\\nSince Sally is a vumpus, and premise (6) says that everything that is brown or a vumpus is a shumpus, we can conclude that Sally must be either brown or a vumpus, because she satisfies the 'or' condition of the premise (by being a vumpus).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (5),(10)->(12)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is brown or a vumpus then Taylor is a visionary.
