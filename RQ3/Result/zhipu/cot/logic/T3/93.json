From premise (6), we know Alex is a jompus. Therefore, by modus ponens, we can conclude that Alex is a grimpus.\\n\\nHowever, we also need to consider the possibility that Alex is discordant. For this, we need to look at premises that might allow us to derive discordancy from Alex's properties.\\n\\nPremise (5) states that if something is discordant or a grimpus, it is a gorpus. But this doesn't help us prove that Alex is discordant; it only tells us the result if Alex were discordant or a grimpus.\\n\\nWe don't have a direct premise that connects Alex's properties (jompus or vumpus) to being discordant. However, if we assume that Alex is not a grimpus (from premise (1)), we can use premise (7) to deduce that Alex must be cold (since Alex is a vumpus and everything that is cold or a vumpus is a yumpus). But this still doesn't lead us to conclude that Alex is discordant.\\n\\nSince we can't derive that Alex is discordant directly from the premises, and we've already established that Alex could be a grimpus from being a jompus, the proof obligation can be met by showing that Alex is either discordant or a grimpus. We have already shown that Alex could be a grimpus. We don't have enough information to prove that Alex is discordant, but we don't need to; the proof obligation only requires \\\"or.\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises to derive the proof obligation is (1), (6), and (7), because these premises allow us to conclude that Alex is a grimpus, which fulfills the \\\"or a grimpus\\\" part of the proof obligation.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(6),(7)->(8)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Alex is discordant or a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.
