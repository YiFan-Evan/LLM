According to premise (2), every wumpus is a lempus, a gorpus, and an impus. Since Rex is a vumpus (premise 15), if he were a lempus, he would also be a gorpus and an impus.\\n\\nHowever, we can use premises (4) and (12) to show that Rex is a sterpus and therefore an impus (since each sterpus is an impus). This means that if Rex were a lempus, he would have to be a gorpus as well.\\n\\nPremise (3) states that each gorpus is a rompus. If Rex were a gorpus, he would also be a rompus. But we can use premises (7) and (15) to show that since Rex is a vumpus, he would also be a rompus if he were a lempus (because each lempus is a rompus).\\n\\nNow, we need to show that Rex cannot be a gorpus. We can do this by showing that Rex does not satisfy the condition of being a gorpus. Since Rex is a dumpus (premises 10 and 17), and we have not been given any premise that states that all dumpuses are gorpuses or that all gorpuses are dumpuses, we cannot directly conclude that Rex is a gorpus from these premises.\\n\\nHowever, we can use premises (2) and (11) to show that if Rex were a lempus, he would be a wumpus, and since wumpuses are tumpuses (premise 5), Rex would also be a tumpus if he were a lempus. But premise (9) states that everything that is a lorpus and a vumpus and a dumpus is a tumpus. Since Rex is a lorpus (premise 1), a vumpus (premise 15), and a dumpus (premises 10 and 17), he is a tumpus. But this does not necessarily mean that Rex is a lempus, as we have not established that he is a gorpus.\\n\\nTherefore, we need to find a contradiction that would prove Rex cannot be a lempus. We can use the following premises:\\n\\n- (2) Every wumpus is a lempus and a gorpus and an impus.\\n- (3) Each gorpus is a rompus.\\n- (7) Each lempus is a rompus.\\n- (15) Rex is a vumpus.\\n- (16) Each lempus is a dumpus.\\n- (17) Rex is a dumpus.\\n\\nFrom these premises, we can deduce that if Rex were a lempus, he would be a gorpus (since he's a vumpus) and therefore a rompus (since every gorpus is a rompus). But we have not been given any premise that allows us to conclude that Rex is a rompus directly from being a dumpus. Thus, there is no contradiction from the given premises that directly proves Rex is not a lempus.\\n\\nHowever, since we are asked to provide the minimal set of premises that can derive the proof obligation, and we have not found a direct contradiction, we must consider that the proof may not be possible with the given premises. Nevertheless, we have used the relevant premises to attempt the proof.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(3),(7),(15),(16),(17)->(21) \\n\\nThis represents the attempt to prove that Rex is not a lempus using the given premises, but it does not necessarily mean the proof is valid without an explicit contradiction or further logical steps that we cannot derive from the given information.\""}]
