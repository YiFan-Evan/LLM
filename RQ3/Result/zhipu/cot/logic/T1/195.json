Since we have established that Sam is a dumpus, and we have no information that dumpuses are bitter (and we don't need any, since we're proving Sam is not bitter, not that dumpuses are not bitter), we can use the contrapositive of the statement \\\"numpuses are not bitter\\\" to infer that if Sam were a numpus, he would not be bitter.\\n\\nThe contrapositive is not directly provided, but we can infer it: If all numpuses are not bitter, then anything that is not a numpus might be bitter (this is not a logical certainty but a gap in our premises).
