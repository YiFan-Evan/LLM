We can start from the definition of what a gorpus is, as stated in premise (3): Every gorpus is a yumpus and a wumpus. We need to show that Sally is a yumpus and a wumpus.\\n\\nFrom premise (9), we know that Sally is a jompus and a sterpus. Since we need to establish that Sally is a yumpus, we look for premises that connect jompuses or sterpuses to yumpuses.Premise (1) tells us that yumpuses are sterpuses and jompuses, which implies that if Sally is a sterpus, she could be a yumpus, and if she is a jompus, she could also be a yumpus. We do not need to establish both conditions separately because one is sufficient.\\n\\nNow we need to show that Sally is a wumpus. From premise (10), we know that Sally is a vumpus and a rompus. We need to find a connection between vumpuses or rompuses and wumpuses. Premise (6) states that vumpuses are grimpuses and lorpuses, but this doesn't help us with wumpuses. However, premise (7) tells us that rompuses are vumpuses and gorpuses, which means if Sally is a rompus, she could be a gorpus. But we need a direct connection to wumpuses. For that, we look at premise (2), which tells us that each impus is a rompus and a tumpus. Since Sally is a vumpus, and if vumpuses are related to impuses (which isn't directly stated but can be inferred from the chain of relationships), then Sally being a vumpus could imply she is an impus. \\n\\nPremise (5) states that each zumpus is an impus, but we have no information about Sally being a zumpus. However, premise (2) can be used to say that if Sally is an impus, she is also a tumpus. Then, premise (8) tells us that each tumpus is a brimpus and a shumpus. Although this doesn't give us a wumpus, it doesn't contradict any of the information we have so far.\\n\\nWe need to establish a connection between tumpuses and wumpuses. Unfortunately, none of the premises provide a direct link between tumpuses and wumpuses. However, we can use premise (7) again, which tells us that rompuses are vumpuses and gorpuses. Since Sally is a rompus (from premise 10), and rompuses are gorpuses, Sally is a gorpus.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to derive that Sally is a gorpus is (3), (9), and (10), because we establish that Sally is a yumpus from (9) and (1), and that she is a gorpus from (10) and (7).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(9),(10)->(11)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
