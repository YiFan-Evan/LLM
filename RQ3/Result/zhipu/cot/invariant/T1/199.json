Selection sort works by iteratively selecting the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, which is indexed by `t`, the loop invariant should express that the subarray `arr[0:t]` is sorted after `t` iterations. However, the format you've specified requires us to express it as 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.\\n\\nLet's analyze the loop:\\n\\nBefore the first iteration of the outer loop, `t` is 0, and no elements have been sorted, so the invariant does not need to hold yet.\\n\\nAt the beginning of each iteration `i` of the outer loop (where `i` ranges from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`), the subarray `arr[0:i]` should be sorted. This means that the minimum of `arr[0:i]` is at position `arr[i-1]` (if `i > 0`), and all elements before `i` are in their correct sorted positions.\\n\\nAt the end of each iteration `i` of the outer loop, we have moved the smallest element of the unsorted subarray `arr[i:end]` to the beginning of the unsorted subarray, ensuring that `arr[0:i+1]` is sorted.\\n\\nSince the format requires a statement in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', let's express the invariant in this way:\\n\\n- Before the `i-th` iteration (`i >= 0`), `min_value = min(arr[0:i])->arr[i-1]` holds true, because `arr[0:i]` is sorted.\\n- After the `i-th` iteration, the invariant changes to `min_value = min(arr[0:i+1])->arr[i]`, because we have just moved the smallest element from the unsorted part to the `i-th` position.\\n\\nHowever, the format does not accommodate the change from before to after the iteration, and since the invariant must hold at the start of each iteration, we will use the pre-condition form:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`min_value = min(arr[0:t])->arr[t-1]` for each `t` from 1 to `len(arr) - 1`.
