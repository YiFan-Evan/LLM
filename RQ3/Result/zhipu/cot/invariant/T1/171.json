The inner while loop shifts elements to the right to make room for the current element `arr[i]` to be placed in its correct position.\\n\\nLet's consider the loop invariant for the outer loop.

Now, let's write this in the specified format:\\n\\n`arr[0...i].sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nSince the format requires us to use `->` and imply a function, we can interpret `sorted` as the operation that maintains the sorted order of the subarray.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0...i].sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nHowever, note that there is a mistake in the provided code.

There is indeed an error in the provided code snippet where `i` is used instead of `l`. Let's correct the variable and provide a loop invariant for the corrected `insertion_sort` function.\\n\\nThe corrected code should use `l` as the loop variable for the outer while loop. The purpose of the insertion sort algorithm is to sort the array `arr` in ascending order. At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray from index `0` to `l-1` is already sorted. The variable `l` represents the index at which the next element should be correctly inserted into the sorted portion of the array.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the outer loop (with `i` being 0-indexed), the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n`arr[0...l-1].sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[l-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the subarray from index `0` to `l-1` is sorted before the `l`-th element is considered.\\n\\nNow, let's express this in the specified format:\\n\\n`arr[0...l-1].sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[l-1])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0...l-1].sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[l-1])`\\n\\nThis loop invariant holds true before the `l`-th iteration starts, ensuring that each iteration of the outer loop maintains the sorted order of the growing subarray as the algorithm progresses.\""}]
