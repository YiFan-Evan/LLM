[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of this function is to calculate the sum of all elements in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the sum of the elements from the start of the array up to the current index `c`. Before the loop starts, `c` is 0, and `sum_value` should represent the sum of elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[0]`, which is just `arr[0]`. As the loop progresses, `sum_value` accumulates the sum of elements up to the current index `c`.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop (where `i` ranges from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`) can be stated as:\\n\\n`sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[c])`\\n\\nAt the beginning of the loop (`c = 0`), this invariant states that `sum_value` is the sum of the first element.
