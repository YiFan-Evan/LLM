[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

At the i-th iteration, `o` is equal to `i`, and `last_value` should hold the value of the last element of the subarray `arr[0:i]`.\\n\\nHowever, since the function's goal is to find the last element of the entire array, and the loop updates `last_value` to the current element at each step, the loop invariant should reflect that `last_value` will be the last element of the array after the loop finishes, but at each iteration, it represents the last element encountered so far.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`last_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[o])` for the i-th iteration, where `o` is the loop control variable and `fun` is a function that returns the last element of the subarray from index `0` to the current index `o`. Since `o` is the index and not the number of elements, the subarray size is `o + 1` elements.\\n\\nSo the loop invariant is:\\n`last_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[o])` for the i-th iteration, where `o` is the index of the current element being considered as the potential last element encountered so far.\""}]
