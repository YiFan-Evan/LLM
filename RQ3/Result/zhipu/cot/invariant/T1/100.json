The purpose of the function is to find the value of the element at index `id` in the array `arr`. \\n\\nThe loop invariant should express that the `member_value` either remains the same if the current index `a` does not match the `id`, or it gets assigned the value from the array at index `a` if `a` matches `id`. However, since the `member_value` is only supposed to be updated once when `a` equals `id`, we should capture that it will remain unchanged after that point as well.\\n\\nAt the start of the loop (`a = 0`), the invariant could be:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[a])` where `fun` is a function that returns `-1` if its input index is not equal to `id`, and returns `arr[id]` if its input index is equal to `id`.\\n\\nHowever, since the `member_value` is initialized to `-1` and is only changed when `a` is equal to `id`, we can simplify the invariant to:\\n\\nBefore the i-th iteration (where `i` starts at 0 and goes up to `len(arr)`):\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nDuring the i-th iteration:\\n- If `i-1` is not equal to `id`, then `member_value` remains the same as before the iteration (`member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`).\\n- If `i-1` is equal to `id`, then `member_value` is updated to `arr[id]` (`member_value = arr[id]`), and the invariant changes to `member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`.\\n\\nAfter the loop, the invariant should reflect that `member_value` has the value of `arr[id]` if `id` is a valid index, or `-1` if it's not:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[len(arr)])`\\n\\nGiven that the loop does not change the value of `member_value` after it has been set to the value of `arr[id]`, we can simplify the invariant to reflect the final state after the loop:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[id])` if `id` is within the bounds of `arr`, otherwise `member_value = -1`. \\n\\nHowever, since the format you've asked for requires the invariant to be in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we can't directly express the condition for `id` being out of bounds. We'll assume that the user ensures `id` is within bounds, so the invariant will be:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[id])` \\n\\nThis invariant holds before the loop starts and after each iteration until `a` equals `id`.
