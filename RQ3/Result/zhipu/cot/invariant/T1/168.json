The goal of insertion sort is to sort an array by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted part and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part.\\n\\nThe outer loop iterates over each element of the array, and the inner loop shifts elements greater than the current element to the right to make room for inserting the current element in its correct position.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, let's denote `i` as the index of the current element to be inserted into the sorted portion of the array. Before the inner loop starts, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted. As we perform the inner loop, we ensure that `arr[0:i+1]` will also be sorted.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\nAfter the i-th iteration of the inner loop (but before the i-th iteration of the outer loop increments `i`), the property `arr[0:i+1]` is sorted for the i-th element. However, the format you have specified requires us to express this as `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`. To comply with this, we can say that the value of the subarray ending at the current index is the result of a function that keeps the order of elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i]` sorted:\\n\\n`arr[0:i+1]_value = sorted(arr[0:i+1]->arr[0:i+1])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0:i+1]_value = sorted(arr[0:i+1]->arr[0:i+1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be described by focusing on the subarray that is affected by the inner loop. The inner loop ensures that after each iteration, the element at index `i` is placed in its correct position within the sorted subarray `arr[0:i]`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the property that holds true before the inner loop starts and after it ends for each iteration. Specifically, after the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the elements from the start of the array up to the current index `i` (inclusive) should be in a sorted order. The loop invariant should state that the subarray from index `0` to `i` is sorted after each inner loop execution.\\n\\nTo comply with the specified format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, we can express the loop invariant as follows:\\n\\n`arr[0:i+1]_value = sorted(arr[0:i+1]->arr[0:i+1])`\\n\\nHowever, since we are looking for the i-th iteration of the inner loop, we need to specify the invariant just before the inner loop starts for that iteration. At that point, `arr[0:i]` is already sorted, and we are about to insert `arr[i]` into its correct position. Thus, the loop invariant should reflect that `arr[0:i-1]` is sorted before the inner loop begins its i-th iteration.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0:i]_value = sorted(arr[0:i]->arr[0:i])` for the i-th iteration of the inner loop, just before it starts.\""}]
