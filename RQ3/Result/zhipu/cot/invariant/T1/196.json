The purpose of selection sort is to sort an array in ascending order. It does this by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, which is controlled by the variable `q`, the loop invariant should express that the subarray `arr[0...q-1]` is sorted and is the smallest possible sorted subarray of the original array that could be achieved with `q` elements. \\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `i` ranges from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`), the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`arr[0...i-1]_value = fun(arr[0...i-1]->arr[0...i-1])`\\n\\nHowever, we need to express it in the form you specified, which is `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`. In the first iteration, `q` is 0, so the sorted subarray is empty.
