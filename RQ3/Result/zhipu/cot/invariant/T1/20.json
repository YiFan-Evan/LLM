[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of the loop is to find the minimum value in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop should express the fact that `min_value` holds the minimum value found in the array from the start up to the current index `a`. Before the loop starts, `min_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`, and `a` is initialized to `0`.
