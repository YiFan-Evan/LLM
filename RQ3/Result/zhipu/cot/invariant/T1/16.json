[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of the function is to find the maximum value in the array `arr`. \\n\\nAt the start of the loop, `max_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`, and `q` is initialized to `0`. The loop continues to iterate as long as `q` is less than the length of the array. Inside the loop, if the current element `arr[q]` is greater than the current `max_value`, `max_value` is updated to this new value.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the fact that after each iteration, `max_value` holds the maximum value found in the subarray `arr[0...q-1]`.
