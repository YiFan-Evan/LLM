[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of this function `give_member` is to find the value of the element at index `id` in the array `arr`.\\n\\nBefore the loop starts, `member_value` is initialized to -1, and `q` is initialized to 0. At each iteration, `q` is incremented by 1, and if `q` equals `id`, `member_value` is updated to the value at `arr[q]`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the fact that `member_value` holds the value of the element at index `id` for all indices `q` checked so far, or -1 if `id` has not been found yet.
