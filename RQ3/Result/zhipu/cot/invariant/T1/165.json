This process continues until `arr[z]` is in the correct position or `z` becomes 0.\\n- After each iteration of the inner loop, the elements before `z` are sorted, and `arr[z]` is placed in its correct position within the sorted part.\\n\\nConsidering the above, a suitable loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop (with `f` being the loop variable) could be:\\n\\n- After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted.\\n\\nHowever, since the format specified requires the invariant to be in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we can't directly write it in that format because it's not describing a value or a function of values between two array indices. Instead, we can describe the relationship between elements before and after the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\\n\\nFor the inner loop, we can consider an invariant that describes the relationship between `arr[z]` and the elements before `z`:\\n\\n- `arr[z]_value = min_value(arr[z]->arr[0])` after the z-th iteration of the inner loop, which implies that `arr[z]` has been moved to its correct position in the sorted part of the array.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[z]_value = min_value(arr[z]->arr[0])` for the z-th iteration of the inner loop. \\n\\nPlease note that this invariant is specific to the inner loop and describes the property that holds after each swap operation within the inner loop.

Let's analyze the corrected `insertion_sort` function to provide a loop invariant in the specified format.\\n\\nThe corrected function has a typo in the initialization of the variable `z`. It should be initialized to `f` instead of `i`. Let's assume this typo is fixed and proceed with the analysis.\\n\\nThe purpose of the insertion sort algorithm is to sort an array by inserting each element into its correct position in a subarray that is already sorted. The outer loop variable `f` iterates over the array elements to be placed in the sorted subarray, and the inner loop variable `z` performs the necessary comparisons and swaps to insert the `f`-th element into its correct position.\\n\\nFor the loop invariant, we need a property that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner loop. The inner loop ensures that after each swap, the elements from the start of the array up to `z` are in sorted order. Therefore, a loop invariant for the inner loop could be:\\n\\n- After the i-th iteration of the inner loop, `arr[0:z]` is sorted, where `z` is the current index of the inner loop.\\n\\nTo fit the specified format 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we can express this invariant as a relationship between the values of the array elements before and after the swap. The invariant could be stated as:\\n\\n- `arr[z]_value = fun(arr[z - 1]->arr[z])` after the i-th iteration of the inner loop, which implies that the value at `arr[z]` is the result of a function `fun` applied to the values of `arr[z - 1]` and `arr[z]`.\\n\\nSince the specific function `fun` is not defined, we can consider it as a placeholder for the operation that maintains the sorted order after the swap. Therefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[z]_value = fun(arr[z - 1]->arr[z])` for the i-th iteration of the inner loop, where `fun` is a function that ensures the sorted order of the elements after the swap operation.\""}]
