[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

At the start of the loop (`o = 0`), `min_value` is initialized to the first element of the array.\\n\\nThe loop invariant at the i-th iteration (`o = i`) should state that `min_value` is the minimum value among the elements from the start of the array up to the current index `i`. Therefore, the loop invariant is:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nSince the loop stops when `o` is greater than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`, the final loop invariant when `o` reaches its exit condition should include all elements of the array:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\""}]
