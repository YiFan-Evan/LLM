The purpose of the function is to find the minimum value in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the fact that `min_value` holds the minimum value of the subarray `arr[0:e]` after each iteration of the loop. At the start of the loop, `e` is 0, and `min_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`. Therefore, the invariant should hold true for `e = 0`.\\n\\nConsidering the loop, the invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n- At the start of the i-th iteration (where `i` corresponds to the value of `e`), `min_value` holds the minimum value of the subarray `arr[0:i]`.\\n\\nLet's write this in the specified format:\\n\\n- Before the i-th iteration (when `e` is about to be `i`), `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nAfter each iteration, if `arr[e]` is less than `min_value`, `min_value` is updated to `arr[e]`.

This change ensures that the loop iterates over all elements in the array, including the last one.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for this function should still express that `min_value` holds the minimum value found so far in the array as the loop progresses. The loop invariant should hold true at the beginning of each iteration (before the loop body is executed) and should describe the relationship between `min_value` and the elements of the array that have been examined up to that point.\\n\\nGiven that `e` starts at 0 and increases by 1 with each iteration, at the start of the i-th iteration (`e = i`), `min_value` should contain the minimum value among the first `i` elements of the array.\\n\\nThe loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- Before the i-th iteration (when `e` is about to be `i`), `min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds true for `i = 0` since `min_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`, which is the minimum value of the subarray `arr[0]`. During each iteration, if `arr[e]` is less than `min_value`, `min_value` is updated to `arr[e]`. If not, `min_value` remains the same.
