The outer loop variable `o` represents the current position we are trying to find the minimum element for.

At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the invariant we want to capture is that the elements from the start of the array up to index `o` are sorted, and they are the smallest elements encountered so far in the array.

This change does not affect the logic of the algorithm; it simply ensures that the loop includes the last index of the array.\\n\\nThe loop invariant we are looking for should still describe the property of the array that holds true after each iteration of the outer loop. After each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:o]` (where `o` is the current index of the outer loop) should be sorted and contain the smallest elements encountered so far in their correct positions.\\n\\nThus, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `i` corresponds to the variable `o`) can be stated as:\\n\\n`arr[0]->arr[o] = sorted_min(arr[0]->arr[o])`\\n\\nThis invariant indicates that the elements from the beginning of the array up to the current index `o` are sorted in ascending order and are the smallest elements encountered from the start of the array to the current index `o`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0]->arr[o] = sorted_min(arr[0]->arr[o])`\""}]
