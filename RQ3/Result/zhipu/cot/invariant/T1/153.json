[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of the function is to calculate the sum of all elements in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration should express the sum of the elements of the array from the start up to the current index `n`. Before the first iteration, the sum is initialized to 0, which is the sum of zero elements. At each iteration, `sum_value` is updated to include the value of the current element `arr[n]`, so the sum reflects the total of all elements from the start of the array up to and including `arr[n]`.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration, where `n` is the loop control variable, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n`partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[n-1])`\\n\\nHowever, since the format specified requires the invariant to be presented in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we can adjust the expression to fit the format:\\n\\n`sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[n])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds before the loop starts and after each iteration of the loop.

This change means that the loop will iterate over all indices from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`, inclusive.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should still express the sum of the elements of the array from the start up to the current index `n`, just as in the previous example. Since the loop condition includes the last index, the invariant should hold true for `n` ranging from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration, the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[n])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds before the loop starts, at the beginning of each iteration, and at the end of each iteration.
