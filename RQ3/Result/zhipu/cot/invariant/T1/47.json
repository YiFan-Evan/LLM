[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of the function is to count the number of occurrences of `target` in the list `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the number of times `target` has been found in the elements of `arr` from the start of the array up to the current index `h`. Before the loop starts, the count is 0 because no elements have been checked yet.

This change doesn't affect the logic or the loop invariant significantly. The loop still iterates over each element of the array `arr` and counts the occurrences of `target`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should still express the number of times `target` has been found in the elements of `arr` from the start of the array up to and including the current index `h`.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (with `i` being the current index `h`) remains the same:\\n\\n`count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[h])`\\n\\nWhere `fun` is a function that counts the number of occurrences of `target` in the subarray `arr[0:h]`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[h])`\""}]
