[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of this function is to calculate the sum of all elements in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the sum of the elements from the start of the array up to the current index `f`. Before the loop starts, `sum_value` is 0, and no elements have been added to it. At each iteration, the loop adds the value of the current element `arr[f]` to `sum_value`.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration, where `i` is the current index `f`, can be stated as:\\n\\n`partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `partial_sum_value` is the sum of the elements from the start of the array up to, but not including, the current index `i`.
