As the loop progresses, we want to maintain an invariant that `max_value` is the maximum value among the elements from the start of the array up to the current index `h`.\\n\\nAt the start of the i-th iteration (where `i` corresponds to the index `h`), the invariant would be:\\n\\n- `max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `max_value` holds the maximum value among the first `i` elements of the array (`arr[0]` through `arr[i-1]`).\\n\\nAfter the i-th iteration, if `arr[h]` is greater than `max_value`, then `max_value` is updated to `arr[h]`.
