[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of the loop is to find the minimum value in the array `arr`. \\n\\nAt the start of the loop, `min_value` is initialized to `arr[0]` and `p` is initialized to `0`. The loop continues until `p` has traversed the entire array (`p < len(arr)`). Within the loop, if `arr[p]` is less than `min_value`, `min_value` is updated to `arr[p]`. \\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the fact that after `p` iterations, `min_value` holds the minimum value of the first `p+1` elements of the array. Therefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration, where `i` is represented by `p`, can be stated as:\\n\\n`min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[p])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds before the i-th iteration because we are asserting that `min_value` is the minimum of the elements we have looked at so far (from the start of the array to the current position `p`).

Since the loop updates `p` before the condition check and possible update of `min_value`, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration, where `i` is represented by `p + 1` (to account for the initial value of `p` being `-1`), can be stated as:\\n\\n`min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[p])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds before the i-th iteration because it asserts that `min_value` is the minimum of the elements we have looked at so far.
