[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of the loop remains the same: to calculate the sum of all elements in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration should still capture the sum of elements from the start of the array up to the current index `q`.
