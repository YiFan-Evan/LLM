[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of the function is to calculate the sum of all elements in the array `arr`. \\n\\nBefore the loop starts, the `sum_value` is initialized to 0, which means it holds the sum of the elements of `arr` that have been processed so far (in this case, none).\\n\\nAt the i-th iteration of the loop, where `i` ranges from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`, the loop performs two actions:\\n1.
