[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of this function is to return the last element of the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the idea that `last_value` is being updated to the last element of the subarray considered up to the current index `p`. At the beginning of the loop, `last_value` is initialized to the first element of the array, and `p` is set to 0.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the loop, we want to express that `last_value` holds the last element of the subarray `arr[0...p-1]`.

The purpose of this function is still to return the last element of the array `arr`.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the loop (considering 0-based indexing for the iterations), `p` will be `i - 1` after the increment at the start of the iteration (since it starts at `-1`).
