[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

At the start of the loop, `min_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`, so we can say that `min_value` holds the minimum of the first element.
