The purpose of the function is to count the number of occurrences of `target` in the list `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should reflect the number of times the target has been found in the elements of `arr` from index `0` to `p` (exclusive), because the loop iterates over the array and increments the count each time the target is found.\\n\\nAt the start of the loop (`p = 0`), no elements have been checked yet, so the count should be 0.

The loop continues until `p` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, and `count_value` is incremented each time `arr[p]` matches the `target`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the fact that `count_value` holds the number of times `target` has been found in the elements of `arr` from the start up to, but not including, the current index `p`.\\n\\nAt the start of the first iteration (`p = -1`), `count_value` should be `0` because no elements have been checked yet.
