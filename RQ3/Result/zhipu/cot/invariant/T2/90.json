[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of the function is to return the last element of the array `arr`.

At the beginning of the loop, `last_value` holds the first element. After each iteration, `last_value` should hold the value of the last element that has been visited in the array.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\\n\\n`last_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `last_value` is the function `fun` applied to the sequence from the first element to the i-th element of the array.
