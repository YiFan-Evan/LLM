The goal of selection sort is to sort an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, the invariant should state that the subarray `arr[0:c]` is sorted. However, since the prompt asks for the loop invariant in a specific format, we will express it in terms of the function `fun`.\\n\\nBefore the first iteration of the outer loop (when `c = 0`), the invariant is trivially true because there are no elements to be out of order.\\n\\nNow, let's consider the i-th iteration of the outer loop. At this point, the subarray `arr[0:i]` should be sorted, and we are about to find the minimum element in the subarray `arr[i:len(arr)]` and place it at the beginning of the unsorted part.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as:\\n`arr[0:i]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nFor the inner loop, the invariant should state that, after each iteration, the minimum value found so far has been placed at the correct position, and the subarray `arr[c+1:z]` still contains the elements that have not been compared yet.\\n\\nBefore the first iteration of the inner loop (when `z = c + 1`), the invariant is that the smallest element found so far is at position `c`, and we have not yet compared it with the element at position `z`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be stated as:\\n`arr[c:z]_value = fun(arr[c]->arr[z-1])`\\n\\nSince the prompt asks for only one loop invariant in the specified format and the outer loop is the one that encapsulates the sorting process, we will focus on that.

This is a slight variation from the standard selection sort, but the logic remains the same: find the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array and swap it with the element at the current position `c`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the outer loop should state that after each iteration, the subarray `arr[0:c]` contains the smallest `c` elements in sorted order.
