[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of the loop is to iterate through the array to find the maximum value.\\n\\nIn this function, the loop starts with `n = -1` and increments `n` by 1 before the condition check. This means that the first element of the array is considered at the second iteration (when `n` equals 0), which is slightly different from the previous example.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration, where `i` ranges from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`, should state that `max_value` is the maximum value found in the elements of the array from the start up to, but not including, the current element `arr[i]`.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds because before each iteration starts, `max_value` has been determined by considering all elements up to the one before the current element (since `n` is incremented before the condition check). After the loop completes, `max_value` will contain the maximum value of the entire array.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\""}]
