[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of this function is to find the value of the element at the index `id` in the array `arr`. \\n\\nThe loop invariant should express that up to the current index `h`, no element has been found that matches the `id`. This means that the `member_value` remains unchanged until the index `h` matches the `id`. \\n\\nAt the start of the loop (`h = 0`), `member_value` is initialized to `-1`, which signifies that no element has been found yet.
