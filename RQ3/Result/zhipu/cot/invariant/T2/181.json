Selection sort works by iteratively finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning of the array.\\n\\nThe outer loop variable `b` is used to keep track of the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts of the array. At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the part of the array before index `b` is sorted, and the part from index `b` to the end of the array is unsorted.\\n\\nFor the inner loop, the variable `z` starts from `b + 1` and goes up to the end of the array. The invariant should capture that after each inner loop iteration, the minimum value found so far in the unsorted part of the array (from `b + 1` to `z`) has been placed at the beginning of the unsorted part, which is index `b`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\n`arr[b]->arr[b] = fun(arr[b+1]->arr[i])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the value at index `b` is the minimum value found in the subarray from index `b+1` to the current index `i` of the inner loop.

This is a slight variation from the standard selection sort where `b` starts at `0`. However, the loop invariant remains similar because the algorithm's purpose is still to sort the array by placing the smallest unsorted element at the beginning of the unsorted portion of the array.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop should express that the smallest element found in the unsorted portion of the array (from index `b+1` to `z`) has been moved to the index `b`. Since `b` starts at `-1` and is incremented to `0` before the first iteration, the invariant will hold from the second iteration onward (when `b` is actually used in the comparison).\\n\\nThe loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`arr[b]->arr[b] = fun(arr[b+1]->arr[z])`\\n\\nThis states that the value at index `b` is the result of a function `fun` that finds the minimum value in the subarray from index `b+1` to the current index `z` of the inner loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[b]->arr[b] = fun(arr[b+1]->arr[z])`\""}]
