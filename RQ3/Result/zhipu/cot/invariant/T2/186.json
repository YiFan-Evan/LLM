It does so by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning of the array.\\n\\nThe outer while loop iterates over the array indices starting from `g = 0` to the last index. The variable `g` represents the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts of the array. At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the element at index `g` is the smallest of the elements from the start of the array up to index `g`.\\n\\nThe inner while loop looks for the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array, which starts from index `g + 1`. If a smaller element is found than the current element at index `g`, a swap is performed.\\n\\nNow, let's define the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop. After `i` iterations, the first `i` elements of the array `arr` are sorted in ascending order, and they are the smallest `i` elements from the original array.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should state that the value at the start of the sorted part (`g`) is the smallest among all the elements considered up to that point in the array. Therefore, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[g])`\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration, `g` would be `i`. Thus, the loop invariant is:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    g = -1\n    while g < len(arr) - 1:\n        g += 1\n        z = g + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[g]:\n                temp = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"In this modified version of the `selection_sort` function, the initial value of `g` is set to `-1`, but it is incremented to `0` before the first iteration of the outer while loop. The rest of the function works the same way as a standard selection sort, with the goal of sorting the array in ascending order.\\n\\nFor the loop invariant, we want to express a condition that remains true before and after each iteration of the outer while loop. Given that `g` is the index that marks the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts of the array, and it is incremented after each outer loop iteration, we can say that after `g` iterations, the subarray `arr[0...g]` contains the smallest `g+1` elements from the original array in sorted order.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `i` ranges from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`) can be stated as:\\n\\n`sorted_min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the subarray `arr[0...i]` contains the smallest elements in sorted order, which is the condition we expect to hold true after `i` iterations of the outer loop.\\n\\nThus, the final answer is:\\n\\n`sorted_min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\""}]
