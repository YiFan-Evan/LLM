[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

At the i-th iteration, just before the condition is checked, `min_value` should represent the minimum value among the elements from the start of the array up to the index `i` (which has already been incremented once, so it's effectively up to `i-1` in terms of the original array elements).\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant at the i-th iteration, just after `i` has been incremented and before the condition check, is:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nThis states that `min_value` is the minimum value among the elements from the start of the array up to and including the element at the current index `i`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\""}]
