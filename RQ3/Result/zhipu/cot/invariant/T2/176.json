The inner loop, controlled by the variable `z`, is responsible for inserting the `q`-th element into its correct position within the sorted portion of the array.\\n\\nLet's consider the loop invariant for the `q`-th iteration of the outer loop. We want to express the state of the array in a way that holds true before and after each iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nBefore the `q`-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0...q-1]` is sorted. During the `q`-th iteration, we are trying to maintain this sorted order while inserting `arr[q]`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the inner loop (at the i-th iteration) can be stated as: `arr[0...z]` is sorted for each `z` during the `q`-th iteration of the outer loop. However, we need to express it in the form specified in your instruction, which is `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`.\\n\\nSince the inner loop moves elements to the right to make space for the `q`-th element and keeps the subarray `arr[0...z]` sorted, we can express the loop invariant as follows:\\n\\n- Before the first iteration of the inner loop for the `q`-th element (when `z = q`), the invariant is `arr[0...z-1]_value = sorted(arr[0...z-1]->arr[0...z-1])`.\\n- After each swap in the inner loop (when `z > 0` and `arr[z - 1] > arr[z]`), the invariant is `arr[0...z-2]_value = sorted(arr[0...z-2]->arr[0...z-2])` because the swap doesn't affect the sorted order of the subarray `arr[0...z-2]`.\\n\\nHowever, to keep the format consistent and since the inner loop is responsible for the sorted order up to the current `z`, we can simplify the invariant to:\\n\\n`arr[0...z-1]_value = sorted(arr[0...z-1]->arr[0...z-1])`\\n\\nAfter considering the constraints of the format you've asked for, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop during the q-th iteration of the outer loop is:\\n\\n`arr[0...z]_value = sorted(arr[0...z]->arr[0...z])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0...z]_value = sorted(arr[0...z]->arr[0...z])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = -1\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:\n        q += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"It seems there is a mistake in the code snippet provided. The variable `i` is being used in the inner while loop, but it is not defined within the function. It's likely that `i` was intended to be `q`, which is the variable that is incremented in the outer while loop.\\n\\nAssuming that the variable `i` is a typo and should be `q`, let's analyze the loop to find the loop invariant.\\n\\nThe function `insertion_sort` sorts an array `arr` using the insertion sort algorithm. The outer loop iterates from `-1` to `len(arr) - 2` (since `q` is initialized to `-1` and incremented before the inner loop). The purpose of the outer loop is to place the `q`-th element in its correct position in the sorted subarray `arr[0...q]`.\\n\\nThe inner loop starts from the current `q` position and compares the element `arr[q]` with each element before it. If an element before it is greater than `arr[q]`, they are swapped. This process continues until `arr[q]` is in the correct position, which is denoted by the variable `z`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop (with the assumption that `i` is a typo and should be `q`) would be:\\n\\nBefore the inner loop starts for the `q`-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0...q-1]` is sorted. During the inner loop, we are maintaining this sorted order while inserting `arr[q]`. Therefore, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\\n\\n`arr[0...z]_value = sorted(arr[0...z]->arr[0...z])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the subarray from the start to the current index `z` is sorted after each iteration of the inner loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0...z]_value = sorted(arr[0...z]->arr[0...z])`\""}]
