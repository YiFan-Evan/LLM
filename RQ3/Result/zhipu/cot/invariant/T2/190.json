The inner loop, with the variable `z`, looks for this smallest element.\\n\\nAt the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the invariant we're looking for should hold true for the elements that have been processed so far.

Instead, we need to express it in terms of the array's values and indices, as specified:\\n\\nFor the `i-th` (where `i = k + 1`) iteration of the outer loop, we can state the loop invariant as:\\n\\n`arr[0..k-1]_min_value = fun(arr[0..k-1]->arr[0..k-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the minimum value in the subarray `arr[0..k-1]` is correctly placed in the position `arr[0]` after `k` iterations of the outer loop.
