[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of the function is to calculate the sum of all elements in the array `arr`. \\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the sum of the elements from the start of the array up to the current index `t`. At the start of the loop (`t=0`), the sum of the elements considered is just the first element of the array. With each iteration, we add the next element in the array to the sum.\\n\\nTherefore, at the i-th iteration (where `t` is the loop control variable), the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[t-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `partial_sum_value` is the sum of the elements from the start of the array up to, but not including, the current index `t`.

In this case, the loop starts with `t = -1`, so the first iteration will increment `t` to 0 and then add `arr[0]` to `sum_value`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant at the i-th iteration, considering that `t` starts at -1 and is incremented before the sum is updated, can be stated as:\\n\\n`partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[t])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds true because at each iteration, `t` represents the index of the last element added to `sum_value`. Before the first iteration (`t = -1`), `partial_sum_value` is 0, which is the sum of zero elements. After the first iteration (`t = 0`), `partial_sum_value` is `arr[0]`, and so on, with each iteration adding one more element to the sum.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[t])`\""}]
