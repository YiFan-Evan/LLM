The loop invariant for the outer loop should state that the elements from the start of the array up to the current index `r` are sorted. However, since `r` starts at `-1` and is incremented to `0` before the first comparison, the sorted portion initially contains no elements.\\n\\nHere's the thought process for determining the loop invariant:\\n\\n- Initially, before the first iteration of the outer loop (`r = -1`), there are no elements in the sorted portion, so the property holds trivially.\\n- At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (`r` is now the index of the last element of the sorted portion), the invariant should state that the subarray `arr[0]->arr[r]` is sorted.\\n- After the inner loop completes, the smallest element from the unsorted subarray `arr[r+1]->arr[len(arr)-1]` has been moved to the position `arr[r]`, and the subarray `arr[0]->arr[r+1]` should be sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as:\\n\\n`arr[0]->arr[r]` is sorted.\\n\\nSince the outer loop does not modify the array except for swapping the minimum element into the correct position, the invariant will hold true after the inner loop completes.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0]->arr[r] = sorted(arr[0]->arr[r])`\""}]
