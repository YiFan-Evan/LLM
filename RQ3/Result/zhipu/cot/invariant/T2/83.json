[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of this function is to return the last element of the array `arr`.\\n\\nIn the first iteration, `d` is 0, and `last_value` is set to `arr[0]`. For each subsequent iteration, `d` increases by 1, and `last_value` is updated to the value of `arr[d]`. The loop continues until `d` is equal to the length of the array, at which point the loop terminates and the last value encountered is returned.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should reflect that `last_value` holds the value of the last element accessed, which will eventually be the last element of the array. At the start of the first iteration, this is `arr[0]`, but as `d` increases, `last_value` will hold the value of `arr[d-1]` (since `d` is incremented after updating `last_value`).\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration can be stated as:\\n`last_value = fun(arr[d-1]->arr[d-1])`\\n\\nHere, `fun` is a placeholder for the operation that is being performed, which in this case is just assignment.
