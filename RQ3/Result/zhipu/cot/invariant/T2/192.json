The function `fun` here represents the operation of checking if a subarray is sorted.\\n\\nNow, let's analyze the inner loop:\\n\\n- The inner loop starts with `z = m + 1`, which means it starts comparing elements from the unsorted part of the array.\\n- The inner loop finds the minimum element in the subarray `arr[m+1]->arr[len(arr)-1]`.\\n- If a smaller element than `arr[m]` is found, it is swapped with `arr[m]`.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop, considering both the outer and inner loops, can be described as:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m-1])`\\n\\nBefore the i-th iteration:\\n- The subarray `arr[0]->arr[m-1]` is sorted.\\n- The subarray `arr[m]->arr[len(arr)-1]` is unsorted.\\n\\nAfter the i-th iteration:\\n- The smallest element in the subarray `arr[m]->arr[len(arr)-1]` has been moved to the position `arr[m]`.\\n- The subarray `arr[0]->arr[m]` is now sorted.\\n- The subarray `arr[m+1]->arr[len(arr)-1]` remains unsorted but contains one less element than before.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`sorted_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    m = -1\n    while m < len(arr) - 1:\n        m += 1\n        z = m + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[m]:\n                temp = arr[m]\n                arr[m] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The provided code is a variant of the selection sort algorithm.
