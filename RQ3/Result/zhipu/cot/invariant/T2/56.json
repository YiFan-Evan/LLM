The purpose of the function is to count the number of occurrences of `target` in the list `arr`. \\n\\nAt the start of the loop, `count_value` is initialized to 0, which means it represents the count of the target found in the elements of `arr[0]->arr[q-1]` (where `q` starts at 0). As the loop progresses, `q` increases, and `count_value` is updated whenever `arr[q]` matches the `target`.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the loop, the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nwhere `fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])` is a function that returns the count of the number of times `target` appears in the subarray from index 0 to index `i-1` of `arr`.\\n\\nBefore the first iteration (`i=0`), `count_value` is 0, which correctly represents the count of `target` in an empty subarray.

After the increment of `q` at the beginning of each iteration, `q` will be `i - 1` at the start of the i-th iteration.
