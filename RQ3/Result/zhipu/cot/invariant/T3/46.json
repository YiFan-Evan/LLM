[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of this function is to count the number of occurrences of `target` in the list `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the count of the target occurrences found in the elements of the array from the start up to the current index `g`. Before the loop starts, `count_value` is initialized to 0, and no elements have been checked yet.

The purpose of this function is still to count the number of occurrences of `target` in the list `arr`, but this time the loop iterates backward from the end of the list.\\n\\nBefore the loop starts, `count_value` is initialized to 0, and `g` is set to the length of `arr`, which means no elements have been checked yet. The loop invariant should express the count of the target occurrences found in the elements of the array from the current index `g` to the end of the array.\\n\\nAt the i-th iteration, with `g` being the loop control variable decrementing each time, the invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n- `count_value = number_of_target_occurrences_in(arr[g]->arr[end])` where `end` is the last index of the array (which is `len(arr) - 1`), and `number_of_target_occurrences_in` is a conceptual function that counts the number of times `target` appears in the subarray from index `g` to the end of the array.\\n\\nSince the loop decrements `g` by 1 in each iteration, the subarray considered by the invariant shrinks by one element from the beginning of the subarray. If `arr[g]` is equal to `target`, `count_value` will be incremented by 1, reflecting the fact that we have found one more occurrence of `target` in the remaining part of the array.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration is:\\n\\n- `count_value = number_of_target_occurrences_in(arr[g]->arr[end])`\\n\\nThus, the final answer is:\\n\\n`count_value = number_of_target_occurrences_in(arr[g]->arr[end])`\""}]
