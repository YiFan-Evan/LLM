The goal of this function is to return the value of the element at index `id` in the array `arr`. \\n\\nLet's consider the variable `member_value`. Initially, it is set to `-1`, which indicates that the element has not been found yet. The loop is iterating over the array indices from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`. The invariant should capture the purpose of the loop, which is to find the element at the specified `id` index.\\n\\nAt the start of each iteration, `member_value` should represent the value found at the current index or `-1` if the element hasn't been found yet. Therefore, the loop invariant could be that `member_value` is either `-1` or the value of the element at the index that has been checked so far.\\n\\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` represents the current index `j`) would be:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0->i-1]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `member_value` holds the value of the last element checked in the array, or `-1` if no element has been checked yet.
