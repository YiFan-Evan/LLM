[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop continues to iterate as long as `m` is less than the length of the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the fact that `last_value` holds the value of the last element encountered in the array as the loop progresses.

The loop starts with `first_value` initialized to `arr[-1]`, which is the last element of the array, and `m` initialized to the length of the array.

Since the loop is decrementing `m`, at each iteration `first_value` is being set to the element that is closer to the first element of the array.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\\n\\n`first_value = fun(arr[m]->arr[m])`\\n\\nThis invariant implies that `first_value` is the value of the element at index `m` at each iteration of the loop.
