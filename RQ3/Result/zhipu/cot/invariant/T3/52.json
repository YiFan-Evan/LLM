[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of the function is to count the number of times the `target` appears in the list `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the count of the target occurrences found in the elements of `arr` from the start up to the current index `m`. Therefore, at the i-th iteration, the loop invariant will express the count of the target found in the first `m` elements of the array.\\n\\nBefore we enter the loop for the first time, `count_value` is initialized to 0, and `m` is initialized to 0.
