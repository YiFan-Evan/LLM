[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop continues to decrement `r` until `r` becomes 0, and in each iteration, `first_value` is updated to the current element `arr[r]`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the property that `first_value` is equal to the element that will become the first element of the array once all elements up to `r-1` have been processed.
