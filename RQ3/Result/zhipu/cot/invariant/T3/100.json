The purpose of the function `give_member` is to return the value of the element at the index `id` in the array `arr`. \\n\\nIn the loop, the variable `a` is used as the index to iterate over the elements of `arr`. The loop invariant should reflect the relationship between `member_value` and the elements of `arr` up to the current index `a`.\\n\\nBefore the loop starts, `member_value` is initialized to `-1`, which indicates that no valid member has been found yet.
