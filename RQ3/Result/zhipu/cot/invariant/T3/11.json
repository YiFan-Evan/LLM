The purpose of the function is to find the maximum value in the array. \\n\\nAt the start of the loop, `max_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`, and `l` is initialized to `0`. For the loop invariant, we want to express that `max_value` is the maximum value among the elements `arr[0]` to `arr[l-1]` at the beginning of each iteration.\\n\\nAt the i-th iteration, where `i` corresponds to the loop index `l`, the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `max_value` holds the maximum value found in the subarray from index `0` to `i-1` inclusive, which is true before the i-th iteration starts. Each iteration checks if the current element `arr[l]` is greater than `max_value`. If it is, `max_value` is updated to `arr[l]`.
