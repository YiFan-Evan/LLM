[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of this function is to find the value of the element at the index `id` within the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the fact that up to the current index `p`, we have not found the element with the index `id`, and thus `member_value` remains unchanged (set to -1 initially).
