Also, the outer loop starts with `j = len(arr)` and decrements `j` until it reaches 0, which is a common pattern in the insertion sort algorithm. The inner loop is meant to place the element at index `j-1` into its correct position within the sorted subarray `arr[0...j-1]`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the outer loop at the i-th iteration should state that the subarray `arr[i...len(arr)-1]` is sorted. This is because after each iteration of the outer loop, we ensure that the element at `arr[i-1]` is in its correct position, making the subarray from `i` to the end of the array sorted.\\n\\nFor the inner loop, the invariant should state that after `z` iterations, the element at `arr[j-1]` (which is the current element being placed in the sorted subarray) is correctly positioned between elements `arr[0...z-1]` such that the subarray `arr[0...z]` is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer for the loop invariants are:\\n\\nFor the outer loop:\\n`arr[i...len(arr)-1]_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\\n\\nFor the inner loop:\\n`arr[0...z]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z])`\\n\\nSince `j` is being decremented in the outer loop, we can also express the outer loop invariant in terms of `j` as follows:\\n`arr[j...len(arr)-1]_value = fun(arr[j]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\\n\\nAnd since `j` is being decremented and `z` is being incremented, we can also express the inner loop invariant in terms of `j` as follows:\\n`arr[0...len(arr)-j]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[len(arr)-j])` \\n\\nHowever, it's important to note that `i` should be `j` in both loops, and the loop invariants should be adjusted accordingly if the variable names are corrected in the code.\""}]
