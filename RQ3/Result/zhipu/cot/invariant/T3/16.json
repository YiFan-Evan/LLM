The purpose of the function is to find the maximum value in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the following idea: At the start of each iteration, `max_value` holds the maximum value found so far in the subarray `arr[0...q-1]`. Let's write the loop invariant for the i-th iteration, where `q` is the loop control variable:\\n\\nBefore the i-th iteration (where `i` is equivalent to `q` in this context), the invariant is:\\n`max_value = max(arr[0...i-1])`\\n\\nAfter the i-th iteration, if `arr[i]` is not greater than `max_value`, the invariant remains the same because `max_value` is not updated. If `arr[i]` is greater, then `max_value` is updated to `arr[i]`, which means the new invariant reflects the maximum value in the subarray `arr[0...i]`:\\n`max_value = max(arr[0...i])`\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration is:\\n`max_value = max(arr[0...i-1])`\\n\\nSince the loop starts with `q = 0`, the invariant holds before the first iteration, and it is maintained after each iteration.

The function is designed to find the maximum value in the array `arr`, and it starts by assuming the last element of the array is the maximum.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express a property that remains true throughout the loop's execution. In this case, we want to express that `max_value` holds the maximum value of the elements that have been examined so far.\\n\\nBefore the first iteration, `max_value` is set to `arr[-1]`, which is the last element of the array. The loop control variable `q` is initialized to the length of the array, and the loop decrements `q` until it reaches 0.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` is the index of the current element being compared, which corresponds to `len(arr) - q`) can be stated as follows:\\n\\nBefore the i-th iteration:\\n`max_value = max(arr[len(arr) - q...len(arr) - 1])`\\n\\nAfter the i-th iteration, if `arr[q]` (which is `arr[len(arr) - q]`) is not greater than `max_value`, the invariant remains the same.
