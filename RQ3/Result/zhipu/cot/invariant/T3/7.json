[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop is intended to find the maximum value in the array `arr`.\\n\\nAt the start of the loop, `max_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`, and `h` is the index of the current element being compared to `max_value`. The loop invariant should express the idea that `max_value` holds the maximum value found in the array from the start up to the current index `h`.\\n\\nBefore the first iteration (when `h = 0`), the invariant would be:\\n\\n`max_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[0])`\\n\\nSince `fun` is not defined in the prompt, I'll interpret the requirement as a statement that captures the current state of `max_value` in relation to the elements of `arr` up to the current index `h`. Therefore, the loop invariant at the start of each iteration (for the i-th iteration, where `h = i`) would be:\\n\\n`max_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `max_value` is the maximum value among the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i]`.\\n\\nAfter the loop completes the i-th iteration, the invariant still holds because the loop checks if the current element `arr[h]` is greater than `max_value` and updates `max_value` if it is.
