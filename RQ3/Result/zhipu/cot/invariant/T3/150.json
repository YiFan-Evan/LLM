[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of this function is to calculate the sum of all elements in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the sum of the elements from the start of the array up to the current index `k`. Before the loop starts, the sum is 0, which is the sum of zero elements.

At the start of the loop (`k=0`), this is the sum of no elements, which is 0.
