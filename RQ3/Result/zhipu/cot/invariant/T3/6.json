The loop variable `g` is also initialized to 0, which represents the current index we are checking in the array.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the fact that `max_value` holds the maximum value found in the array from index 0 to the current index `g` at the start of each iteration.

For the i-th iteration, where `g` starts at `len(arr)` and decrements to `len(arr) - i`, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\\n\\nBefore the i-th iteration (where `g` is equal to `len(arr) - i`):\\n\\n`max_value = max(arr[len(arr) - i]->arr[-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds because at the start of each iteration, `max_value` contains the maximum value found from the current index to the end of the array.\\n\\nAfter the loop finishes the i-th iteration, if `arr[g]` (which is `arr[len(arr) - i]`) is greater than `max_value`, `max_value` is updated to this new value.
