[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of this function is to return the last element of the array `arr`. \\n\\nAt the beginning of the loop, `last_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`. As the loop progresses, `last_value` is updated to the current element `arr[a]`. We are looking for a statement that captures the essence of what `last_value` represents at each iteration.\\n\\nBefore the first iteration (i.e., when `a = 0`), `last_value` holds the first element of the array. After the first iteration, `last_value` should hold the last element of the array up to index `a`.

The loop starts with `first_value` initialized to `arr[-1]`, which is the last element of the array, and then it decrements `a` until `a` is greater than 0. In each iteration, `first_value` is updated to the current element `arr[a]`.\\n\\nTo find the loop invariant, we need to identify a property that remains true throughout each iteration. Initially, `first_value` is the last element of the array. As `a` decrements, `first_value` changes to the previous element in the array. The invariant should reflect that `first_value` is always the first element of the subarray from index `a` to the end of the array.\\n\\nAt the i-th iteration, if `a` is the current index, the loop invariant would be:\\n\\n`first_value = arr[a->len(arr)-1]`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `first_value` is equal to the first element of the subarray from index `a` to the last index of the array.
