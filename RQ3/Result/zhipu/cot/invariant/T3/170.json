The insertion sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted part and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should be true before and after each iteration of the outer while loop, which is controlled by the variable `k`. Let's denote the `i-th` iteration of the outer loop. At this point, the first `i` elements of the array should be sorted.\\n\\nBefore the `i-th` iteration starts, the invariant would be:\\n\\n`sorted(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis states that the subarray from index 0 to `i-1` is sorted. Now, let's consider what happens during the `i-th` iteration. The inner while loop is responsible for inserting the `i-th` element into its correct position within the sorted subarray `arr[0]->arr[i-1]`. After the `i-th` iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0]->arr[i]` should also be sorted.\\n\\nAfter the `i-th` iteration finishes, the invariant has been maintained and extended to include the `i-th` element:\\n\\n`sorted(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nHowever, since the instructions specify that the answer should only contain statements in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we need to rephrase the invariant to fit this format. We can express the sorted subarray as having a certain property, such as being in non-decreasing order. Therefore, we could write the loop invariant as:\\n\\n`non_decreasing_order_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[k-1])`\\n\\nbefore the `k-th` iteration and\\n\\n`non_decreasing_order_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[k])`\\n\\nafter the `k-th` iteration.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\nBefore the `i-th` iteration: `non_decreasing_order_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[k-1])`\\nAfter the `i-th` iteration: `non_decreasing_order_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[k])`\\n\\nPlease note that there was a typo in the original code snippet provided; the variable `i` is not defined within the function.

Let's analyze the corrected version of the `insertion_sort` function. In this version, the variable `k` starts with the length of the array and decrements with each iteration of the outer while loop.
