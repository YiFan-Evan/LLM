[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of the function is to count the number of occurrences of `target` in the array `arr`. \\n\\nThe loop invariant should capture the fact that `count_value` is counting the occurrences of `target` in the elements of `arr` from index `0` to index `l-1`. \\n\\nBefore the loop starts, `l` is `0` and `count_value` is `0`, so the invariant holds trivially.

The purpose of the function remains the same: to count the number of occurrences of `target` in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should still capture the fact that `count_value` is counting the occurrences of `target`, but now we need to account for the fact that we are iterating from the end of the array towards the beginning. At the start of each iteration, `count_value` represents the number of times `target` has been found in the elements from the end of the array up to, but not including, the current index `l`.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration, where `l` has been decremented `i` times (starting from `len(arr)`), can be expressed as:\\n\\n`count_value = fun(arr[l+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\\n\\nwhere `fun(arr[l+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])` is a function that returns the number of times `target` appears in the subarray from index `l+1` to the last index of the array `arr`.\\n\\nSince the loop starts with `l` equal to `len(arr)` and decrements `l` until it reaches `0`, the subarray described by `arr[l+1]->arr[len(arr)-1]` is effectively the entire array minus the last `l` elements that have not yet been checked.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`count_value = fun(arr[l+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])`\""}]
