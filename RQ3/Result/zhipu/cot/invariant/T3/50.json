The purpose of the function is to count the number of times the `target` appears in the list `arr`.\\n\\nLet's analyze the loop:\\n\\n- Before the loop starts, `count_value` is initialized to 0, which means `count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[0])` does not apply because no elements have been checked yet.\\n- At each iteration, the loop checks if the current element `arr[k]` is equal to the `target`. If it is, `count_value` is incremented by 1.\\n- The variable `k` is used to track the current index in the array and is incremented by 1 at each iteration.\\n\\nConsidering this, a loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where i ranges from 0 to len(arr) - 1) could be:\\n\\n- `count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`, which implies that `count_value` represents the number of times the `target` has been found in the elements from the start of the array up to, but not including, the current element `arr[i]`.\\n\\nSince we're asked to provide the loop invariant in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we can adjust the above invariant to fit the format.
