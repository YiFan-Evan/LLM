[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of the function is to return the value of the element at index `id` in the array `arr`. \\n\\nAt the start of the loop, `member_value` is initialized to `-1`, which is the value that will be returned if the `id` is not found within the range of valid indices of `arr`. As the loop progresses, we want to capture the property that at each iteration, `member_value` will either remain `-1` if the `id` hasn't been found yet, or it will hold the value of the element at the current index `n` if `n` is equal to `id`.\\n\\nThus, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be expressed as:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0->i-1]->arr[i-1])` where `fun` is a function that returns `-1` if `id` is not found in `arr[0->i-1]`, or returns `arr[i-1]` if `i-1` is equal to `id`.\\n\\nHowever, since the function is specified to be in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we need to adjust the notation to fit the requirement. The loop invariant at the i-th iteration would be:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0->n-1]->arr[n-1])`\\n\\nwhere `n` is the current loop index, which increments with each iteration.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0->n]->arr[n])` for each iteration where `n` is the current value of the loop variable before it is incremented.
