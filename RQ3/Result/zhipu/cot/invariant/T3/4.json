[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This satisfies the invariant because `max_value` is the maximum of the subarray that contains only the first element of `arr`.\\n\\n- Maintenance: During each iteration, `e` is incremented by 1, and we check if the current element `arr[e]` is greater than `max_value`. If it is, we update `max_value` to `arr[e]`.

The `max_value` is initialized to `arr[-1]`, the last element of the array. This satisfies the invariant because `max_value` starts as the maximum of a subarray that contains only the last element.\\n\\n- Maintenance: During each iteration, `e` is decremented by 1, effectively moving the boundary of the unexamined subarray one element to the left. We then check if the current element `arr[e]` is greater than `max_value`. If it is, we update `max_value` to `arr[e]`. This maintains the invariant because after each iteration, `max_value` still represents the maximum value in the remaining subarray from the new index `e` to the end of the array.\\n\\n- Termination: When the loop terminates (i.e., `e` equals 0), the invariant tells us that `max_value` is the maximum of the entire array because all elements have been checked.
