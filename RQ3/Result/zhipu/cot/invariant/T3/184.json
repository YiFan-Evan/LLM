The variable `i` is not defined within the function. Assuming that `i` is meant to be `e`, let's correct the code and then find the loop invariant.\\n\\nHere is the corrected version of the selection sort algorithm with the variable `i` replaced by `e`:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    e = len(arr)\\n    while e > 0:\\n        min_index = 0\\n        for z in range(1, e):\\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\\n                min_index = z\\n        temp = arr[e-1]\\n        arr[e-1] = arr[min_index]\\n        arr[min_index] = temp\\n        e -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's find the loop invariant for this corrected code. The algorithm performs a selection sort in reverse, starting from the end of the array and moving the minimum element found to the end of the unsorted section of the array.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the outer loop, which is controlled by the variable `e`, the loop invariant should express that the elements from index `i` to the end of the array are sorted, and the minimum element of the remaining unsorted section has been moved to its correct position at the end of the array.\\n\\nBefore the first iteration of the outer loop, `e` is `len(arr)`, and the invariant would state that the entire array is considered sorted (trivially true as there are no elements to sort yet).\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`arr[i->len(arr)-1] = sorted(arr[i->len(arr)-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant says that the subarray from index `i` to the end of the array is sorted, and it holds true before the i-th iteration starts and after it ends.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[i->len(arr)-1] = sorted(arr[i->len(arr)-1])`\""}]
