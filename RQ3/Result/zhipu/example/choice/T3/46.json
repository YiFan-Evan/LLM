Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where do most people make coffee?\nOptions: A. coffee shop B. office C. table D. washing E. kitchen"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"E\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where do most people make coffee?
