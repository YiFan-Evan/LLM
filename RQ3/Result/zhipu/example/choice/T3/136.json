[{"role": "user", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is a form of anaerobic exercising?\nOptions: A. shortness of breath B. lift weights C. error D. fall down E. run"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"B\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is a form of anaerobic exercising? (Since the reason-word \"anaerobic\" is in the question stem and the reason-word \"exercising\" is among the top 5 reason-words, the model predicts that the correct option is \"lift weights\", which is a form of anaerobic exercise that involves short bursts of high-intensity movements. Therefore, the predicted option is not \"shortness of breath\" as provided, but rather \"lift weights\".)\nOptions: A. shortness of breath B. lift weights C. error D. fall down E. run"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"B\""}]
