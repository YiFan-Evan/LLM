[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Then, du = dx and v = e^x. This gives us:\\n\\n\u222b(e^x * x^(-1))dx = x * e^x - \u222be^x dx = x * e^x - e^x\\n\\nFor the second integral, we again use integration by parts with u = x and dv = e^(-x) dx. Then, du = dx and v = -e^(-x).

However, since we are looking for the indefinite integral, we actually do not need to substitute x = 4 just yet. We should first simplify the expression by noting that (e^x - e^(-x)) is the hyperbolic sine function, sinh(x):\\n\\n= (1/2)[(x - 1) * sinh(x)]\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\\n\\n= (1/2)[(4 - 1) * sinh(4)]\\n= (1/2)[3 * sinh(4)]\\n\\nWe need to calculate sinh(4) and then multiply by 3/2. The value of sinh(4) is approximately 27.2899172. Multiplying by 3/2 gives us:\\n\\n= (3/2) * 27.2899172\\n= 40.9269758\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get 40.
