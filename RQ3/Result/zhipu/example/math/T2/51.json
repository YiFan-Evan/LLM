[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Thus, the function becomes:\\n\\ncos(x) * x^(-1)\\n\\nNow, we can integrate this function. The integral of cos(x) is sin(x), and the integral of x^(-1) is ln|x| (the natural logarithm of the absolute value of x). However, since we're dealing with the indefinite integral, we must also consider the integration with respect to x, which will give us an additional x in the denominator when integrating x^(-1). Therefore, the integral of cos(x) * x^(-1) with respect to x is:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x) * x^(-1) dx = sin(x) * x^(-1) - \u222b sin(x) * d(x^(-1))\\n\\nSince the derivative of x^(-1) with respect to x is -x^(-2), the integral becomes:\\n\\nsin(x) * x^(-1) + \u222b sin(x) * x^(-2) dx\\n\\nThe integral of sin(x) * x^(-2) dx can be found using integration by parts, but it turns out that this integral does not have a simple elementary form. However, we are interested in the indefinite integral which can be expressed as:\\n\\nsin(x)/x + C\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x=4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\nsin(4)/4 + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide the integer result of the expression by rounding down and to exclude the constant C, we only need to calculate sin(4)/4. Let's do that:\\n\\nsin(4)/4 \u2248 (-0.7568)/4 \u2248 -0.1892\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\\n\\n-1\\n\\nSo the final result is -1.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(cos(x)/(1/x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To calculate the indefinite integral of the function 5*(cos(x)/(1/x)), we can follow a similar process as before. First, rewrite the function using x^(-1) for 1/x:\\n\\n5 * cos(x) * x^(-1)\\n\\nNow, integrate this function. The constant 5 can be factored out of the integral:\\n\\n5 * \u222b cos(x) * x^(-1) dx\\n\\nWe already know from the previous explanation that the integral of cos(x) * x^(-1) is sin(x)/x + C.
