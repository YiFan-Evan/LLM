[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Therefore, the function 5*(sinh((1/x))*(1/(1/x))) is equivalent to 5*sinh(1), which is a constant multiple.\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of a constant is the constant times x. So, the indefinite integral of 5*sinh(1) with respect to x is 5*sinh(1)*x. When we substitute x = 4 into our expression 5*sinh(1)*x simplifies to a constant multiple of x, so the integral of 5*sinh(1)*x is 5*sinh(1)*x^2/2. Now, let's substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral we found:\\n\\n5*sinh(1)*x^2/2 becomes 5*sinh(1)*4^2/2 = 5*sinh(1)*16/2 = 40*sinh(1)*x becomes 40*sinh(1)*x when x = 4, this expression simplifies to 40*sinh(1)*4. The function 40*sinh(1)*x becomes 40*sinh(1)*4^2 when x = 4. This is because we are squaring x:\\n\\n40*sinh(1)*16\\n\\nThis expression simplifies to 640*sinh(1). Now, we need to calculate the value of 640*sinh(1). sinh(1) is approximately 1.1752, so:\\n\\n640*sinh(1) \u2248 640 * 1.1752 \u2248 752.128\\n\\nNow, let's round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\n752.128 when rounded down becomes 752.\\n\\nSo the integer result, after substituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral and rounding down, is:\\n\\n752\\n\\nNow, I will provide the integer result as requested:\\n\\n752\""}]
