[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Rounding down the result of -5*cos(4) gives us -5 (since cos(4) is approximately -0.6536, and -5 * -0.6536 is approximately 3.268, which rounds down to 3, but since we have the negative sign, it rounds down to -4).\\n\\nThe final integer result is: -4\""}]
