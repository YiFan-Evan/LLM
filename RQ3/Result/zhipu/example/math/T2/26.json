[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Since we're asked to round down to the nearest integer and we're not given a value for C, we'll ignore C for the purpose of this calculation.
