[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Substituting x=4 into -5*cos(x) gives -5*cos(4). Rounding down to the nearest integer, the result is approximately -5*0.6536 (since cos(4) is approximately 0.6536), which is -3.268.
