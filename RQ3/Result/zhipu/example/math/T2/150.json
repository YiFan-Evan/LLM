[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Let's use the same u and dv as before, so u = e^x and dv = cos(x)dx. Then, du = e^x dx and v = sin(x). Applying integration by parts again:\\n\\n\u222be^x*cos(x) dx = e^x*sin(x) - \u222bsin(x)*e^x dx\\n\\nNow, we already have an integral of sin(x)*e^x from the first step, which is what we're trying to integrate.
