[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

The integral of ln(x) with respect to x is x*ln(x) - x, and the integral of sinh(x) with respect to x is cosh(x). However, the integral of 1/sinh(x) is not elementary and involves the hyperbolic sine integral function, denoted as Si(x).\\n\\nThe integral of ln(x)/sinh(x) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions. However, we can write it in terms of the Si function as follows:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x)/sinh(x) dx = ln(x) * \u222b 1/sinh(x) dx - \u222b (d/dx ln(x)) * \u222b 1/sinh(x) dx dx\\n                    = ln(x) * Si(x) - \u222b Si(x)/x dx\\n\\nUnfortunately, the last integral, \u222b Si(x)/x dx, cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions either, and we would typically need to use numerical methods to find the definite integral.\\n\\nHowever, since we need to evaluate the integral at a specific point (x=4), we can use numerical integration methods to approximate the definite integral from 1 to 4 and then subtract the integral from 1 to 4 of the Si function. But since we are asked for an indefinite integral and then substituting x=4 into it, we will consider the Si(x) part evaluated at x=4 without the need to compute the second integral term.\\n\\nLet's assume we can ignore the second term for this problem and evaluate the integral at x=4 numerically. Using a calculator or software that can handle special functions, we find:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x)/sinh(x) dx at x=4 \u2248 0.5772156649  + ln(4) * Si(4)\\n\\nThe constant 0.5772156649 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant, which we can ignore for the purpose of this problem since we're only interested in the integer part after rounding down.\\n\\nNow, we need to calculate Si(4) and multiply it by ln(4) to approximate the value of the integral at x=4. Let's assume we have a tool that can calculate Si(4) for us.\\n\\nAfter calculating, let's say we get an approximate value. We would then round down to the nearest integer to get our final result.

However, for the purpose of this problem, we can proceed as if we were to calculate it numerically or using special functions, and then we would multiply by 5.\\n\\nLet's denote the integral of ln(x) / sinh(x) as I(x), then the integral of 5 * (ln(x) / sinh(x)) would be 5 * I(x).\\n\\nWe are asked to evaluate this integral at x = 4.
