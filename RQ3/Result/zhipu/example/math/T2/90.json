[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Let's denote t = ln(x), so dt = (1/x) dx, and dx = x dt. Then, the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b cos(ln(x)) dx = \u222b cos(t) x dt = \u222b cos(t) e^t dt\\n\\nThis is a standard integral of cos(t)e^t, which can be integrated by parts again with u = cos(t) and dv = e^t dt, resulting in:\\n\\n\u222b cos(t) e^t dt = e^t cos(t) - \u222b e^t sin(t) dt\\n\\nThe integral of e^t sin(t) can also be found using integration by parts and it results in e^t sin(t) - e^t cos(t) + C, but since we have an integral of cos(t) e^t, we don't need to compute this second step.\\n\\nSo, we have:\\n\\n\u222b cos(t) e^t dt = e^t cos(t) + C\\n\\nSubstituting back t = ln(x), we get:\\n\\n\u222b cos(ln(x)) dx = x cos(ln(x)) + C\\n\\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of sin(ln(x)) is:\\n\\n\u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = x * sin(ln(x)) - x * cos(ln(x)) + C\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\nf(4) = 4 * sin(ln(4)) - 4 * cos(ln(4))\\n\\nSince I can't calculate the exact value, I'll provide you with an approximation to find the integer part. sin(ln(4)) and cos(ln(4)) are transcendental numbers, but when we multiply them by 4 and subtract, we'll get a real number.
