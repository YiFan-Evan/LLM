[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x)).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-10'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: cos(x)*sinh(x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function cos(x) * sinh(x), we will use integration by parts. Let's denote u = cos(x) and dv = sinh(x)dx.

This is a bit trickier since it's not straightforward to integrate directly. However, since we're not required to find a closed-form expression for the integral of sin(x) * cosh(x), we can recognize that this integral will involve a combination of hyperbolic functions and trigonometric functions, which will not simplify nicely without further information or techniques.\\n\\nSince we only need the value of the indefinite integral at x = 4, we can use numerical integration techniques or a calculator to approximate the value of \u222b sin(x) * cosh(x) dx from 0 to 4, then subtract this from cos(4) * cosh(4).\\n\\nHowever, for the purpose of this problem, we're not actually required to find the exact integral of sin(x) * cosh(x), because we can use the fact that the original integral will have an x-dependent term that will disappear when we evaluate it at a specific point (x=4). The term involving the integral of sin(x) * cosh(x) will be a function of x that, when evaluated at x = 4, will not affect the integer part of the result due to the presence of the sine function, which oscillates between -1 and 1 and thus will not contribute to the integer part when multiplied by the hyperbolic cosine function, which is always positive.\\n\\nTherefore, we only need to evaluate cos(4) * cosh(4) at x = 4.
