[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Thus, the function becomes:\\n\\ncos(x) * x^(-1)\\n\\nNow, we can integrate this function. The integral of cos(x) is sin(x), but we also have to account for the x^(-1) term. We can use integration by parts or recognize that the integral of x^n * cos(x) is x^n * sin(x) - n * integral of x^(n-1) * sin(x), where n is the exponent of x.
