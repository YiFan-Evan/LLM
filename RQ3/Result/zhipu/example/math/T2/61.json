[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Multiplying by 5 gives us 5. The indefinite integral of a constant is the constant times x, so the indefinite integral of 5 is 5x + C. Substituting x = 4 into the result gives us 5*4 + C, which is 20 + C. Since we're only interested in the integer part and rounding down, the result is 20.\\n\\n20\""}]
