[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: x^2."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The indefinite integral of x^2 is (1/3)x^3. Substituting x=4 into the result gives (1/3)(4^3) = (1/3)(64) = 64/3. Rounding down 64/3 gives 21. \\n\\n21\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: x^2+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The indefinite integral of x^2 + x is (1/3)x^3 + (1/2)x^2. Substituting x=4 into the result gives (1/3)(4^3) + (1/2)(4^2) = (1/3)(64) + (1/2)(16) = 64/3 + 32/2 = 64/3 + 16. \\n\\nTo combine these, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case. So, 64/3 is equivalent to 128/6, and 16 is equivalent to 96/6. Adding these gives 128/6 + 96/6 = 224/6.\\n\\nNow, 224/6 = 37.333..., and rounding down gives 37.\\n\\n37\""}]
