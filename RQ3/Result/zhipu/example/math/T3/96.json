[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

However, we can express the indefinite integral in terms of a special function called the Fresnel integral. The Fresnel integral is denoted as C(x) and S(x) for the cosine and sine integrals, respectively.\\n\\nThe integral of cos(x^2) is given by:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x^2) dx = \u221a(\u03c0/2) C(x^2/2) + C\\n\\nNow, we are asked to evaluate this at x = 4:\\n\\n\u221a(\u03c0/2) C((4^2)/2) + C = \u221a(\u03c0/2) C(8) + C\\n\\nSince we are interested in the integer result of the expression by rounding down and we are excluding the constant C, we only need to calculate the value of the Fresnel integral C(8) and multiply it by \u221a(\u03c0/2).
