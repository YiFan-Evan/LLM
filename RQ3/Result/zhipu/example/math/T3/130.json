[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Let's denote u = ln(sin(x)) and dv = dx. Then, we have du = 1/sin(x) * cos(x) dx and v = x. Applying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222b ln(sin(x)) dx = x * ln(sin(x)) - \u222b x * (1/sin(x) * cos(x)) dx\\n\\nNow, we need to integrate the second term on the right side, which is a bit more complicated. We can rewrite it as:\\n\\n\u222b x * cot(x) dx\\n\\nThis integral can be solved using integration by parts again. Let u = x and dv = cot(x) dx. Then, du = dx and v = \u222b cot(x) dx = ln|sin(x)|. Applying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222b x * cot(x) dx = x * ln|sin(x)| - \u222b ln|sin(x)| dx\\n\\nHowever, we notice that we're back to the original integral, which means we have an infinite recursion. To solve this, we can express the integral in terms of the dilogarithm function Li2(x), which is defined as:\\n\\nLi2(x) = \u222b (-ln(1 - x)) / x dx\\n\\nFor our integral, the solution involving the dilogarithm function is:\\n\\n\u222b ln(sin(x)) dx = x * ln(sin(x)) - Li2(cos(x)) + C\\n\\nNow, we need to evaluate this expression at x = 4:\\n\\n4 * ln(sin(4)) - Li2(cos(4))\\n\\nHowever, since we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we can ignore the decimal part and only consider the integer part of the result. The dilogarithm function and the natural logarithm of sine will yield a non-integer result when calculated, so we would round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nPlease note that I cannot perform actual numerical calculations, but the integer part of the result can be found using a calculator or computational tool. Since I can't provide the exact integer result, I'll leave this step for you to calculate.
