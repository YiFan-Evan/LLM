The integral of ln(x) is a common integral to know, and it can be solved using integration by parts as follows:\\n\\nLet u = ln(x) and dv = (1/x)dx. Then, du = (1/x)dx and v = ln(x).\\n\\nNow, using the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe get:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) * (1/x) dx = ln(x) * ln(x) - \u222bln(x) * (1/x) dx\\n\\nThis results in an equation where the integral we're looking for is on both sides. To solve for it, we isolate the integral:\\n\\n2 * \u222bln(x) * (1/x) dx = ln(x) * ln(x)\\n\\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) * (1/x) dx = 1/2 * ln(x) * ln(x)\\n\\nHowever, we must also account for the fact that the original function can be rewritten as:\\n\\nln(x) * (1/x) = ln(x) * x^(-1)\\n\\nAnd the integral of x^(-1) is simply ln|x| (for x > 0). Since we are integrating ln(x), which is only defined for x > 0, we don't need the absolute value:\\n\\n\u222bx^(-1) dx = ln(x)\\n\\nSo the integral of the original function is:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) * (1/x) dx = 1/2 * ln^2(x) + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n1/2 * ln^2(4) + C\\n\\nSince we're not including the constant C and we're looking for the integer part by rounding down, we calculate:\\n\\n1/2 * (ln(4))^2\\n\\nFirst, find ln(4), which is approximately 1.38629436112.
