[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Let's denote u = sin(x) and dv = sinh(x)dx. Then, du = cos(x)dx and v = cosh(x).\\n\\nThe integration by parts formula is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nApplying this, we get:\\n\\n\u222bsin(x)*sinh(x)dx = sin(x)*cosh(x) - \u222bcos(x)*cosh(x)dx\\n\\nNow, we need to integrate cos(x)*cosh(x). This can be done by recognizing that d/dx (sinh(x)) = cosh(x), so we can write cos(x)*cosh(x)dx as d(sin(x)*sinh(x)) - sin(x)dsinh(x). The integral of cos(x)*cosh(x)dx is therefore sin(x)*sinh(x) - \u222bsin(x)dsinh(x).\\n\\nSince \u222bsin(x)dsinh(x) = \u222bsin(x)cosh(x)dx, we have a recursive situation, and we can't integrate this directly using simple substitution or parts.

However, since hyperbolic functions are not typically integrated using standard techniques from basic calculus, we'll use the fact that the derivative of cos(x)*cosh(x) is sin(x)*sinh(x) + cos(x)*cosh(x).
