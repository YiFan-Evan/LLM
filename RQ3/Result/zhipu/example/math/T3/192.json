[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Let's denote u = sin(x)/x and dv = dx/x. Then, du = (cos(x)/x - sin(x)/x^2)dx and v = ln|x|.\\n\\nUsing integration by parts, we have:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nSubstituting our u, dv, v, and du, we get:\\n\\n\u222b (sin(x)/x) dx/x = (sin(x)/x)ln|x| - \u222b ln|x| (cos(x)/x - sin(x)/x^2) dx\\n\\nNow, we need to integrate the second term, which is a bit more complicated.

However, the process is quite lengthy and involves special functions or a series expansion to get an exact form.\\n\\nFor the sake of this problem, we can use the fact that the integral of sin(x)/x^2 is related to the sine integral function Si(x), and the integral of cos(x)/x is related to the cosine integral function Ci(x).

Since you've asked for the integer part by rounding down, we would take the floor of that numerical result.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the integral, I'll use an approximation to find the integer result. Using software or a calculator to evaluate the integral and then substituting x = 4, we find that the integral of (1/x) * sin(x) / x from 0 to 4 is approximately -0.2765. Rounding down, the integer result is -1. \\n\\nSo the final answer is:\\n-1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)*sin(x)/x+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function (1/x) * sin(x)/x + x, we can integrate each term separately.\\n\\nThe first term (1/x) * sin(x)/x can be written as sin(x)/x^2, and the integral of sin(x)/x^2 is not an elementary function but involves the sine integral function Si(x), which is not expressible in terms of elementary functions.
