[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

We will again use integration by parts. Let's set u = 2ln(x) and dv = dx/x. Then, du = 2/x dx and v = ln(x).\\n\\n\u222b(x + 1) * 2ln(x)/x dx = 2\u222bln(x) d(x) - 2\u222bln(x) dx/x\\n= 2xln(x) - 2\u222bln(x)/x dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate \u222bln(x)/x dx, which is a known integral that equals (1/2)ln^2(x).\\n\\nPutting it all together, we have:\\n\\n\u222b(1+x)ln(x)ln(x)dx = (ln(x))^2(x + 1) - 2xln(x) + 2 * (1/2)ln^2(x) + C\\n= (ln(x))^2(x + 1) - 2xln(x) + ln^2(x) + C\\n= x(ln(x))^2 + ln^2(x) - 2xln(x) + C\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\\n\\n4(ln(4))^2 + ln^2(4) - 2*4ln(4) + C\\n= 4(2ln(2))^2 + (2ln(2))^2 - 8ln(2) + C\\n= 4(4ln^2(2)) + 4ln^2(2) - 8ln(2) + C\\n= 16ln^2(2) + 4ln^2(2) - 8ln(2) + C\\n= 20ln^2(2) - 8ln(2) + C\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this expression with the numerical value of ln(2), which is approximately 0.6931471805599453. However, since we want to provide the integer result by rounding down, we can skip the precise calculation and use the fact that ln(2) is slightly more than 0.69 to estimate that the result will be an integer close to 0, because the term 20ln^2(2) will be a bit more than 20*(0.69)^2, and -8ln(2) will be a bit less than -8*0.69, both of which are relatively small numbers that will not sum to an integer greater than 0 when added together.\\n\\nThus, without precise calculation, we can estimate that the result is 0 when x = 4. If you need the exact number, we would calculate it as follows:\\n\\n20*(0.6931471805599453)^2 - 8*0.6931471805599453 \u2248 20*0.48045 - 5.544117217719013 \u2248 9.609 - 5.544 \u2248 4.065\\n\\nRounding down, the integer result is 4.
