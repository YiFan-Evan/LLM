[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

The integral of x is straightforward, but the integral of e^x/sin(x) is not expressible in terms of elementary functions, as previously mentioned. However, we can still integrate x:\\n\\n\u222b x dx = (1/2)x^2\\n\\nFor the e^x/sin(x) part, since we can't find an exact indefinite integral, we'll leave it as an unevaluated integral:\\n\\n\u222b e^x/sin(x) dx\\n\\nNow we combine the two parts to get the indefinite integral of the entire function:\\n\\n\u222b (e^x/sin(x) + x) dx = \u222b e^x/sin(x) dx + \u222b x dx\\n                        = \u222b e^x/sin(x) dx + (1/2)x^2\\n\\nNext, we substitute x = 4 into the expression we have so far, keeping in mind that we'll leave the integral of e^x/sin(x) unevaluated:\\n\\n\u222b e^x/sin(x) dx + (1/2)(4)^2\\n= \u222b e^4/sin(4) dx + 8\\n\\nSince we cannot evaluate the integral of e^x/sin(x) at x = 4 exactly, we would typically use numerical methods to approximate the value.
