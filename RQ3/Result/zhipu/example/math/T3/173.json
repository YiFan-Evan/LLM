[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)/x/(1+x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To calculate the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)/x/(1+x), we first simplify the function:\\n\\n(1/x)/x/(1+x) = 1/(x^2(1+x))\\n\\nNow we integrate the function:\\n\\n\u222b 1/(x^2(1+x)) dx\\n\\nThis integral can be solved using partial fraction decomposition.
