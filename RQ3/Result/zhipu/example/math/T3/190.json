[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Let's use u = 1/x, so du = -1/x^2 dx, and dx = -x^2 du. When we substitute, the x in sinh((1/x)) * x will cancel with the x in dx, leaving us with:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(u) * (-x^2) du\\n\\nSince we're integrating with respect to u, the x^2 is treated as a constant, and we can take it out of the integral:\\n\\n-x^2 \u222bsinh(u) du\\n\\nThe integral of sinh(u) is cosh(u), so we have:\\n\\n-x^2 cosh(u) + C\\n\\nSubstituting back u = 1/x, we get:\\n\\n-x^2 cosh(1/x) + C\\n\\nNow we need to integrate the second term, which is simply x. The integral of x with respect to x is (1/2)x^2:\\n\\n(1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nCombining both parts, the indefinite integral of the original function is:\\n\\n-x^2 cosh(1/x) + (1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nNow we evaluate this at x = 4, ignoring the constant C:\\n\\n-4^2 cosh(1/4) + (1/2)4^2\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\n-16 cosh(1/4) + 8\\n\\nAgain, since we're only interested in the numerical result and we need to round down to the nearest integer, we don't need to consider the constant C. We calculate cosh(1/4) and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nUsing a calculator or software to find cosh(1/4) gives us a value approximately equal to 1.4624. Multiplying by -16 gives us approximately -23.3904. Adding 8 gives us approximately -15.3904. Rounding down, we get:\\n\\n-16\\n\\nSo the integer result of the expression when x = 4 is -16.\""}]
