[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

The integral of sinh(x) is cosh(x), but the denominator of 1/x complicates things. This is a case where we might need to use a substitution or integration by parts.\\n\\nThe integral of sinh(x)/(1/x) can be approached by using the substitution u = x^(-1), which gives du = -x^(-2)dx or dx = -x^2 du. However, this does not simplify the integral into a standard form. Instead, we can write the integral as:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)/(1/x)dx = \u222bsinh(x)*x dx\\n\\nThis suggests using integration by parts, where we take u = sinh(x) and dv = x dx. Then, du = cosh(x) dx and v = x^2/2.\\n\\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe get:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)*x dx = (sinh(x)*x^2/2) - \u222b(x^2/2)*cosh(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral of cosh(x) with respect to x is sinh(x), so we have:\\n\\n\u222b(x^2/2)*cosh(x) dx = (x^2/2)*sinh(x) - \u222bsinh(x)*x dx\\n\\nThis leads to an equation where the integral we're looking for is on both sides, which means we can't solve it directly. We need to use another method to integrate this function.\\n\\nLet's try a different substitution. If we let u = cosh(x), then du = sinh(x)dx. This substitution allows us to rewrite the integral in terms of u:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)/(1/x)dx = \u222bu/(1/x) * (1/du) dx\\n                 = \u222bx u du\\n                 = \u222bx cosh(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we can integrate x cosh(x) by parts again. Let's set u = x and dv = cosh(x)dx. Then du = dx and v = sinh(x). Using the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bx cosh(x) dx = x*sinh(x) - \u222bsinh(x) dx\\n              = x*sinh(x) - cosh(x) + C\\n\\nNow, we can substitute back x in terms of u:\\n\\nx*sinh(x) - cosh(x) + C = u*x - cosh(x) + C\\n                        = cosh(x)*x - cosh(x) + C\\n                        = x*cosh(x) - cosh(x) + C\\n                        = (x - 1)*cosh(x) + C\\n\\nNow we can substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n(4 - 1)*cosh(4) + C = 3*cosh(4) + C\\n\\nSince we are interested in the integer part of the result by rounding down, we don't need to include the constant C.
