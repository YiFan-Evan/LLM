[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x + C. When we substitute x=4 into the indefinite integral, we get e^4 + C. Since we're asked to round down to the nearest integer and we don't have the value of C, we can ignore it for the purpose of rounding because it will not affect the integer part of the result. \\n\\ne^4 is approximately 54.598.
