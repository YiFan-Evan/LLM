[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

This is a more complex integral, and it's not straightforward to integrate directly. However, it can be done using integration by parts again or by recognizing that the integral of e^x * tan(x) dx is a combination of e^x * tan(x) and e^x * sec(x) (which can be found through repeated integration by parts or by referring to integral tables).\\n\\nLet's denote the integral \u222b e^x * tan(x) dx as I.

So we have:\\n\\nI = e^x * tan(x) + I\\n\\nThis implies that 2I = e^x * tan(x), so I = 1/2 * e^x * tan(x).\\n\\nReturning to our original integration by parts result, we get:\\n\\n\u222b ln(cos(x)) * e^x dx = ln(cos(x)) * e^x + 1/2 * e^x * tan(x)\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\nln(cos(4)) * e^4 + 1/2 * e^4 * tan(4)\\n\\nCalculating this expression will give us a numerical result.
