[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The indefinite integral of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\ln|x| + C \\\\).\\n\\nSubstituting \\\\( x = 4 \\\\) into the indefinite integral gives us \\\\( \\\\ln|4| \\\\).\\n\\nSince \\\\( \\\\ln(4) \\\\) is approximately \\\\( 1.386 \\\\), rounding down gives us the integer result of 1. \\n\\n1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"1\""}]
