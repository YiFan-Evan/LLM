[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To calculate the indefinite integral of the function e^x, we use the integral of e^x, which is e^x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\nNow, we substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\ne^4 + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down and we are not given a specific value for C, we can ignore C for the purpose of this calculation as it will not affect the rounding down process.
