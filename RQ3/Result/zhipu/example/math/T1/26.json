[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

When we substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral, we get e^4 + C. Since we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down and we are not given the value of C, we can ignore C as it will not affect the integer part of the result. \\n\\nCalculating e^4, we get a value approximately equal to 54.598.
