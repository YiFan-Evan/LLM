[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Let's denote \\\\( u = e^x \\\\) and \\\\( dv = \\\\sin(x)dx \\\\).

This suggests that we have a situation where the integral of the function is related to the function itself. This can be solved by solving the equation:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int e^x \\\\cos(x) dx = e^x \\\\sin(x) - \\\\int e^x \\\\cos(x) dx\\n\\\\]\\n\\nLet \\\\( I = \\\\int e^x \\\\cos(x) dx \\\\).

Instead, we can estimate that \\\\( e^4 \\\\) is approximately 54.598, and the trigonometric functions will have values between -1 and 1. Even without exact values, it's clear that the result will be a negative number, and since we're rounding down, we can simply take the floor of \\\\( -4 \\\\times 54.598 \\\\), which is -219. \\n\\nTherefore, the integer result is -219.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x*sin(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"-2\""}]
