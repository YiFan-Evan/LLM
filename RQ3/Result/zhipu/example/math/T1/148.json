[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'e^x*sin(x)'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)*cos(x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)*cos(x), we'll use integration by parts. Let's denote u = cos(x) and dv = (1/x)dx.

This is a bit more complicated and requires another application of integration by parts. Let's set u = ln|x| and dv = sin(x)dx. Then, we get du = (1/x)dx and v = -cos(x).\\n\\nUsing integration by parts again:\\n\\n\u222bln|x|sin(x)dx = -ln|x|cos(x) + \u222bcos(x)(1/x)dx\\n\\nNow, \u222bcos(x)(1/x)dx is just the original integral we started with, so we'll call it I and we have:\\n\\n\u222bln|x|sin(x)dx = -ln|x|cos(x) + I\\n\\nNow going back to our original integral:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)*cos(x)dx = cos(x)ln|x| - (-ln|x|cos(x) + I)\\n\u222b(1/x)*cos(x)dx = cos(x)ln|x| + ln|x|cos(x) - I\\n2I = cos(x)ln|x| + ln|x|cos(x)\\nI = (1/2)(cos(x)ln|x| + ln|x|cos(x))\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this at x = 4:\\n\\nI(4) = (1/2)(cos(4)ln|4| + ln|4|cos(4))\\nI(4) = (1/2)(cos(4)*ln(4) + ln(4)*cos(4))\\nI(4) = cos(4)*ln(4)\\n\\nNow we take the integer part by rounding down:\\n\\nThe value of cos(4) is approximately -0.6536436239, and ln(4) is approximately 1.3862943611.
