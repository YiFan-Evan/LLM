[{"role": "user", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

The integral of e^(x^2) from 0 to 4 is approximately 123.41. Since we're looking for the integer part of the indefinite integral evaluated at x = 4, and not the definite integral from 0 to 4, we would consider the antiderivative's value at x = 4.\\n\\nIf we assume that the indefinite integral evaluated at x = 4 is close to this approximate definite integral value (which is not entirely accurate but serves as a rough estimate), and we round down, we would get 123 as the integer result.\\n\\nPlease note that this is an approximation and the actual result may vary slightly depending on the precise numerical integration method used. The exact integer result would require precise calculation tools.\""}]
