[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k < len(arr):\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = len(arr)\\n    while k > 0:\\n        k -= 1\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[k]->arr[len(arr)-1])'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    t = 0\n    while t < len(arr):\n        z = t + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[t]:\n                temp = arr[t]\n                arr[t] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        t += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"arr[t] = min(arr[t]->arr[len(arr)-1])\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[t]:\n                temp = arr[t]\n                arr[t] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There seems to be a mistake in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is used, but it is not defined within the snippet. Assuming that `i` is meant to be `t`, the corrected loop invariant for the i-th iteration, where `t` is the index of the current position being sorted, would be:\\n\\n\\\"arr[t] = max(arr[t]->arr[len(arr)-1])\\\"\\n\\nHowever, the code snippet also contains a logical error. The inner while loop should be iterating from the end of the array towards the beginning, comparing elements to find the maximum. But since the loop invariant is asking for the format 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', and assuming that the intent is to sort the array in ascending order, the correct loop invariant for the original intent of selection sort (with the corrected variable `t` instead of `i`) would be:\\n\\n\\\"arr[t] = max(arr[0]->arr[t-1])\\\" \\n\\nfor the outer loop, and for the inner loop invariant, it would be:\\n\\n\\\"arr[t] = max(arr[0]->arr[z])\\\" \\n\\nwhere `z` is the current index in the inner loop. But since we are asked for the i-th iteration, we would use `t` as the loop variable:\\n\\n\\\"arr[t] = max(arr[0]->arr[t])\\\" \\n\\nfor the outer loop, and\\n\\n\\\"arr[t] = max(arr[0]->arr[z])\\\" \\n\\nfor the inner loop.\""}]
