[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined within the function, and the loop that should be iterating over the array elements to perform the selection sort is not correctly implemented. Assuming you meant to use `z` as the iterating variable in the inner loop, here is a corrected version of the loop with a loop invariant:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    p = len(arr)\\n    while p > 0:\\n        min_index = 0\\n        for z in range(1, p):\\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\\n                min_index = z\\n        temp = arr[p-1]\\n        arr[p-1] = arr[min_index]\\n        arr[min_index] = temp\\n        p -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nWith this corrected code, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop would be:\\n\\n\\\"arr[0->arr[p-1]] is sorted and contains the same elements as the original array but possibly in a different order\\\"\\n\\nHowever, since you requested the answer in the specific format 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', here is an invariant in that format:\\n\\n\\\"min_index_value = min(arr[0->arr[p-1]])\\\"\\n\\nPlease note that the loop invariant for the inner loop would depend on the current state of `p` and would describe the minimum element found so far in the unsorted portion of the array.\""}]
