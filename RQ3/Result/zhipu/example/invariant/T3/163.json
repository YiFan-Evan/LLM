[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k < len(arr):\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = len(arr)\\n    while k > 0:\\n        k -= 1\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[k]->arr[len(arr)-1])'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = 0\n    while d < len(arr):\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        d += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[d-1])\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    d = len(arr)\n    while d > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        d -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There seems to be a mistake in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is not defined within the context of the function, and it is not used anywhere in the loop. Assuming that `i` was a typo and you meant to use `z` as the loop variable, the corrected loop invariant for the given code could be:\\n\\n\\\"partial_order_value = arr[0->d-1] is sorted\\\" \\n\\nHowever, since the format specified requires the use of `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, let's adapt it to the format while keeping in mind the purpose of the loop, which is to sort the array:\\n\\n\\\"sorted_value = is_sorted(arr[0]->arr[d])\\\"\\n\\nThis invariant states that the subarray from the start to the current value of `d` (exclusive) is sorted. Note that the condition `d > 0` ensures that the loop eventually terminates, and `is_sorted` is a conceptual function that represents the property of being sorted.\""}]
