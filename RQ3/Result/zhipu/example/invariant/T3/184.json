[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined in the while loop, and it appears that the variable `z` should iterate over the elements to find the minimum value, which should be compared with `arr[e]`. Assuming the intention is to sort the array in ascending order using selection sort, the corrected loop and the corresponding loop invariant could be as follows:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    e = len(arr) - 1\\n    while e > 0:\\n        max_index = e\\n        for z in range(e):\\n            if arr[z] > arr[max_index]:\\n                max_index = z\\n        temp = arr[e]\\n        arr[e] = arr[max_index]\\n        arr[max_index] = temp\\n        e -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nFor this corrected code, the loop invariant for the `e`-th iteration would be:\\n\\n\\\"max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[e])\\\" \\n\\nHowever, since the original code snippet provided is incorrect, I will provide the loop invariant based on the assumption that `z` should iterate from `e` down to `1` (inclusive):\\n\\n\\\"max_value = max(arr[e]->arr[0])\\\" \\n\\nThis invariant states that during each iteration of the outer loop, `arr[e]` holds the maximum value of the unsorted portion of the array (`arr[e]->arr[0]`).\""}]
