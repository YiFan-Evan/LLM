[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k < len(arr):\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = len(arr)\\n    while k > 0:\\n        k -= 1\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[k]->arr[len(arr)-1])'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    c = 0\n    while c < len(arr):\n        z = c + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[c]:\n                temp = arr[c]\n                arr[c] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        c += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[c])\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    c = len(arr)\n    while c > 0:\n        c -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[c]:\n                temp = arr[c]\n                arr[c] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There seems to be a mistake in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is not defined within the context of the code. Assuming that `i` was meant to be `c` (since `c` is the loop variable decremented in the outer loop), the loop invariant for the i-th (or in this case, c-th) iteration of the outer loop could be stated as follows:\\n\\n\\\"sorted_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[c])\\\"\\n\\nHowever, this does not match the required format exactly, as it uses the `sorted` function, which is not allowed in the specified format. Instead, we should describe the state of the array after each iteration. A more appropriate loop invariant for the outer loop, following the specified format, would be:\\n\\n\\\"partial_min_value = min(arr[c]->arr[len(arr)-1])\\\"\\n\\nThis invariant states that the minimum value in the unsorted portion of the array (from index `c` to the end of the array) has been found and placed at the beginning of the unsorted portion after `c` iterations of the outer loop. Note that the inner loop is responsible for this operation.\""}]
