[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined within the context of the code. Assuming that `z` should be the iterating variable in the inner while loop and that the intent is to sort the array in ascending order, the corrected loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be:\\n\\n\\\"sorted_part_value = sorted(arr[h]->arr[len(arr)-1])\\\"\\n\\nHowever, since the outer loop is iterating with `h` decreasing, and the inner loop is iterating with `z` decreasing, the invariant should reflect the portion of the array that has been sorted correctly at each iteration. Thus, the loop invariant would be:\\n\\n\\\"sorted_part_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[h])\\\" \\n\\nfor the i-th iteration, where `h` is the current value of the loop control variable in the outer loop.\""}]
