[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The variable `i` is not defined within the function, and the second while loop should iterate over the elements before `g` to perform the selection sort correctly. Assuming the intention is to correct the code and provide a loop invariant for the original (corrected) selection sort algorithm, here is the loop invariant for the first while loop in the corrected version of the code:\\n\\n\\\"selection_sort_value = sorted(arr[0->g]) and unsorted(arr[g+1->len(arr)-1])\\\"\\n\\nHowever, since the format specified requires the invariant to be in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', and considering the corrected code, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i = g` in this context) would be:\\n\\n\\\"selection_sort_value = min(arr[g+1->len(arr)-1])\\\"\\n\\nFor the second while loop, which seems to be incorrectly written, if we correct it to iterate from `g-1` down to `0`, the loop invariant would be:\\n\\n\\\"selection_sort_value = min(arr[0->g]) when z = i and unsorted(arr[i->g-1]) when z > i\\\"\\n\\nBut since the format requires only one statement without additional text, and considering the corrected code, the loop invariant for the second while loop at the i-th iteration would be:\\n\\n\\\"selection_sort_value = min(arr[0->g-1])\\\" \\n\\nThis assumes that `z` is iterating from `g-1` down to `0`. If the intention was to keep the original code as is, the loop invariant cannot be accurately described in the specified format because the code does not perform a correct sorting operation.\""}]
