[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined within the context of the function. Assuming that `i` was meant to be `o` (since it's used in the same way as the loop control variable in the first part of the loop), and correcting the loop to reflect a standard selection sort algorithm, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be:\\n\\n\\\"min_value = min(arr[o+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])\\\"\\n\\nThis invariant holds after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, indicating that the smallest value from `arr[o+1]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]` has been moved to the `arr[o]` position. Note that I've adjusted the loop invariant to reflect the corrected variable `o` and the typical behavior of the selection sort algorithm.\""}]
