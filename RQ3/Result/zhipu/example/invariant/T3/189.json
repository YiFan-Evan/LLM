[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = 0\\n    while k < len(arr):\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n        k += 1\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[k-1])'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'def give_sum(arr):\\n    sum_value = 0\\n    k = len(arr)\\n    while k > 0:\\n        k -= 1\\n        sum_value += arr[k]\\n    return sum_value'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'sum_value = sum(arr[k]->arr[len(arr)-1])'}])"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    j = 0\n    while j < len(arr):\n        z = j + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[j]:\n                temp = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        j += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[j-1])\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    j = len(arr)\n    while j > 0:\n        j -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[j]:\n                temp = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There seems to be a mistake in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is used in the second while loop, but it is neither defined within the loop nor is it related to the loop's logic. Assuming that the intention was to use the variable `z` in both loops, the corrected code would look like this:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    j = len(arr)\\n    while j > 0:\\n        j -= 1\\n        z = j - 1\\n        while z >= 0:\\n            if arr[z] < arr[j]:\\n                temp = arr[j]\\n                arr[j] = arr[z]\\n                arr[z] = temp\\n            z -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nEven with the correction, the loop invariant for the outer loop at the i-th iteration (where `i = len(arr) - j`) could be stated as:\\n\\n\\\"min_value = min(arr[i+1->arr[len(arr)-1]])\\\"\\n\\nHowever, since the corrected code does not have a variable `i` and uses `j` instead, the loop invariant for the j-th iteration would be:\\n\\n\\\"min_value = min(arr[j+1->arr[len(arr)-1]])\\\" \\n\\nPlease note that this assumes the corrected version of the code and that the inner loop is correctly iterating from `j-1` down to `0`. If the original code snippet is meant to be correct as is, the loop invariant would not be well-defined because of the undefined variable `i`.\""}]
