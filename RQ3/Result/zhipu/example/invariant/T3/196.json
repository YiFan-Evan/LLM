[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The variable `i` is not defined within the context of the code, and the loop that should perform the selection sort is not correctly implemented. However, assuming you want the loop invariant for the standard selection sort algorithm where `q` is the last index of the unsorted portion of the array and `z` is used to find the minimum element in the unsorted portion, the corrected code and the loop invariant would be:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    q = len(arr) - 1\\n    while q > 0:\\n        min_index = q\\n        for z in range(q):\\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\\n                min_index = z\\n        temp = arr[q]\\n        arr[q] = arr[min_index]\\n        arr[min_index] = temp\\n        q -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nThe loop invariant for this corrected code would be:\\n\\\"arr[0->q] is sorted and contains the same elements as the original arr[0->q]\\\" after the `q-th` iteration. However, since you requested the answer in the specified format and only the invariant statement, here it is:\\n\\n\\\"arr[0->q] = sorted(arr[0->q])\\\" \\n\\nPlease note that in the original code snippet you provided, `z` is decremented from `i` to `0`, which is not correct for selection sort and would result in an infinite loop or an index error. The corrected version above assumes a standard selection sort algorithm.\""}]
