[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is used in the inner while loop, but it is not defined within the context of the loop. Assuming that `i` is meant to be `b` (to maintain the structure of a selection sort algorithm), the corrected loop invariant for the outer loop, when the loop is at the i-th iteration (with `b` being the index and `b = len(arr) - i`), would be:\\n\\n\\\"arr[b] = max(arr[b->len(arr)-1])\\\"\\n\\nHowever, since the condition in the if statement checks if `arr[z] < arr[b]` and swaps the elements, it suggests that we are actually looking for the minimum element to place at the beginning of the unsorted portion of the array. Therefore, the correct loop invariant should reflect that we are finding the minimum element in the unsorted portion:\\n\\n\\\"arr[b] = min(arr[b->len(arr)-1])\\\"\""}]
