[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined within the function; it should likely be `c` to match the variable used in the outer loop.

But to strictly adhere to the format and considering `c` as the loop variable for the outer loop, the correct loop invariant for the c-th iteration of the outer loop would be:\\n\\n`arr[0]->arr[c] = sorted(arr[0]->arr[c])` \\n\\nPlease note that this invariant is slightly imprecise because it states that the subarray up to index `c` is sorted, but it should actually be up to index `c-1` since the sorting process involves comparing the current element at index `c` with the sorted portion of the array up to index `c-1`. A more accurate invariant would be:\\n\\n`arr[0]->arr[c-1] = sorted(arr[0]->arr[c-1])`\""}]
