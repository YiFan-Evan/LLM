However, since I can't execute code, I'll describe the steps you would take to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a priority queue and insert the starting node (6) with a distance of 0.\\n2. Set the distance of all other nodes to infinity.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   - Extract the node with the smallest distance.\\n   - For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through the current node.\\n   - If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue with the new distance.\\n4. Once the destination node (4) is reached, backtrack through the recorded paths to find the shortest path.\\n\\nAfter performing these steps, the shortest path from node 6 to node 4 is found to be: 6->21->5->3->4\\n\\nSo the answer is: 6->21->5->3->4\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 12], [2, 14], [2, 17], [2, 18], [2, 24], [3, 4], [3, 24], [5, 21], [6, 21], [7, 21], [8, 24], [9, 19], [9, 16], [10, 24], [11, 12], [11, 23], [11, 19], [13, 19], [15, 19], [16, 24], [18, 21], [19, 20], [20, 22]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"4->3->24->2->17->14->12->0->1->6\""}]
