[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Therefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop would be:\\n\\n`arr[0->z] = fun(arr[0->z])` \\n\\nwhere `z` is the current index in the inner loop. However, since the format requires `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, and we are not provided with a variable `xxx_value`, we can interpret this to mean the entire segment of the array from `0` to `z` should be described. Thus, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop, considering the format specified, is:\\n\\n`arr[0->z] = sorted(arr[0->z])`\\n\\nThis indicates that the subarray from index `0` to `z` is sorted after each iteration of the inner loop.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `insertion_sort` function with the loop variable `r` initialized to `-1` and incremented to `len(arr) - 1`, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer while loop (considering that `r` is the loop variable) can be written as:\\n\\n`arr[0->r] = sorted(arr[0->r])`\\n\\nNow, for the inner while loop, with `z` being the current index and considering the format `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop would be:\\n\\n`arr[0->z] = sorted(arr[0->z])`\\n\\nHowever, since the question asks for the loop invariant for the i-th iteration with the loop variable changed to its original value minus one, which means we are considering the state of the array right before the i-th iteration of the inner loop, we would adjust `z` to `z+1`.
