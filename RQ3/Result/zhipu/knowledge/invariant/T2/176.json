[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

However, since the loop variable starts at -1 and is incremented to 0 at the first iteration, the first iteration actually corresponds to the 0-th iteration in a zero-based index sense. So the correct invariant for the i-th iteration, where i starts at 0, would be:\\n\\n`i_value = sorted(arr[0]->arr[i])`\""}]
