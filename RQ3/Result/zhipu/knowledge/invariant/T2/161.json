The insertion sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted part and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the outer while loop (with loop variable `b`) can be stated as:\\n\\n`0 <= b_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[b-1]) <= len(arr)`\\n\\nNow, let's provide a loop invariant for the inner while loop (with loop variable `z`):\\n\\n`arr[z_value] = fun(arr[z]->arr[z-1])`\\n\\nHowever, the specified format requires the invariant to be written with the array indices in the form `xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])`. Since the loop invariant must hold before the first iteration of the inner loop and after the last iteration, for the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the invariant for the inner loop should be:\\n\\n`arr[1_value] = fun(arr[1]->arr[i])`\\n\\nwhere `i` is the current value of `b` at the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nPlease note that in the original code provided, there is a mistake: the variable `i` is not defined. The correct loop should use `b` as the loop variable for the inner loop as well, or `i` should be defined elsewhere in the function.

To adhere to the specified format and considering the loop variable `b` has been changed to its original value minus one, the loop invariant for the outer loop should reflect the state of the array before the first increment of `b`. The loop invariant should state that the subarray from index `0` to `b` (inclusive) is sorted.\\n\\nHere is the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop, where `b` has been incremented `i` times:\\n\\n`arr[0_value] = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nFor the inner loop, we need to express the loop invariant for each iteration of the inner loop, which processes the elements to ensure the subarray `arr[0...b]` is sorted. The variable `i` is not defined in the given code snippet, so it's assumed that `b` is the correct variable to use for the inner loop as well. The loop invariant for the inner loop at the i-th iteration (of the outer loop) would be:\\n\\n`arr[b_value] = fun(arr[b]->arr[b-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after the inner loop finishes for a particular `b`, the subarray `arr[0...b]` is sorted.\""}]
