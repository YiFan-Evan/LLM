[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined before it's used in the while loop. Assuming this is a typo and the variable intended to be used is `o`, the loop invariant for the `i-th` (or `o-th` in this context) iteration of the first while loop in the insertion sort algorithm can be stated as:\\n\\n`arr[0->o] = fun(arr[0->o])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the subarray from index 0 to index `o` is sorted after `o` iterations of the outer while loop.
