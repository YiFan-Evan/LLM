[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, even if the loop condition changes from < len to <= len - 1, the loop invariant should remain unchanged.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The loop invariant for the `insertion_sort` function can be stated as:\\n\\n`0 <= i <= e and arr[0...i-1] is sorted and arr[i...len(arr)-1] has all elements >= arr[i-1]` \\n\\nHowever, since the format specified requires the statement to be in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we need to adapt the invariant to fit that format. A possible adaptation could be:\\n\\n`arr[0...i-1]_sorted_value = sorted(arr[0...i-1])` \\n\\nfor the outer loop, but this doesn't fit the required format exactly because it refers to a slice of the array rather than a single element. Unfortunately, the specified format does not seem suitable for describing the invariant of a sorting algorithm like insertion sort, as invariants typically describe properties of the array as a whole or a section of it, not transformations between individual elements. However, if we were to strictly adhere to the format and describe a property of a single element in relation to its position before the sort, we might say:\\n\\n`arr[i-1]_position_value = correct_position(arr[i-1], arr[0...i-1])`\\n\\nHere, `correct_position` would be an abstract function that ensures the element is in its correct place relative to the sorted part of the array. This is a very unconventional way to express a loop invariant, and it doesn't capture the full meaning of the actual invariant, but it does follow the specified format.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated in the specified format as:\\n\\n`arr[0...i]_sorted_value = sorted(arr[0...i])`\\n\\nHowever, since the format strictly requires a statement in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', and considering that the loop variable `e` is used to track the boundary of the sorted portion of the array, the loop invariant can be adapted to:\\n\\n`arr[0...e]_sorted_value = sorted(arr[0...e-1])`\\n\\nfor each iteration where `e` is the current value of the loop control variable.
