Since the specified format is unusual for describing a loop invariant and doesn't fit the typical structure of such invariants, it's challenging to adapt it directly without additional context. If we strictly follow the format and assume `m` is meant to be `i`, the closest we can get might be:\\n\\n`arr[0...i]_sorted_value = is_sorted(arr[0...i]->arr[0...i])`\\n\\nHowever, this still doesn't match the specified format exactly because `is_sorted` is not a transformation of the array elements but rather a property of the array segment.
