Assuming that the intention is to start sorting from the second element of the array (index 1) and move towards the end, the loop should be corrected by initializing `i` to `1` before the inner while loop. However, since you've asked for a loop invariant in the specific format and without modifying the original code, I will provide an invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop with the assumption that `i` is meant to be `n` (which is the actual loop variable in this code snippet).\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop, following the format you've requested, would be:\\n\\n```\\narr[0->n]_sorted_value = sorted(arr[0->n])\\n```\\n\\nThis invariant states that the subarray from index `0` to `n` is sorted after each iteration of the outer loop.
