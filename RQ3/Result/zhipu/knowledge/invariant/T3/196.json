[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined in the function, and the inner while loop should iterate over the array elements to be compared with `arr[q]`. Assuming the intention was to reverse the selection sort algorithm to iterate from the end to the beginning, here's the corrected code with an appropriate loop invariant for the original selection sort algorithm ( iterating from the beginning to the end):\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    q = 0\\n    while q < len(arr):\\n        max_index = q\\n        for z in range(q+1, len(arr)):\\n            if arr[z] > arr[max_index]:\\n                max_index = z\\n        arr[q], arr[max_index] = arr[max_index], arr[q]\\n        q += 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nAnd here is the loop invariant for the corrected version of the selection sort algorithm:\\n\\n\\\"arr[0]->arr[q] = fun(arr[0]->arr[q-1]->arr[q]->arr[q])\\\"\\n\\nHowever, if you want the loop invariant for the original code snippet you provided (with the mistake corrected for clarity), which sorts the array in reverse order, the loop invariant would be:\\n\\n\\\"arr[0]->arr[q] = fun(arr[1]->arr[q]->arr[0]->arr[q])\\\"\\n\\nPlease note that in this case, `q` starts at `len(arr)` and decrements down to `0`. The inner loop also decrements `z` from `q-1` down to `0`. The invariant should reflect the state of the array after each iteration of the outer loop.\""}]
