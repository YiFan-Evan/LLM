[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, if the loop is changed to iterate from the end to the beginning, the array index in the loop invariant should be adjusted to the latter part.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    r = 0\n    while r < len(arr):\n        z = r + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[r]:\n                temp = arr[r]\n                arr[r] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        r += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"`min_value = fun(arr[0->r-1]->arr[r])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    r = len(arr)\n    while r > 0:\n        r -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[r]:\n                temp = arr[r]\n                arr[r] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"It seems there is a mistake in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is not defined in the given context. Assuming that you intended to use `r` in the while loop condition and you want the loop to iterate from the end to the beginning, here's the corrected loop invariant for the given selection sort algorithm:\\n\\n\\\"`min_value = fun(arr[r+1->len(arr)-1]->arr[r])`\\\" \\n\\nHowever, please note that the inner while loop should iterate over the range from `r-1` down to `0` (not `r`), because `z` is meant to iterate through the elements before `r` to find the smallest one. So the corrected code should look like this:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    r = len(arr)\\n    while r > 0:\\n        r -= 1\\n        z = r - 1\\n        while z >= 0:\\n            if arr[z] < arr[r]:\\n                temp = arr[r]\\n                arr[r] = arr[z]\\n                arr[z] = temp\\n            z -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nAnd the loop invariant for the corrected code would be:\\n\\n\\\"`min_value = fun(arr[r+1->len(arr)-1]->arr[r])`\\\"\""}]
