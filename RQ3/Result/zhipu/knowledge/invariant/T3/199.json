[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined within the function, and the loop that should iterate over the array is not correctly implemented. Assuming you want to correct the code and provide a loop invariant for a descending order selection sort that iterates from the end to the beginning, the corrected code and the loop invariant would be:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    t = len(arr) - 1\\n    while t > 0:\\n        max_idx = t\\n        for z in range(t):\\n            if arr[z] > arr[max_idx]:\\n                max_idx = z\\n        temp = arr[t]\\n        arr[t] = arr[max_idx]\\n        arr[max_idx] = temp\\n        t -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nAnd the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` is the index of the current outer loop iteration) would be:\\n\\n\\\"`max_value = max(arr[i->len(arr)-1])`\\\" \\n\\nHowever, since you asked for the format 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', here is the adjusted format:\\n\\n\\\"`max_value = max(arr[i->len(arr)-1])`\\\"\\n\\nPlease note that in the corrected code, I've replaced the incorrect `while z > 0` loop with a `for z in range(t)` loop for clarity and correctness, and I've used `max_idx` to track the index of the maximum value found so far.\""}]
