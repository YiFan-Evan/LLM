[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined within the function; it should be `z` which is used in the inner while loop. Assuming the variable `i` is a typo and it should be `z`, here is the loop invariant for the i-th (or in this case, z-th) iteration of the inner while loop:\\n\\n`arr[0->z-1] = fun(arr[0->z-2]->arr[z-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that after each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray from index 0 to `z-1` is sorted. The function `fun` would conceptually represent the property of being sorted or ordered correctly. \\n\\nPlease note that the outer loop invariant would describe the sorted state of the array up to the `l`-th element from the start, but since we are asked for the loop invariant of the inner loop and in the specified format, the above statement is appropriate. If the loop were to iterate from the end to the beginning, the loop invariant would be adjusted accordingly to reflect the state of the subarray from the end towards the beginning.\""}]
