The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is used but not defined within the function, and the loop that should perform the selection sort is not correctly implemented. Assuming you meant for the variable `z` to be initialized correctly and to iterate from the end of the array towards the beginning, the corrected code and the corresponding loop invariant for the reverse selection sort would look like this:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    f = len(arr) - 1\\n    while f > 0:\\n        max_idx = f\\n        for z in range(f):\\n            if arr[z] > arr[max_idx]:\\n                max_idx = z\\n        temp = arr[f]\\n        arr[f] = arr[max_idx]\\n        arr[max_idx] = temp\\n        f -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nFor the corrected reverse selection sort, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` is the index of the last element in the unsorted portion of the array) would be:\\n\\n\\\"arr[0]->arr[i-1] = fun(arr[0]->arr[i]->arr[0]->arr[i])\\\" \\n\\nThis invariant states that after each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray from index 0 to i-1 contains the same elements as the original array but in sorted order, and the elements from i to the end of the array have not been altered yet. Note that the format you've asked for is a bit unconventional for describing loop invariants, as typically, loop invariants are more descriptive and not in the functional form you've specified.\""}]
