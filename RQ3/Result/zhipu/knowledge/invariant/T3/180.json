[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined within the function, and the loop that should iterate over the array is using `z` decreasing from `a` to `0`, which is not correct for selection sort. Selection sort should iterate from the start of the array to the end, and within each iteration, find the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and swap it with the element at the current position.\\n\\nHere's the corrected version of the loop from the original selection sort algorithm, with the loop iterating from the end to the beginning, and the loop invariant for the i-th iteration:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    a = len(arr) - 1\\n    while a > 0:\\n        min_index = a\\n        for z in range(a):\\n            if arr[z] < arr[min_index]:\\n                min_index = z\\n        # Swap the found minimum element with the last element in the unsorted part\\n        temp = arr[a]\\n        arr[a] = arr[min_index]\\n        arr[min_index] = temp\\n        a -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nFor the corrected loop, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` is the current value of `a` in the original forward version of the loop) would be:\\n\\n\\\"`min_value = fun(arr[0->i-1]->arr[i])`\\\"\\n\\nHowever, since the loop is iterating backward, we should adjust the indices accordingly. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration (with `a` being the current index in the backward loop) would be:\\n\\n\\\"`min_value = fun(arr[a+1->len(arr)-1]->arr[a])`\\\" \\n\\nNote that the invariant expresses that the minimum value has been found for the subarray from `a+1` to the end of the array, and it will be placed at index `a` after the current iteration.\""}]
