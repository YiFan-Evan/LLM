[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined in the loop, and the loop structure is incorrect for a reverse selection sort. Assuming you meant to provide a reverse selection sort algorithm and the loop should iterate from the end to the beginning, here is the corrected code with the loop invariant:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    s = len(arr) - 1\\n    while s > 0:\\n        max_index = s\\n        for z in range(s):\\n            if arr[z] > arr[max_index]:\\n                max_index = z\\n        temp = arr[s]\\n        arr[s] = arr[max_index]\\n        arr[max_index] = temp\\n        s -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nAnd the loop invariant for this corrected code would be:\\n\\\"`arr[0->s] = sorted(arr[0->len(arr)-1])`\\\" for the i-th iteration, where `s` is the current value of the loop control variable at the start of the i-th iteration. However, since the loop invariant should be in the specified format and considering the original intent of the question, here it is:\\n\\n\\\"`arr[s+1->len(arr)-1] = sorted(arr[s+1->len(arr)-1])`\\\"\""}]
