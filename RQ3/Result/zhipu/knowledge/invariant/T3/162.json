[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined within the context of the function. Assuming the loop should iterate over the array from the end to the beginning, and the variable `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1` before the while loop, the corrected code and the loop invariant could be as follows:\\n\\n```python\\ndef insertion_sort(arr):\\n    c = len(arr)\\n    i = c - 1  # Assuming `i` should be initialized here\\n    while c > 0:\\n        z = i\\n        while z < len(arr) - 1 and arr[z] > arr[z + 1]:\\n            temp = arr[z]\\n            arr[z] = arr[z + 1]\\n            arr[z + 1] = temp\\n            z += 1\\n        c -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nWith this correction, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration would be:\\n\\n`\\\"arr[i+1->len(arr)-1] = sorted(arr[i+1->len(arr)-1])\\\"`\""}]
