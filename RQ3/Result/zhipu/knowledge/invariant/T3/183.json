[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, if the loop is changed to iterate from the end to the beginning, the array index in the loop invariant should be adjusted to the latter part.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    d = 0\n    while d < len(arr):\n        z = d + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[d]:\n                temp = arr[d]\n                arr[d] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        d += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"`arr[0->d-1] = sorted(arr[0->d-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    d = len(arr)\n    while d > 0:\n        d -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[d]:\n                temp = arr[d]\n                arr[d] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There seems to be a mistake in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is not defined within the function, and the loop that should perform the selection sort is not correctly implemented. Assuming you meant to have `z` starting from `d-1` and going down to `0`, here's how the corrected loop invariant would look for the original selection sort algorithm, modified to iterate from the end to the beginning:\\n\\n`arr[d->len(arr)-1] = sorted(arr[d->len(arr)-1])`\\n\\nHowever, since the variable `i` is not present in the provided code and there's no decrementing loop for `d`, I'll provide the loop invariant for the typical selection sort algorithm that decrements `d` and assumes the inner loop starts from `d-1` and goes down to `0`:\\n\\n`arr[0->d-1] = sorted(arr[0->d-1])`\""}]
