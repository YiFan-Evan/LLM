[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Assuming that `i` was meant to be `j`, and considering the loop is iterating from the end to the beginning, here is the loop invariant in the specified format:\\n\\n\\\"`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[j])`\\\"\\n\\nThis invariant would express that during each iteration, the minimum value is found between the start of the array and the current index `j`, and it's being placed at the position `j`.
