[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined in the given context. Assuming you meant to use `m` instead of `i`, and considering the loop should iterate from the end to the beginning, a corrected version of the code and a loop invariant could be:\\n\\n```python\\ndef selection_sort(arr):\\n    m = len(arr) - 1\\n    while m > 0:\\n        max_index = m\\n        for z in range(m):\\n            if arr[z] > arr[max_index]:\\n                max_index = z\\n        temp = arr[m]\\n        arr[m] = arr[max_index]\\n        arr[max_index] = temp\\n        m -= 1\\n    return arr\\n```\\n\\nFor this corrected version, a loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` is the current value of `m`) could be:\\n\\n\\\"arr[i] = fun(arr[0]->arr[i-1])\\\" \\n\\nHowever, since the format you specified requires the indices to be adjusted to the latter part (when iterating from end to beginning), the loop invariant would be:\\n\\n\\\"arr[i+1] = fun(arr[i+2]->arr[len(arr)-1])\\\" \\n\\nfor the i-th iteration of the outer loop, where `i` is the current index before decrementing `m`.\""}]
