[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined within the context of the code. Assuming you meant to use the loop variable `l` inside the inner while loop, here is the corrected loop invariant for the original selection sort algorithm modified to iterate from the end to the beginning:\\n\\n\\\"`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1])`\\\"\\n\\nHowever, since the inner loop also iterates backwards (`z -= 1`), the loop invariant should reflect the current state of the minimum value found in the subarray `arr[0:l]` after each iteration:\\n\\n\\\"`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1-z])`\\\"\\n\\nBut since the invariant should hold at the start of each iteration of the outer loop, and `z` is initialized to `l` and decremented down to 1, the correct invariant at the start of each outer loop iteration (when `z` is about to be decremented from `l` to `l-1`) would be:\\n\\n\\\"`min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[l-1])`\\\"\\n\\nThis states that the minimum value is found within the unsorted portion of the array from index 0 to `l-1`.\""}]
