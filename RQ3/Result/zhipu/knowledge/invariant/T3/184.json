[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, if the loop is changed to iterate from the end to the beginning, the array index in the loop invariant should be adjusted to the latter part.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e < len(arr):\n        z = e + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[e]:\n                temp = arr[e]\n                arr[e] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"`min_value = fun(arr[0->e-1]->arr[0->e-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    e = len(arr)\n    while e > 0:\n        e -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[e]:\n                temp = arr[e]\n                arr[e] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"It seems there is a mistake in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is not defined within the function. Assuming you meant to use `e` instead of `i`, and considering that the loop is iterating from the end to the beginning, the loop invariant for the corrected code would be:\\n\\n\\\"`min_value = fun(arr[e+1->len(arr)-1]->arr[e+1->len(arr)-1])`\\\"\\n\\nHowever, since the variable `z` is not correctly used (it should iterate from `e-1` down to `0`), I will adjust the loop invariant based on the intended behavior of the loop, assuming the code is meant to sort the array in descending order:\\n\\n\\\"`max_value = fun(arr[0->e-1]->arr[0->e-1])`\\\"\\n\\nThis invariant assumes that after each iteration of the outer loop, the largest element in the unsorted portion of the array (`arr[0->e-1]`) has been moved to its correct position at the end of the array (`arr[e-1]`).\""}]
