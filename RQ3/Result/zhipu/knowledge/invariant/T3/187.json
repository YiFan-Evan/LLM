[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The variable `i` is not defined within the function. Assuming you meant to use `h` instead of `i`, and considering that the loop is iterating from the end to the beginning, here's the loop invariant for the corrected code:\\n\\n\\\"min_value = fun(arr[h]->arr[h-1-z])\\\"\\n\\nHowever, if the loop is iterating correctly with `h` and not `i`, and starting from the end of the array and moving towards the beginning, the loop invariant would be:\\n\\n\\\"min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[h-1])\\\" after the first iteration of the outer loop and before the second iteration begins, where `h` is the current value of the loop control variable at the start of the outer loop iteration. For each iteration of the inner loop, the invariant holds as well, but the specific expression for `z` would change depending on the current iteration.\""}]
