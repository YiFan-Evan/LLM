[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, if the loop is changed to iterate from the end to the beginning, the array index in the loop invariant should be adjusted to the latter part.)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    g = 0\n    while g < len(arr):\n        z = g + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[g]:\n                temp = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        g += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"arr[g-1]->arr[g] = min(arr[0]->arr[g-1])\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    g = len(arr)\n    while g > 0:\n        g -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[g]:\n                temp = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There seems to be a typo in the provided code snippet. The variable `i` is used in the second while loop, but it is not defined within the function. I assume you meant to use `g` instead of `i`. Assuming that's the correction, here's the loop invariant for the loop iterating from the end to the beginning:\\n\\n\\\"arr[g+1]->arr[len(arr)-1] = min(arr[g+1]->arr[len(arr)-1])\\\" \\n\\nHowever, since the loop is iterating backward and swapping elements when `arr[z] < arr[g]`, the loop invariant should actually reflect that the largest element found so far has been moved to the correct position at the end of the unsorted portion of the array. Here is the corrected loop invariant:\\n\\n\\\"arr[0]->arr[g] = sorted(arr[0]->arr[g])\\\" \\n\\nFor each iteration of the outer loop, the invariant states that the subarray from index 0 to g (exclusive) is sorted. After each inner loop iteration, the largest element in the unsorted subarray (from g+1 to len(arr)-1) is moved to its correct position at index g.\""}]
