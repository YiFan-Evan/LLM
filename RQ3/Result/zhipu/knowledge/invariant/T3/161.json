[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Assuming the intention was to use the variable `b` inside the inner while loop as well (to correct the code), and considering the loop is iterating from the end to the beginning, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer while loop (with `b` as the loop variable) would be:\\n\\n`arr[0->b-1]_sorted = sorted(arr[0->b-1])`\\n\\nHowever, since the loop is iterating backward, we need to adjust the loop invariant to reflect this.
