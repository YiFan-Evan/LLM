[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)' without any additional text.(Notice that if the conclusion of a reasoning process happens to be a premise in a new reasoning process, the previous reasoning can incorporate this new condition to derive a new conclusion.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Everything that is brown, blue, or a tumpus is a dumpus.

From the premises, we know that Max is a tumpus (6) and that Max is a sterpus (7).

Once we establish that Max is a lorpus, we can use premise (2) which states that everything that is a lorpus is a gorpus, but since we don't need to prove Max is a gorpus, this isn't our goal.\\n\\nUnfortunately, none of the premises directly connect a tumpus or a sterpus to being luminous or wooden.
