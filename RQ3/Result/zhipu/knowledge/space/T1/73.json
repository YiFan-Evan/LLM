Moving 9 steps counterclockwise from the gondola (which is at the top), we would circle back around to the same position we started from (the gondola) after 10 steps, and then continue counterclockwise for the remaining 9 - 10 = -1 step, which is equivalent to 9 steps clockwise from the gondola.\\n\\n9 steps clockwise from the gondola would bring you to the agaric.\\n\\nTherefore, the item you find after all these movements is:\\n\\n\\\"agaric\\\"\""}]
