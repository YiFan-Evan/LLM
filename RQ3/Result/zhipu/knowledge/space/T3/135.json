Since the path has 20 dots, moving around the entire circle is equivalent to moving 20 steps in either direction.\\n\\nStarting from the Asian elephant, the movements are as follows:\\n\\n1. Move 30 steps clockwise.\\n2. Move 38 steps counter-clockwise.\\n3. Move 14 steps clockwise.\\n4. Move 30 steps clockwise.\\n\\nLet's calculate the net movement:\\n\\n1. 30 steps clockwise from the Asian elephant lands you at the Miniature Schnauzer.\\n2. 38 steps counter-clockwise from the Miniature Schnauzer takes you back to the Asian elephant and then 18 more steps counter-clockwise, landing you at the Irish Terrier.\\n3. 14 steps clockwise from the Irish Terrier lands you at the tabby cat.\\n4. 30 steps clockwise from the tabby cat lands you at the Asian elephant again.\\n\\nNow, let's calculate the net effect of these movements:\\n\\n- Moving 30 steps clockwise and then 38 steps counter-clockwise results in a net movement of 8 steps counter-clockwise.\\n- Adding the 14 steps clockwise and another 30 steps clockwise results in a net movement of 44 steps clockwise.\\n\\nCombining these, we have a net movement of 44 - 8 = 36 steps clockwise.\\n\\nSince 36 steps clockwise is equivalent to 1 full circle (20 steps) plus 16 steps, we can find the item by moving 16 steps clockwise from the Asian elephant:\\n\\n1.
