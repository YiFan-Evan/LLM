The total number of steps moved counter-clockwise is 34 + 10 = 44 steps.\\n\\nSince the path is circular and has 20 dots, moving 44 steps counter-clockwise from the minibus would bring us back to the starting point (the minibus), because 44 is twice the number of dots on the path (20 * 2 = 40, and 44 - 40 = 4 steps, which would be 4 steps clockwise from the minibus, bringing us back to the minibus).\\n\\nNow, we subtract the counter-clockwise steps from the clockwise steps to find the net movement: 30 (clockwise) - 44 (counter-clockwise) = -14 steps. Since we're moving in a circular path, we can add 20 (the number of dots) to the negative steps to find the equivalent positive steps in the clockwise direction: -14 + 20 = 6 steps clockwise.\\n\\nStarting from the minibus and moving 6 steps clockwise, we pass the water buffalo and the jack-o'-lantern, and land on the computer mouse.\\n\\nThe item you find is \\\"computer mouse\\\".\""}]
