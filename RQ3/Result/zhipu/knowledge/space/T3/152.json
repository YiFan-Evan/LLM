Since there are 20 items in total, we can calculate the position by adding 28 to the position of the photocopier (which we can consider as the 15th position since the list starts with the monarch butterfly at the top, making the photocopier the 15th item):\\n\\n15 (photocopier's position) + 28 steps = 43rd position\\n\\nHowever, since the path is circular, we need to find the equivalent position within the 20-item loop. We do this by subtracting 20 from 43 until we get a number less than 20:\\n\\n43 - 20 = 23\\n23 - 20 = 3\\n\\nSo, after 28 steps, you would be at the 3rd position, which is the \\\"vase.\\\"\\n\\nNext, from the vase, you move 12 steps clockwise:\\n\\n3 (vase's position) + 12 steps = 15th position\\n\\nThe 15th position on the list is the \\\"military cap.\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, after moving 28 steps and then 12 steps from the photocopier, you will find a \\\"military cap.\\\"\""}]
