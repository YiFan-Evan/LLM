Since the path is circular and has 20 dots, moving 36 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 16 steps clockwise (because 36 - 20 = 16). Starting from the umbrella and moving 16 steps clockwise, we pass the following items:\\n\\n1. doormat\\n2. megalith\\n3. police van\\n4. Egyptian Mau\\n5. football helmet\\n6. toy terrier\\n7. Polaroid camera\\n8. three-toed sloth\\n9. teapot\\n10. hermit crab\\n11. chainsaw\\n12. chain\\n13. great white shark\\n14. Komodo dragon\\n15. sunglass\\n16. desk\\n\\nSo after 36 steps counter-clockwise, we end up at the desk.\\n\\nNext, we move an additional 4 steps counter-clockwise from the desk.
