However, we need to find the position after the first 12 steps.\\n\\nTo do this, we can calculate the position after 12 steps counter-clockwise from the African bush elephant. Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we subtract the steps from the current position:\\n\\nThe African bush elephant is the 9th item on the list. Subtracting 12 from 9 gives us:\\n\\n9 - 12 = -3\\n\\nSince we can't have a negative position on the circular path, we add 20 (the total number of dots) to find the equivalent positive position:\\n\\n-3 + 20 = 17\\n\\nThe 17th item on the list is the eastern diamondback rattlesnake.\\n\\nItem found: eastern diamondback rattlesnake\""}]
