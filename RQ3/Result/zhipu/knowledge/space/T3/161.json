Move 2 steps counter-clockwise: This takes you to the Hummingbird.\\n2. Move 12 steps clockwise from the Hummingbird: This takes you to the Military Aircraft.\\n3. Move 38 steps clockwise from the Military Aircraft: Since there are 20 items on the path, we can calculate the position by taking the total steps modulo 20 (38 % 20). This gives us 18, which means we move 18 steps from the Military Aircraft. Counting 18 steps clockwise from the Military Aircraft lands you on the Horizontal Bar.\\n4. Move 34 steps clockwise from the Horizontal Bar: Again, we use modulo 20 to find the position (34 % 20), which gives us 14.
