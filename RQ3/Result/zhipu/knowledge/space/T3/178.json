However, because the path has 20 dots and we are considering a circular movement, we can simplify the calculation by using modulo arithmetic with the number of dots (20) as the modulus.\\n\\n(-20) mod 20 = 0 (because -20 + 20 = 0, which is equivalent to no movement)\\n\\nSo, after the total movement, we end up at the starting point, which is the European polecat.\\n\\nThe item found is \\\"European polecat\\\".\""}]
