Let's denote u = ln(x) and dv = e^(-x)dx. Then, we have du = 1/x dx and v = -e^(-x) (since the integral of e^(-x)dx is -e^(-x)).\\n\\nUsing the integration by parts formula, which is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe get:\\n\\n\u222bln(x)/e^x dx = ln(x)(-e^(-x)) - \u222b(-e^(-x))(1/x) dx\\n               = -ln(x)e^(-x) + \u222be^(-x)/x dx\\n\\nThe integral \u222be^(-x)/x dx is a special function known as the exponential integral, denoted as Ei(x), and cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, since we are not asked to find the closed-form expression but rather to evaluate the integral at a specific point, we can use numerical methods to approximate this integral if necessary.\\n\\nBut since we are interested in the integer result after substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we can focus on the term that involves the natural logarithm and the exponential function.

We already know from the previous problem that the integral of ln(x)/e^x is not expressible in terms of elementary functions, but since we are interested in the integer part of the result after substituting 'x=4', we can focus on the simpler term x, which is straightforward to integrate.\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of x with respect to x is (1/2)x^2.\\n\\nNow, let's integrate the function term by term:\\n\\n\u222b[ln(x)/e^x + x] dx = \u222bln(x)/e^x dx + \u222bx dx\\n\\nWe will leave the integral of ln(x)/e^x as it is, since we cannot express it in elementary functions, and it will not affect the integer part of the result when evaluated at x=4.
