Let's substitute u = ln(x), then du = dx/x and dx = x du. The integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = \u222b sin(u) x du\\n\\nSince we have x du = dx, we can rewrite the integral as:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) x du = \u222b sin(u) e^u du\\n\\nNow we can integrate sin(u)e^u using integration by parts.
