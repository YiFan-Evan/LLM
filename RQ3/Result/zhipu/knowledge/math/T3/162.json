As previously mentioned, this term does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. However, since we're only asked to provide an integer result after substituting 'x=4' into the indefinite integral, we can use numerical methods to approximate the integral of \\\\( \\\\frac{e^x}{x \\\\sin(x)} \\\\) from 0 to 4 and then subtract the result from \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{2}x^2 \\\\) evaluated at 4.\\n\\nLet's denote \\\\( I \\\\) as the integral of \\\\( \\\\frac{e^x}{x \\\\sin(x)} \\\\) from 0 to 4. We will not compute \\\\( I \\\\) exactly but will consider it in the context of the problem.\\n\\nThe indefinite integral of the entire function is then:\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\left( \\\\frac{e^x}{x \\\\sin(x)} + x \\\\right) dx = I + \\\\frac{1}{2}x^2 + C \\\\]\\n\\nSubstituting \\\\( x = 4 \\\\) into the indefinite integral, we get:\\n\\\\[ I + \\\\frac{1}{2}(4)^2 + C = I + 8 + C \\\\]\\n\\nSince we're looking for the integer part of the result, and we're not given a value for \\\\( C \\\\), we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer part. So we only need to consider \\\\( I + 8 \\\\).\\n\\nNow, because we don't have an exact value for \\\\( I \\\\), we can't give an exact integer result. However, the problem statement includes a special instruction that if the integrand of the latter is the former plus \\\\( x \\\\), then the result after integration should differ by \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{2}x^2 \\\\).

Since we cannot determine the exact value of \\\\( I \\\\), we will assume that \\\\( I \\\\) is such that \\\\( I + 8 \\\\) is the nearest integer to \\\\( I \\\\) when considering the special instruction. Therefore, we will round down \\\\( I + 8 \\\\) to the nearest integer.\\n\\nSince we don't have the exact value of \\\\( I \\\\), we cannot provide a single integer number as the final result.
