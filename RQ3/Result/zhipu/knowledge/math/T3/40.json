Let's substitute u = cos(x), so du = -sin(x) dx or dx = -du/sin(x).\\n\\nThe integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b e^cos(x) dx = \u222b e^u (-du/sin(x))\\n\\nHowever, since we're integrating with respect to u, we need to express sin(x) in terms of u. We know that sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, so sin^2(x) = 1 - cos^2(x) = 1 - u^2. Therefore, sin(x) = sqrt(1 - u^2), but since we're integrating e^u, the sign of sin(x) doesn't matter as it will be canceled out by the negative sign in front of du.\\n\\nSo the integral simplifies to:\\n\\n\u222b e^u (-du) = -\u222b e^u du\\n\\nThis is a simple exponential integral, and the antiderivative of e^u is e^u. Thus, we have:\\n\\n-\u222b e^u du = -e^u + C\\n\\nNow we substitute back u = cos(x):\\n\\n-e^cos(x) + C\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this expression at x = 4:\\n\\n-e^cos(4) + C\\n\\nSince we're asked to round down to the nearest integer, we don't need to calculate the exact value of C.

Since the exponential function grows very quickly, e^cos(4) will be significantly larger than 1, making -e^cos(4) significantly smaller than -1.
