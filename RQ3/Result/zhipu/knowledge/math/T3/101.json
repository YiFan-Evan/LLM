Let's denote u = sinh(x), then du = cosh(x) * dx. However, cos(x) is not directly related to cosh(x), so we need a different approach.\\n\\nWe can use the identity that sinh(x) * cos(x) can be rewritten using the hyperbolic cosine function:\\n\\nsinh(x) * cos(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / 2 * cos(x)\\n\\nNow let's integrate:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x) * cos(x) dx = \u222b(e^x - e^(-x)) / 2 * cos(x) dx\\n\\nWe can split this into two integrals:\\n\\n= 1/2 \u222be^x * cos(x) dx - 1/2 \u222be^(-x) * cos(x) dx\\n\\nThese are not simple integrals, but we can use integration by parts for each of them. For the first integral, let's use u = e^x and dv = cos(x) dx. Then, du = e^x dx and v = sin(x). Applying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222be^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) - \u222bsin(x) * e^x dx\\n\\nWe need to integrate sin(x) * e^x again, so we use integration by parts a second time, with u = e^x and dv = sin(x) dx. Then, du = e^x dx and v = -cos(x). Applying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222bsin(x) * e^x dx = -e^x * cos(x) + \u222bcos(x) * e^x dx\\n\\nNow we substitute this back into our original integral:\\n\\n\u222be^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) - (-e^x * cos(x) + \u222bcos(x) * e^x dx)\\n                   = e^x * sin(x) + e^x * cos(x) - \u222bcos(x) * e^x dx\\n\\nWe see that the integral \u222bcos(x) * e^x dx appears on both sides, so we can solve for it:\\n\\n2 * \u222bcos(x) * e^x dx = e^x * sin(x) + e^x * cos(x)\\n\u222bcos(x) * e^x dx = (e^x * sin(x) + e^x * cos(x)) / 2\\n\\nNow we can integrate the second part of our original expression in a similar way:\\n\\n\u222be^(-x) * cos(x) dx = -e^(-x) * sin(x) - \u222bsin(x) * e^(-x) dx\\n\\nAgain, we integrate by parts for the second integral:\\n\\n\u222bsin(x) * e^(-x) dx = -e^(-x) * cos(x) - \u222bcos(x) * e^(-x) dx\\n\\nSubstituting this back:\\n\\n\u222be^(-x) * cos(x) dx = -e^(-x) * sin(x) - (-e^(-x) * cos(x) - \u222bcos(x) * e^(-x) dx)\\n                      = -e^(-x) * sin(x) + e^(-x) * cos(x) + \u222bcos(x) * e^(-x) dx\\n\\nWe can solve for \u222bcos(x) * e^(-x) dx as we did before:\\n\\n2 * \u222bcos(x) * e^(-x) dx = -e^(-x) * sin(x) + e^(-x) * cos(x)\\n\u222bcos(x) * e^(-x) dx = (-e^(-x) * sin(x) + e^(-x) * cos(x)) / 2\\n\\nNow we can combine the results for both integrals:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x) * cos(x) dx = 1/2 \u222be^x * cos(x) dx - 1/2 \u222be^(-x) * cos(x) dx\\n                      = 1/2 * (e^x * sin(x) + e^x * cos(x) - e^(-x) * sin(x) - e^(-x) * cos(x))\\n\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x) * cos(x) dx = 1/2 * (e^x * (sin(x) + cos(x)) - e^(-x) * (sin(x) + cos(x)))\\n\\nNow we can substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n= 1/2 * (e^4 * (sin(4) + cos(4)) - e^(-4) * (sin(4) + cos(4)))\\n\\nSince we are looking for the integer part of the result, we can calculate this expression and round down to the nearest integer.
