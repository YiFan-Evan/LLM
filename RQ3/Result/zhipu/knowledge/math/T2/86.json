However, this is a bit tricky because we have a product of functions that are not easily integrated directly. A common strategy is to use a substitution that transforms the integral into one that can be solved using standard techniques.\\n\\nLet's start with integration by parts, setting:\\n- \\\\( u = e^x \\\\) so that \\\\( du = e^x dx \\\\),\\n- \\\\( dv = \\\\frac{dx}{\\\\cos(x)} \\\\) so that \\\\( v = \\\\ln |\\\\sec(x) + \\\\tan(x)| \\\\) (this is the integral of \\\\( \\\\sec(x) \\\\)).\\n\\nNow, applying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int \\\\frac{e^x}{\\\\cos(x)} dx = uv - \\\\int v du\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSubstitute \\\\( u \\\\), \\\\( du \\\\), \\\\( v \\\\), and \\\\( dv \\\\) into the equation:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int \\\\frac{e^x}{\\\\cos(x)} dx = e^x \\\\ln |\\\\sec(x) + \\\\tan(x)| - \\\\int \\\\ln |\\\\sec(x) + \\\\tan(x)| e^x dx\\n\\\\]\\n\\nThe second integral is quite complex and does not have a simple antiderivative, so we need to look for another approach. A useful substitution here is \\\\( u = \\\\tan(\\\\frac{x}{2}) \\\\), which leads to \\\\( dx = \\\\frac{2}{1 + u^2} du} \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\cos(x) = \\\\frac{1 - u^2}{1 + u^2} \\\\). This substitution is known as the Weierstrass substitution and it converts the trigonometric integral into an algebraic one.\\n\\nUsing this substitution, the integral becomes:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int \\\\frac{e^x}{\\\\cos(x)} dx = \\\\int \\\\frac{e^x}{\\\\frac{1 - u^2}{1 + u^2}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{2}{1 + u^2} du\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSimplifying, we get:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\int \\\\frac{2e^x}{1 - u^2} du\\n\\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\( x = 2 \\\\arctan(u) \\\\), we can express \\\\( e^x \\\\) in terms of \\\\( u \\\\), but this integral is still not straightforward to solve directly. Instead, we can recognize that the integral of \\\\( e^x \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) is \\\\( e^x \\\\), and we need to deal with the denominator which is \\\\( \\\\cos(x) \\\\).
