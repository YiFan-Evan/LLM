Let's denote u = 1/x and dv = e^x dx. Then, we have du = -1/x^2 dx and v = e^x.\\n\\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nWe get:\\n\\n\u222b (1/x)*e^x dx = (1/x)*e^x - \u222b e^x*(-1/x^2) dx\\n\\nNow, integrate the second term:\\n\\n\u222b -e^x/x^2 dx\\n\\nThis integral is not straightforward, but we can recognize it as a derivative of a function involving e^x divided by x. Specifically, it's the derivative of -e^x/x with respect to x. So, we can integrate this directly:\\n\\n\u222b -e^x/x^2 dx = e^x/x + C\\n\\nCombining this with our first result, we have:\\n\\n\u222b (1/x)*e^x dx = (1/x)*e^x + e^x/x + C\\n\\nSince both terms have e^x/x in common, we can combine them:\\n\\n\u222b (1/x)*e^x dx = (1 + 1/x)*e^x + C\\n\u222b (1/x)*e^x dx = (x + 1)/x * e^x + C\\n\\nNow, let's substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n((4 + 1)/4) * e^4 + C = (5/4) * e^4 + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to round down to the nearest integer, we can ignore the constant C as it will not affect the integer part of the result. Now, we only need to calculate (5/4) * e^4 and round down.\\n\\nCalculating (5/4) * e^4 gives us a non-integer value. To find the nearest integer, we round down:\\n\\n(5/4) * e^4 \u2248 (5/4) * 54.598 \u2248 68.8735\\n\\nRounding down, we get the integer result:\\n\\n68\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1/x)*e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The function given is 5 times the previous function (1/x)*e^x. Since the integral of a constant multiple of a function is the constant multiple of the integral of the function, we can simply take 5 times the integral we found earlier and then substitute x = 4 into the result.\\n\\nFrom the previous calculation, we had:\\n\\n\u222b (1/x)*e^x dx = (x + 1)/x * e^x + C\\n\\nNow, we multiply this result by 5:\\n\\n\u222b 5*(1/x)*e^x dx = 5 * ((x + 1)/x * e^x) + C\\n\u222b 5*(1/x)*e^x dx = 5 * (x + 1)/x * e^x + C\\n\\nSubstituting x = 4 into this expression:\\n\\n5 * (4 + 1)/4 * e^4 + C = 5 * (5/4) * e^4 + C\\n\\nAgain, we ignore the constant C for the integer part of the result.
