Let's start by splitting the integral into two parts: one with the (1+x) term and another with just the ln(x)*ln(x) term.\\n\\nThe integral of (1+x)*ln(x)*ln(x) dx can be written as:\\n\\n\u222b (1+x)*ln(x)*ln(x) dx = \u222b ln(x)*ln(x) dx + \u222b x*ln(x)*ln(x) dx\\n\\nLet's integrate each part separately.\\n\\nFor the first part, let's use u = ln(x) and dv = ln(x) dx. Then, du = 1/x dx and v = (1/2)ln^2(x) (since the integral of ln(x) dx is (1/2)ln^2(x)).\\n\\nUsing integration by parts, we have:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x)*ln(x) dx = u*v - \u222b v*du\\n                   = (ln(x))*(1/2)ln^2(x) - \u222b (1/2)ln^2(x)*(1/x) dx\\n                   = (1/2)ln^3(x) - (1/2)\u222b ln^2(x)/x dx\\n\\nFor the second part, we can use integration by parts again, but this time let's use u = ln(x) and dv = x*ln(x) dx. To integrate dv, we can treat x as a constant and integrate ln(x), which gives us (1/2)xln^2(x) for v. The derivative of v, dv, is then ln(x) + x*(1/x) = ln(x) + 1.\\n\\nNow, we have:\\n\\n\u222b x*ln(x)*ln(x) dx = u*v - \u222b v*du\\n                    = (ln(x))*(1/2)xln^2(x) - \u222b (1/2)xln^2(x)*(1/x) dx - \u222b (1/2)x dx\\n                    = (1/2)xln^3(x) - (1/2)\u222b xln^2(x)/x dx - (1/2)\u222b x dx\\n                    = (1/2)xln^3(x) - (1/2)\u222b ln^2(x) dx - (1/2)(1/2)x^2\\n                    = (1/2)xln^3(x) - (1/2)(1/2)x^2 - (1/2)(1/3)ln^3(x)\\n                    = (1/2)xln^3(x) - (1/4)x^2 - (1/6)ln^3(x)\\n\\nCombining both parts, we have:\\n\\n\u222b (1+x)*ln(x)*ln(x) dx = (1/2)ln^3(x) - (1/2)(1/3)ln^3(x) + (1/2)xln^3(x) - (1/4)x^2 - (1/6)ln^3(x)\\n                        = (1/2)xln^3(x) - (1/4)x^2 - (1/3)ln^3(x)\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n(1/2)*4*ln^3(4) - (1/4)*4^2 - (1/3)ln^3(4)\\n= 2ln^3(4) - 4 - (1/3)ln^3(4)\\n= (6/3)ln^3(4) - (1/3)ln^3(4) - 4\\n= (5/3)ln^3(4) - 4\\n\\nTo find the integer result by rounding down, we need to calculate this expression and round down to the nearest integer.
