Let's substitute u = 1/x, so du = -1/x^2 dx, which means dx = -x^2 du. However, since we are dealing with 1/x, we can simplify this to dx = -du/u^2 by canceling out the x^2 from both sides.\\n\\nNow the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x)/(1/x) dx = \u222b sin(x) * x dx\\n\\nWe substitute u for 1/x and du for -dx/u^2:\\n\\n= \u222b sin(x) * u^2 * (-du)\\n= -\u222b u^2 * sin(x) du\\n\\nBut we still have sin(x) in terms of x, not u. To integrate this expression, we need to express sin(x) in terms of u. Since u = 1/x, x = 1/u, and we can find sin(1/u) if we needed to, but in this case, we don't need to because the integral of sin(x) with respect to x is simply -cos(x).\\n\\nSo, the integral of sin(x) with respect to x is -cos(x), and we can integrate as follows:\\n\\n= -\u222b sin(x) dx\\n= -(-cos(x)) + C\\n= cos(x) + C\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\ncos(4) + C\\n\\nSince we're only interested in the numerical result and not the constant C, and because we need to round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\ncos(4) \u2248 -0.6536 (using a calculator)\\nRounding down, we get -1.\\n\\nThe final result is -1.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sin(x)/(1/x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Given the function 5 * (sin(x)/(1/x)), we can follow a similar process as before to integrate the function.
