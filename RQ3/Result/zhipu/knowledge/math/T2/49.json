However, since we are interested in the value of the integral at a specific point (x = 4) and rounding down to the nearest integer, we can simply multiply the final result of the previous integration by 5 before rounding down.\\n\\nFrom the previous explanation, we had the indefinite integral of ln(x) * sin(x) up to the point where we needed to evaluate the integral of cos(x) / x from 1 to 4. Since we don't have the exact value of that integral, let's denote it as I, such that:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) * sin(x) dx from 1 to 4 = -4 * cos(4) + I\\n\\nNow, for the function 5 * (ln(x) * sin(x)), the integral from 1 to 4 would be:\\n\\n5 * \u222bln(x) * sin(x) dx from 1 to 4 = 5 * (-4 * cos(4) + I) = -20 * cos(4) + 5I\\n\\nTo find the integer result, we would need to calculate the value of I and then apply the formula. Since I can't calculate I, I'll provide the final formula to use once you have the value of I:\\n\\nFinal result = floor(-20 * cos(4) + 5I)\\n\\nWithout the exact value of I, we cannot provide a single integer number as the answer.
