Integration by parts is based on the product rule for differentiation and is given by:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u = ln(x) and dv = 1/sin(x) dx. Then, we need to find du and v.\\n\\ndu/dx = 1/x, so du = 1/x dx\\n\\nTo find v, we integrate dv:\\n\\n\u222b1/sin(x) dx = -ln|csc(x) + cot(x)| + C (where C is a constant of integration)\\n\\nNow we apply integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222bln(x)/sin(x) dx = ln(x) * (-ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|) - \u222b(-ln|csc(x) + cot(x)|) * (1/x) dx\\n\\nHowever, this integration is quite complex and doesn't lead to a simple result. To simplify the process, let's use a substitution to make it more manageable. We'll use the substitution u = ln(x), so du = 1/x dx, and the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222bu/sin(e^u) du\\n\\nNow we can apply integration by parts with u as the first function and 1/sin(e^u) du as the differential of the second function. This will lead to an integral involving the hyperbolic sine function, sinh(u), which is beyond the scope of basic calculus and doesn't seem to yield a simple elementary function.\\n\\nGiven that we're looking for an integer result by rounding down after substituting 'x=4', and considering the complexity of the integral, it's not feasible to perform this integration by hand without the use of advanced techniques or computational tools.\\n\\nTherefore, to proceed with the problem as stated, we would need to use numerical methods or a computer algebra system to find the integral and then evaluate it at x=4. Since this is not possible within the constraints of this format, I cannot provide the integer result as requested.
