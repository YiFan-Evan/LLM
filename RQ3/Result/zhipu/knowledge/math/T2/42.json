The denominator can be factored as x(1+x), and we look for constants A and B such that:\\n\\n1/(x(1+x)) = A/x + B/(1+x)\\n\\nTo find A and B, we multiply both sides by x(1+x) to clear the denominators:\\n\\n1 = A(1+x) + Bx\\n\\nNow, we solve for A and B by choosing values for x that simplify the equation:\\n\\nIf x = 0, we get:\\n1 = A(1+0) + B(0)\\n1 = A\\nSo, A = 1.\\n\\nIf x = -1, we get:\\n1 = A(1-1) + B(-1)\\n1 = -B\\nSo, B = -1.\\n\\nNow we have the partial fraction decomposition:\\n1/(x(1+x)) = 1/x - 1/(1+x)\\n\\nWe can integrate each term separately:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x dx) - \u222b(1/(1+x) dx)\\n\\nThe integral of 1/x is ln|x| + C1, and the integral of 1/(1+x) is ln|1+x| + C2.

However, since ln(4/5) is a negative number and rounding down will not yield an integer, the expression itself will not yield an integer when evaluated.
