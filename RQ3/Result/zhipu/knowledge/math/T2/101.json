Let's recall the definitions of sinh(x) and cos(x):\\n\\nsinh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / 2\\ncos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix)) / 2\\n\\nHowever, using these definitions directly to integrate would be complicated. Instead, we'll use a trigonometric identity or recognize a pattern that allows us to integrate the function more easily.\\n\\nThe product of hyperbolic sine and cosine can be written as:\\n\\nsinh(x) * cos(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / 2 * (e^(ix) + e^(-ix)) / 2\\n\\nThis doesn't simplify the integral directly. Instead, we can use the fact that the derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x), and the derivative of -sin(x) is -cos(x). We notice that the product sinh(x) * cos(x) is similar to the derivative of the product cosh(x) * sin(x) except for a sign change and a factor of i.\\n\\nLet's use the substitution u = cos(x), then du = -sin(x)dx. Our integral now becomes:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x) * cos(x)dx = \u222bsinh(x)(-du/dx)dx = -\u222bsinh(x)du\\n\\nNow, since the derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x), we can write sinh(x)du as d(cosh(x)). Thus, the integral becomes:\\n\\n-\u222bd(cosh(x)) = -cosh(x) + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n-cosh(4) + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to round down to the nearest integer and C is the constant of integration, it will not affect the rounding, so we can ignore it for the purpose of finding the integer result:\\n\\n floor(-cosh(4))\\n\\nFirst, let's calculate cosh(4). cosh(x) is the hyperbolic cosine function, which is defined as (e^x + e^(-x)) / 2. We can calculate cosh(4) using a calculator:\\n\\ncosh(4) \u2248 (e^4 + e^(-4)) / 2\\n\\nNow, we take the negative of this value and round down to the nearest integer. Since I can't use a calculator in this environment, I'll provide the steps you would take:\\n\\n1. Calculate e^4 and e^(-4).\\n2. Add these two values together.\\n3. Divide by 2 to get cosh(4).\\n4. Take the negative of cosh(4).\\n5. Round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nPlease use a calculator to perform these calculations.

We already found the integral of sinh(x) * cos(x) to be -cosh(x) + C. Therefore, the integral of 5 * sinh(x) * cos(x) is:\\\\n\\\\n-5 * cosh(x) + C\\\\n\\\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of this indefinite integral:\\\\n\\\\n-5 * cosh(4) + C\\\\n\\\\nAgain, we can ignore the constant C for the purpose of finding the integer result.

Multiplying by -5 gives approximately -136.541195, and rounding down gives us the integer result of -137.\\\\n\\\\nSo the final result is -137.\\\"\""}]
