We just need to know that artanh(4) is a real number, and since we're asked to round down, we'll consider the integer part of artanh(4) when evaluated at x = 4.\\n\\nNow, because the second integral does not have a simple antiderivative and we're only interested in the integer part of the result, we can ignore it for the purpose of this problem.
