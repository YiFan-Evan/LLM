Let's set u = sin(x), so du = cos(x) dx. However, we have sin(x) dx in the numerator, not cos(x) dx. To get du, we need to divide by cos(x), which will give us dx = du/cos(x). But since our original integrand has sin(x) dx and not just dx, we need to multiply by sin(x)/cos(x) to get our substitution to work. This is actually the derivative of cos(sin(x)), so our substitution will be exact.\\n\\nThe integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x)/cos(sin(x)) dx = \u222b u/\u221a(1-u^2) du\\n\\nThis is a standard form for a trigonometric substitution.
