The integral of (1+x)/ln(x) is not straightforward and does not have a simple elementary antiderivative. However, we can integrate each term separately with respect to x, recognizing that the integral of 1/ln(x) is Li(x), the logarithmic integral function, and the integral of x/ln(x) requires integration by parts.\\n\\nLet's integrate (1+x)/ln(x):\\n\\n\u222b (1+x)/ln(x) dx = \u222b 1/ln(x) dx + \u222b x/ln(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral of 1/ln(x) is Li(x) + C1, where C1 is a constant.\\n\\nFor the second integral, we use integration by parts with u = x and dv = 1/ln(x) dx. Then, du = dx and v = Li(x), because the integral of 1/ln(x) with respect to x is Li(x).\\n\\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222b x/ln(x) dx = uv - \u222b v du\\n               = x Li(x) - \u222b Li(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral of Li(x) does not have a simple elementary form, but we can leave it as is for now.
