Let's set u = e^x, then du/dx = e^x, and dx = du/e^x. However, because we have e^x in the argument of the sine function, we can directly substitute u = e^x and du = e^x dx. The integral then becomes:\\n\\n\u222b sin(e^x) dx = \u222b sin(u) (du/e^x)\\n\\nSince e^x dx = du, the e^x term cancels out, leaving us with:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) du\\n\\nThe integral of sin(u) is -cos(u), so the indefinite integral of sin(e^x) with respect to x is:\\n\\n-\u222b cos(u) du = -cos(u) + C = -cos(e^x) + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n-\u222b cos(e^x) + C with x = 4 becomes -cos(e^4) + C\\n\\nSince we're only interested in the numerical result and not the constant C, we can ignore it for the purpose of this calculation.
