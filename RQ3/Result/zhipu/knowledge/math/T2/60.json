Let's denote the hyperbolic sine function sinh(x) as (e^x - e^(-x))/2. Therefore, the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x)/sinh(x) dx = \u222b sin(x) / ((e^x - e^(-x))/2) dx\\n\\nWe can simplify this by multiplying the numerator and denominator by 2 to get rid of the fraction:\\n\\n= 2 * \u222b sin(x) / (e^x - e^(-x)) dx\\n\\nNow, let's use the substitution u = cosh(x) = (e^x + e^(-x))/2. The derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = sinh(x), so dx = du/sinh(x).\\n\\nSubstituting this into the integral, we get:\\n\\n= 2 * \u222b sin(x) / (2sinh(x)) * (2du/sinh(x))\\n\\n= \u222b sin(x) du\\n\\nNow, since u = cosh(x), sin(x) dx can be written as -du in this context, because d(cosh(x)) = sinh(x) dx and the integral of sin(x) with respect to x is -cos(x), but we have to account for the fact that we're integrating with respect to u, not x.\\n\\nSo the integral becomes:\\n\\n= -\u222b du\\n\\n= -u + C\\n\\nNow we substitute back u = cosh(x):\\n\\n= -cosh(x) + C\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this at x = 4:\\n\\n= -cosh(4) + C\\n\\nSince we are only interested in the integer part of the result after rounding down, we don't need to calculate the constant C, and we don't need the decimal part of the result. We can directly round down the result of -cosh(4) to the nearest integer.\\n\\nUsing a calculator, cosh(4) \u2248 27.308236, so -cosh(4) \u2248 -27.308236.
