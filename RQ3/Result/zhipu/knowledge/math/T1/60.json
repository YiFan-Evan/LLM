We can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x) * 2/(e^x - e^(-x)) dx = \u222b 2sin(x)/u * du/u\\n\\nHowever, this substitution does not simplify the integral because sin(x) is not a function of u.

We need to find a substitution that will allow us to integrate the function. One way to do this is to recognize that the derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x), and the integral of sin(x) is -cos(x) + C. However, directly integrating sin(x)/sinh(x) is not straightforward, and the result involves special functions.\\n\\nThe integral of sin(x)/sinh(x) does not have a simple elementary function form, and it involves the hyperbolic cosine integral, also known as Chi (\u03c7) function, which is a special function. The integral is:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x)/sinh(x) dx = \u03c7(x) + C\\n\\nWhere \u03c7(x) is the hyperbolic cosine integral function.\\n\\nSince we cannot express the integral in terms of elementary functions, we cannot directly substitute x = 4 into the integral and round down to get an integer result. This integral would typically be evaluated using numerical methods or software capable of handling special functions.\\n\\nHowever, for the purpose of this exercise, let's assume we have a numerical approximation for the integral, and we'll proceed with the calculation as if we had an approximate expression for the integral. Let's denote the integral as I(x):\\n\\nI(x) \u2248 \u03c7(x)\\n\\nNow, we substitute x = 4 into I(x):\\n\\nI(4) \u2248 \u03c7(4)\\n\\nUsing a calculator or software that can handle the \u03c7 function, we can find an approximate value for \u03c7(4). Since we are looking for an integer result by rounding down, we would take the floor of this value.
