However, sinh(x) * cos(x) can be rewritten using a trigonometric identity. Since sinh(x) = (e^x - e^(-x)) / 2 and cos(x) = (e^(ix) + e^(-ix)) / 2, we can combine these to find a common exponential form.\\n\\nsinh(x) * cos(x) = [(e^x - e^(-x)) / 2] * [(e^(ix) + e^(-ix)) / 2]\\n\\nBut we don't actually need to use this form to integrate the function. Instead, we can use the fact that the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), and the derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x). This suggests that we might be able to integrate by parts, with u = sinh(x) and dv = cos(x)dx.\\n\\nLet's integrate:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x)dx\\n\\nUsing integration by parts, let u = sinh(x) and dv = cos(x)dx.

To solve it, we can add the integral to both sides and then divide by 2:\\n\\n2\u222bsinh(x)cos(x)dx = sinh(x)sin(x) + cosh(x)cos(x)\\n\u222bsinh(x)cos(x)dx = (sinh(x)sin(x) + cosh(x)cos(x)) / 2\\n\\nNow we can substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n(1/2)[sinh(4)sin(4) + cosh(4)cos(4)]\\n\\nTo find the integer result by rounding down, we would calculate this expression and then round down to the nearest integer.
