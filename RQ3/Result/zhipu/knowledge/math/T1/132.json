The integral of cos(sinh(x)) with respect to x is not straightforward and does not result in \u221a(1 + sinh^2(x)) as previously stated. Instead, we need to use the fact that the derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x), and we'll integrate cos(sinh(x)) with respect to sinh(x) instead of x.\\n\\nLet u = sinh(x), then du = cosh(x)dx. To express dx in terms of du, we use dx = du/cosh(x). However, since cosh(x) is not a simple function of u, we need to use another substitution. Let's consider the integral:\\n\\n\u222b cos(sinh(x)) dx\\n\\nNow, let v = sinh(x), so dv = cosh(x)dx. We want to express dx in terms of dv, which is simple: dx = dv/cosh(x). But since cosh(x) is not a simple function of v, we can't directly integrate cos(v) with respect to v/cosh(x). Instead, we use the identity cos^2(v) + sin^2(v) = 1, which in terms of hyperbolic functions becomes cosh^2(v) - sinh^2(v) = 1. Rearranging, we get cosh^2(v) = 1 + sinh^2(v), so cosh(v) = \u221a(1 + sinh^2(v)).\\n\\nNow, the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b cos(v) dv\\n\\nThis is a standard integral, and the result is:\\n\\nsin(v) + C\\n\\nSubstitute back v = sinh(x):\\n\\nsin(sinh(x)) + C\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this at x = 4:\\n\\nsin(sinh(4)) + C\\n\\nThe constant C will cancel out when we subtract the value at x = 0 from the value at x = 4 because the integral from 0 to 4 of cos(sinh(x))dx is the difference between the antiderivative evaluated at x = 4 and at x = 0.\\n\\nSo we have:\\n\\nsin(sinh(4)) - sin(sinh(0)) + C\\nsin(sinh(4)) - sin(0) + C\\nsin(sinh(4)) + C - 0\\n\\nSince we're interested in the integer part and we're rounding down, we don't need to worry about the constant C because it will not affect the integer part.
