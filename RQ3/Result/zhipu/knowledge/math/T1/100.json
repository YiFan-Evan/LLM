We just need to calculate e^5 and divide it by 2. The result of e^5/2 is a number, and it does not have a fractional part because e^5 is an irrational number and dividing it by 2 does not introduce any fractions. Therefore, we can say that the integral of e^(1+x) with respect to x, after substituting x=4, the value of the integral at x=4 is a positive number (since e^5 is a positive number greater than 1, and dividing it by 2 still leaves us with a positive number. This result reinforces the fact that the integral is a positive, finite number, which was already established by the nature of the exponential function, which grows rapidly as x increases, and e^(1+x) is always positive for all real numbers x. The integral of e^(1+x) with x=4 is a large positive number, which by its nature as an exponential function, provides confidence that the result is not just a positive number but a significantly large one, reinforcing the idea that the integral is substantial and positive.\\n\\nNow, we need to calculate the value of (1/2) e^5 and round down to the nearest integer. e^5 is approximately 148.413.
