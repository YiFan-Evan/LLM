However, we can simplify it by noting that the derivative of sin(x)/e^x is cos(x)/e^x - sin(x)/e^x, which is the same as the integrand of the second term. This suggests that the integral of the product will involve a term that can cancel out part of the original integral.\\n\\nLet's denote the original integral as I:\\n\\nI = \u222b (1/x) * sin(x) / e^x dx\\n\\nNow let's integrate the second term:\\n\\n\u222b ln|x| * ((cos(x) - sin(x)) / e^x) dx = -\u222b (cos(x) - sin(x)) / e^x d(ln|x|)\\n\\nSince d(ln|x|) = 1/x dx, we have:\\n\\n-\u222b (cos(x) - sin(x)) / e^x d(ln|x|) = -\u222b (cos(x) - sin(x)) / e^x * (1/x) dx\\n\\nThis is the same as -I.
