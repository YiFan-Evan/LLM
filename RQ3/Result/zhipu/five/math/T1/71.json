Let's denote u = x^2, so du/dx = 2x, which implies dx = du/(2x). But since we're integrating with respect to u, we can write the integral as:\\n\\n\u222b sinh(x^2) dx = \u222b sinh(u) (du/(2\u221au))\\n\\nNow, we know that the integral of sinh(u) is -cosh(u) + C. However, because of the 1/(2\u221au) factor, we need to adjust our result accordingly:\\n\\n\u222b sinh(u) (du/(2\u221au)) = -1/2 \u222b sinh(u) (du/\u221au)\\n\\nUnfortunately, there's no elementary function for the integral of sinh(u)/\u221au, so we would typically leave the integral in this form. However, since we are given the specific value to substitute (x = 4), we can directly evaluate the integral at u = 4^2 = 16.\\n\\n\u222b sinh(u) (du/(2\u221au)) from 0 to 16 = -1/2 [\u222b sinh(u) du/\u221au] from 0 to 16\\n\\nWe know that sinh(u) is an odd function, and the integral of an odd function over a symmetric interval around zero is zero. But in our case, we're not integrating over a symmetric interval, so we can't directly apply that property. Instead, we evaluate the definite integral:\\n\\n-1/2 [cosh(u)] from 0 to 16 = -1/2 [cosh(16) - cosh(0)]\\n\\nSince cosh(0) = 1, we have:\\n\\n-1/2 [cosh(16) - 1]\\n\\nNow we need to calculate cosh(16) and then substitute it into the expression above. Cosh(16) is approximately 8.7427, so:\\n\\n-1/2 [8.7427 - 1] = -1/2 [7.7427] \u2248 -3.87135\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get -4. However, since we are dealing with the definite integral from 0 to 16, we should consider the absolute value because the integrand is positive over the interval (0, 16). So we take the absolute value of the result:\\n\\n3.87135\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the integer result of the expression, after rounding down, is 3.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "sinh(x^2)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of sinh(x^2), we need to use a substitution that takes into account the x^2 in the function.
