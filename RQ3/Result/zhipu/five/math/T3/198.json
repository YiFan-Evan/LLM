This is a complex integral that typically does not have a simple closed-form solution involving elementary functions. However, we can attempt to approximate it numerically for a specific value of x.\\n\\nSince we're asked to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral, and since we cannot find a simple closed-form solution, we will need to resort to numerical methods to approximate the value of the integral at x = 4.
