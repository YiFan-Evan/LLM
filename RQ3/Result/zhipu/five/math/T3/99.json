Since we're looking for the integral of (1/x)/cos(x), we can use the fact that the integral of sec(x)tan(x) dx is sec(x) + C. We'll need to integrate by parts or use a substitution to find the integral of (1/x)/cos(x).\\n\\nHowever, this is a complex integral that typically requires special functions or numerical methods to solve, and it does not result in an elementary function.
