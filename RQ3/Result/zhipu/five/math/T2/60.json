Let u = cos(x), then du = -sin(x) dx, which means sin(x) dx = -du. The integral becomes:\\n\\n-\u222b 2 / (e^x - e^(-x)) du\\n\\nHowever, we need to express this in terms of x to integrate properly. Since u = cos(x), we have:\\n\\n-2\u222b 1 / (e^x - e^(-x)) d(cos(x))\\n\\nThis integral is not straightforward to evaluate directly. It involves a special function known as the dilogarithm function or Li_2. The integral of 1/sinh(x) is -Li_2(-e^(-x)), but we need to take into account the 2 outside the integral and the fact that we're integrating with respect to cos(x) not x directly.
