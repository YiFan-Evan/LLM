You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

From (9) Jompuses are vumpuses, wumpuses, and lempuses, we can deduce that since Rex is a jompus, he must also be a vumpus, a wumpus, or a lempus.\\n3. We don't have any direct information about Rex being a vumpus or a wumpus, but we can use (2) Everything that is a wumpus, a zumpus, or a yumpus is a sterpus. Since we don't know if Rex is any of these, we can't use this premise yet.\\n4. From (9) again, since Rex is a jompus, he could also be a lempus.\\n5. From (1) Lempuses are shumpuses, if Rex is a lempus, he is also a shumpus.\\n6. Now, we need to connect being a shumpus to being a grimpus. From (4) Everything that is a brimpus, a wumpus, or an impus is a dumpus, a grimpus, and a vumpus, we can see that if Rex is a shumpus (from being a lempus), and if shumpuses are included in the category of \\\"a brimpus, a wumpus, or an impus\\\" (which is not explicitly stated but we might infer based on the structure of the premises), then Rex would also be a grimpus.\\n\\nHowever, there is no direct premise that states shumpuses are included in \\\"a brimpus, a wumpus, or an impus,\\\" so this is not a valid derivation. We need to find a direct connection between jompus and grimpus.\\n\\n7. From (9) Jompuses are vumpuses, wumpuses, and lempuses, and (5) Everything that is a brimpus or a wumpus or an impus is a zumpus, we can deduce that since Rex is a jompus, he must be a zumpus as well.\\n8. From (4) again, since Rex is a zumpus, he could be a brimpus, a wumpus, or an impus.\\n9. Finally, from (4), if Rex is any of those (brimpus, wumpus, or impus), he is also a dumpus, a grimpus, and a vumpus.\\n\\nSo the minimal set of premises needed to prove that Rex is a grimpus is:\\n\\n(11) Rex is a jompus, (9) Jompuses are vumpuses, wumpuses, and lempuses, (5) Everything that is a brimpus or a wumpus or an impus is a zumpus, and (4) Everything that is a brimpus, a wumpus, or an impus is a dumpus, a grimpus, and a vumpus.\\n\\nTherefore, the answer is:\\n\\n(11),(9),(5),(4)->(12)\""}]
