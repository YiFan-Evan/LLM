BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node from the starting point. When a node is first visited, it is added to a queue, and its neighbors are visited next. To keep track of the paths, we often maintain a dictionary or a list that records the parent of each node, which allows us to reconstruct the path from the starting point to the target point once we reach it.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm applied to find the shortest path from a start node to a target node:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node and a dictionary to record the parent of each node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue the next node.\\n    b.

Initialize a queue and add the start node (2) to it. Also, create a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node.\\n2. Dequeue node 2 and mark it as visited. Node 2 has edges to nodes 3 and 7, so we enqueue these nodes and record that their parent is node 2.\\n3. Dequeue node 3 next. Node 3 has an edge to node 5, but node 5 is not the destination, so we continue. We enqueue node 5 with node 3 as its parent.\\n4. Dequeue node 7 next.
