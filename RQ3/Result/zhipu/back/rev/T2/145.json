BFS is well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nThe fundamental principles of BFS are as follows:\\n1. Start at the initial node (the starting point).\\n2. Create a queue and enqueue the starting node.\\n3. Keep a record of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n4. Dequeue a node and explore its neighbors.\\n5. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited and enqueue it along with the path taken to reach it.\\n6. Repeat the process until the target node is dequeued, or the queue is empty (which means the target is not reachable).\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 4:\\n\\n1. Start at node 8 and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue node 8 and explore its neighbors (13 and 9).\\n3. Enqueue node 13 and node 9 with the path 8->13 and 8->9, respectively.\\n4. Dequeue node 9.
