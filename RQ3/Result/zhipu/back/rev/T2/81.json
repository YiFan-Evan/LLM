BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path to each node is found in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nThe fundamental principles of BFS for finding the shortest path are:\\n\\n1. Start from the source node and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each adjacent node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, enqueue it, and record the parent of the node (to reconstruct the path later).\\n4. Repeat the process until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n5. Once the target node is found, backtrack from the target node to the source node using the recorded parents to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\nGiven graph: \\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\\nEdges: [[0, 6], [0, 11], [1, 11], [1, 3], [2, 4], [2, 12], [3, 10], [3, 12], [5, 9], [5, 8], [7, 8], [7, 11]]\\n\\nStart node: 2\\nDestination: 3\\n\\nWe will now perform BFS to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3.\\n\\n1.

Dequeue node 4, mark it as visited. Node 3 is not a neighbor of node 4, so we continue.\\n5. Dequeue node 12, mark it as visited. Node 3 is not a neighbor of node 12 either, so we continue.\\n6. Continue this process until we reach node 3 or exhaust all nodes.\\n\\nBy following the BFS algorithm, we find that the shortest path from node 2 to node 3 is not directly connected.
