The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting point, updating the shortest path estimate as it goes.\\n\\nHere are the basic steps of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark the starting node with a distance of 0 and all other nodes with a distance of infinity.\\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited.\\n5. Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 3.\\n6.

The next unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance is node 3, which has a distance of 1. Node 3's neighbors are node 5 and node 6. Node 5's distance is already smaller (1), but we update node 6's distance to 2.\\n3. The next unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance is node 5, which has a distance of 1. Node 5's neighbors are node 1, node 3, and node 4. Node 1 and node 3 already have smaller distances, but we update node 4's distance to 2.\\n4. The next unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance is node 1, which has a distance of 1. Node 1's neighbors are node 4 and node 7.

BFS is a traversal for a tree or graph data structure.
