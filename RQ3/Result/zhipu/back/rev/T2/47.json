The algorithm works by keeping a queue of nodes to explore, and for each node, it explores all its neighbors at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS would work for the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (0 in this case) and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (also known as the predecessor or parent of each node).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the queue and examine its neighbors.\\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet (or if a shorter path to it is found), record the node that led to this neighbor and enqueue the neighbor.\\n4. Repeat this process until the target node is dequeued from the queue, or the queue is empty (which means the target is not reachable).\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3:\\n\\n- Start with node 0, which leads to nodes 3 and 7.\\n- Node 3 is the target, so we stop here.\\n\\nThe path to node 3 is directly from node 0, so the shortest path is simply 0->3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->3\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 4], [3, 6], [4, 5], [4, 7]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node to the destination in this graph, we can again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
