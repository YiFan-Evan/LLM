BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be visited next, and it also maintains a set or a list to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set or a dictionary to track visited nodes and their parents (or the node that led to them).\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node from the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target node to the start node using the parent information.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each adjacent node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n4.

Then, we'll explore its neighbors, which are nodes that are directly connected to node 23.

Enqueue node 23 and mark it as visited.\\n2. Dequeue node 23 and explore its neighbors (9, 10, and 11).\\n3. Enqueue unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited, recording that their parent is node 23.\\n4. Continue with the next node in the queue (let's say it's node 9) and explore its neighbors, and so on.\\n5. When we reach node 19, we backtrack to reconstruct the path from node 19 to node 23.\\n\\nAfter performing these steps, let's say we find that the shortest path from node 23 to node 19 is through nodes 9, 3, and then 19.
