BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has done so using the shortest path. The algorithm works as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. Enqueue the starting node and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node.\\n   b. If it is the target node, the search is complete.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its unvisited neighbors, mark them as visited and enqueue them along with the current path to reach them.\\n4.
