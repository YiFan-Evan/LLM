BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges between the start node and the target node. Here's a brief explanation of the BFS algorithm applied to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. The queue will hold the nodes to be explored, and the visited set will keep track of the nodes that have already been visited to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n\\n2. Enqueue the start node and mark it as visited.\\n\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   - Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n   - If it is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n   - Otherwise, for each of its unvisited neighbors, mark them as visited and enqueue them along with the current node to indicate the path taken to reach them.\\n\\n4.
