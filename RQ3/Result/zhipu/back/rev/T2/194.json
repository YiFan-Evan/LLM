BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic makes BFS particularly suitable for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and check if it is the target node.\\n3. If it is the target node, we have found our shortest path.\\n4. If it is not, mark it as visited and enqueue all of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet.\\n5. Keep track of the previous node that led to each visited node so that we can reconstruct the path once we reach the target node.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 11 to node 17:\\n\\nGiven graph:\\n- Nodes: 0-24\\n- Edges: [[0, 18], [0, 11], [1, 23], [2, 11], [3, 5], [4, 15], [5, 14], [5, 20], [6, 7], [6, 8], [6, 23], [8, 10], [9, 22], [9, 13], [10, 12], [10, 15], [11, 24], [13, 16], [13, 24], [14, 21], [14, 17], [17, 23], [18, 20], [19, 23]]\\n\\nStart node: 11\\nDestination: 17\\n\\nWe perform BFS starting from node 11 and follow the algorithm's steps until we reach node 17.
