BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we first reach any node, we have found the shortest path to that node from the starting point. This is because BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node. This will help in reconstructing the path once we reach the target node.\\n4. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the target node, stop the search.\\n    c. Otherwise, mark the node as visited and for each of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited, add them to the queue and record their parent.\\n5. Once we reach the target node, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent pointers to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 9.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\n- Edges: [0-8], [0-12], [1-7], [2-3], [2-6], [2-14], [4-10], [4-6], [5-12], [6-11], [6-7], [7-12], [8-13], [9-13]\\n\\nStarting from node 3, we will follow the BFS procedure:\\n\\n1.

Dequeue node 2, mark it as visited, and process its neighbors: 3 (visited), 6 (visited), and 14.\\n5. Enqueue unvisited neighbors: node 14.\\n6.

Initialize a queue and add the starting node (node 9) to it.\\n2. Keep a set to track visited nodes to prevent reprocessing.\\n3.
