Since we are dealing with an unweighted graph, BFS is a suitable choice because it finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph efficiently.\\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works by exploring the graph level by level, beginning with the starting node. It keeps track of the nodes that have been visited and the distance from the start node to each visited node. It also keeps a record of the parent of each node, which allows us to reconstruct the path once we reach the target node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If it is the target node, reconstruct the path by following the parent pointers and return it.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each adjacent node that has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n3.
