BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found. The idea is to start at the root (or any arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph), and explore all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS would work for this problem:\\n\\n1.

Dequeue the next node and its path from the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, return the path.\\n   c.
