The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex until it reaches the target vertex. It maintains a set of unvisited nodes and calculates tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph with the start node as 9 and the destination as 10.\\n\\nStarting from node 9, we have the following tentative distances (initially set to infinity for all nodes except the start node, which is set to 0):\\n\\n- 9: 0\\n- All other nodes: \u221e\\n\\nWe then update the distances based on the edges:\\n\\n- From 9, we can reach 13 and 14 with distances 1 and 1, respectively.\\n\\nNow, we choose the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance (9, 13, or 14). Let's choose 9 (though 13 or 14 would yield the same result at this point since they have the same distance).\\n\\n- We don't update any distances since 9 is our starting node.\\n\\nNow we move to the next smallest tentative distance, which is 1 for nodes 13 and 14. Let's pick 13.\\n\\n- From 13, we can reach 5 and 9, but we do not update the distance to 9 because it's our start node and already has a distance of 0. We update the distance to 5 to be 2.\\n\\nNow we move to the next smallest tentative distance, which is 2 to node 5.\\n\\n- From 5, we can reach 8 and 13. We do not update the distance to 13 because it's already 1, which is smaller than 2 + the edge length. We update the distance to 8 to be 3.\\n\\nContinuing this process, we eventually update the distance to node 10, which is reachable from node 11 with a distance of 1. The distance to node 11 is currently 3 (from node 5), so the distance to node 10 becomes 3 + 1 = 4.\\n\\nWe keep doing this until we reach node 10, which will be our destination.

Initialize all distances to infinity except for the start node (node 10), which is set to 0.\\n2. Node 10 is directly connected to nodes 11 and 4.
