Since the graph provided doesn't specify weights for the edges, we'll assume each edge has a weight of 1 for simplicity.\\n\\nDijkstra's algorithm works by maintaining a set of unvisited nodes and calculating tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths. It selects the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, sets it as the new current node, and updates the distances of its adjacent nodes if a shorter path is found. This process continues until the destination node is reached or all nodes have been visited.\\n\\nHere's how we can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize the distances to all nodes to infinity, except for the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Initialize a priority queue (or a simple list in this case) with the start node and its distance.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue the node with the smallest distance.\\n    b. If this node is the destination, we have found the shortest path.\\n    c. Otherwise, for each of its neighbors, if the distance to the neighbor through the current node is shorter than the known distance to the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and enqueue it.\\n4. Once we have reached the destination, backtrack through the nodes to construct the path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the given graph with the start node as 8 and the destination as 9.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\\nEdges: [[0, 7], [0, 10], [0, 8], [1, 4], [2, 8], [2, 6], [2, 9], [3, 10], [4, 10], [5, 11], [5, 6], [9, 12]]\\n\\nStarting at node 8, we will explore its neighbors. Node 8 is connected to node 2, so we'll update node 2's distance to be 1 if it's greater than the current distance. Node 2 is already connected to node 9, so we'll follow that connection next.\\n\\nFollowing the path from node 8 to node 2 to node 9 gives us a path of length 2.
