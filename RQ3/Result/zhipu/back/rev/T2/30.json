BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point). It guarantees that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node. Here's a brief explanation of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node (or parent nodes).\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n3. Mark the node as visited.\\n4. For each of the node's neighbors, if it has not been visited, add it to the queue and record the current node as its parent.\\n5. Once the target node is dequeued, the shortest path can be reconstructed by backtracking from the target node to the starting node using the parent pointers.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4.\\n\\nGiven graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n- Edges: [[0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 6], [1, 7], [2, 5], [3, 4], [4, 6]]\\n\\nStarting node: 0\\nDestination node: 4\\n\\nUsing BFS, we would find the shortest path as follows:\\n\\n- Start at node 0, and explore its neighbors (node 2).\\n- From node 2, there are no direct neighbors that lead to node 4, so we go back to node 0 and explore its other neighbors.\\n- We reach node 1, which has neighbors 2, 6, and 7.
