BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, meaning it first explores all the neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic of BFS makes it suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it ensures that when we first reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set to keep track of nodes that have been visited.\\n2. Enqueue the starting node and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the target, we have found the shortest path.\\n    c. Otherwise, for each of the node's neighbors that have not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue them, keeping track of the node from which they were reached.\\n4. Once we reach the target node, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the recorded information to reconstruct the path.\\n\\nNow let's apply this to the given graph, starting from node 6 and aiming to reach node 10.\\n\\nApplying BFS to the graph:\\n\\n1.
