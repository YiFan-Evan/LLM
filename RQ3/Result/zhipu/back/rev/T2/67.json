BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the shortest path from the source node to all other nodes is found in an unweighted graph like the one provided.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, it's just the start node).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node and its path from the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, the path to this node is the shortest path, and we can return it.\\n   c.
