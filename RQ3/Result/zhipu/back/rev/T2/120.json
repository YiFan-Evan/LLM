The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex until all vertices are visited. It keeps a set of unvisited vertices and calculates tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given graph, starting at node 7 and aiming to reach node 12.\\n\\n- Start at node 7, set its distance to 0.\\n- The neighbors of 7 are 3 and 6. Update their tentative distances to 7 + edge_weight (which is 1 for both edges), so they become 8.\\n- Now, pick the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, which is either 3 or 6 (both have a distance of 8).\\n- Let's pick 3. It has no unvisited neighbors that would provide a shorter path, so we move on.\\n- Now we pick 6. Its unvisited neighbors are 5 and 13. The distance to 5 would be 6 + 1 = 7, which is shorter than its current distance, so we update it. The distance to 13 would be 6 + 1 = 7, which is shorter than its current distance of 13, so we update it.\\n- We continue this process, always expanding the node with the smallest tentative distance, until we reach the target node, which is 12.\\n\\nTo provide the exact steps and the shortest path, we would need to implement the algorithm. However, I can provide the shortest path directly by simulating the algorithm conceptually:\\n\\nStarting at 7, the shortest path to 12 is 7->6->5->9->12.

Alternatively, we could simply reverse the graph's edges and run the algorithm from node 12 to node 7 in the original graph direction.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how we would apply Dijkstra's algorithm in the original graph from node 12 to node 7:\\n\\n1. Initialize node 12 as the starting node with a distance of 0 and all other nodes with a distance of infinity.\\n2. Node 12 has neighbors 5 and 9 with direct edges. Update their distances to 1 (the weight of the edge).\\n3. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest distance, which would be either 5 or 9 (both with a distance of 1). Let's pick 5.\\n4. Node 5 has neighbors 6 and 12 (it's a loop to itself, which we can ignore). Update the distance to 6 to 2 since 5 + 1 is shorter than its current distance.\\n5. Now choose node 9, which has a direct edge to node 12. Update the distance to node 12 to 2 (since 9 + 1 is shorter than its current distance).\\n6.
