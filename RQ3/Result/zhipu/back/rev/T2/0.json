BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found. It starts at a selected node and explores all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path that led to it (initially, just the starting node).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the queue and examine it.\\n3. If this node is the target, you have found the shortest path.\\n4. If not, enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors, adding the current node to the path that led to each neighbor.\\n5.

The neighbors of node 2 are node 7. From node 7, we find that its neighbors are nodes 0 and 2 (node 2 is the starting node, so we ignore it as we have already visited it). We continue this process until we reach node 1.\\n\\nHere is how the BFS traversal would proceed:\\n\\n- Enqueue (2, [2]) - Starting at node 2 with path [2]\\n- Dequeue (2, [2]), enqueue (7, [2, 7]) - Move to node 7, path is [2, 7]\\n- Dequeue (7, [2, 7]), enqueue (0, [2, 7, 0]) - Move to node 0, path is [2, 7, 0]\\n- Dequeue (0, [2, 7, 0]), enqueue (5, [2, 7, 0, 5]) - Move to node 5, path is [2, 7, 0, 5]\\n- Dequeue (5, [2, 7, 0, 5]), enqueue (6, [2, 7, 0, 5, 6]) - Move to node 6, path is [2, 7, 0, 5, 6]\\n- Dequeue (6, [2, 7, 0, 5, 6]), no unvisited neighbors - Node 6 does not lead to node 1\\n- Go back to the queue and continue with node (0, [2, 7, 0])\\n- Dequeue (0, [2, 7, 0]), already visited node 5, check if there are other unvisited neighbors\\n- Dequeue (5, [2, 7, 0, 5]), already visited node 6, check if there are other unvisited neighbors\\n- Dequeue (5, [2, 7, 0, 5]), enqueue (1, [2, 7, 0, 5, 1]) - Move to node 1, path is [2, 7, 0, 5, 1]\\n\\nWe've reached the destination node 1 with the path [2, 7, 0, 5, 1].
