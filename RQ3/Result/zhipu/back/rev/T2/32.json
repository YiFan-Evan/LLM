It is particularly good for graphs with non-negative edge weights, but since we are not given weights, we can assume each edge has a weight of 1 for simplicity.\\n\\nThe algorithm works by repeatedly picking the vertex with the smallest distance from the start point that has not been visited yet, and calculating the distance through it to each of its neighbors. If any of these distances are shorter than the previously known distances, the shortest distance is updated, and the vertex is marked as visited once all its neighbors have been processed.\\n\\nHere are the steps of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nNow let's apply this to the given graph. We start at node 3 and our goal is to reach node 0.\\n\\n1. Initialize distances: {0: \u221e, 1: \u221e, 2: \u221e, 3: 0, 4: \u221e, 5: \u221e, 6: \u221e, 7: \u221e}\\n2. Current node is 3, neighbors are 2 with distance 1, and the distance to 1 is also 1.\\n3. Update distances: {0: \u221e, 1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 0, 4: \u221e, 5: \u221e, 6: \u221e, 7: \u221e}\\n4. Move to the node with the smallest distance which is now node 1, its neighbors are 3, 4, and 5 with distances 1, 1, and 1 respectively.\\n5. Update distances: {0: \u221e, 1: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: \u221e, 7: \u221e}\\n6. Move to node 2, its neighbors are 3 and 5 with distances 1 and 1.\\n7. Update distances: {0: \u221e, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: \u221e, 7: \u221e}\\n8. Move to node 4, its neighbors are 0 and 5 with distances 1 and 1.\\n9. Update distances: {0: 2, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 1, 6: \u221e, 7: \u221e}\\n10. Move to node 5, its neighbors are 0, 6, and 7 with distances 1, 1, and 1.\\n11. Update distances: {0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 1, 4: 0, 5: 0, 6: 1, 7: 1}\\n12. Move to node 6 or 7 (both have the same distance at this point).\\n13. Update distances for node 6 or 7 (if they have neighbors that could be reached with a shorter path).\\n14. Node 0 has been updated with a distance of 1, and since it is our target, we stop here.\\n\\nNow we backtrack from the target node (0) to the start node (3) to find the shortest path. Since the distance to 0 is 1, we know that we came from node 5, and so on until we reach node 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->2->0 or 3->5->0 (both are shortest paths since we have not specified which path to take when multiple paths of the same length exist).
