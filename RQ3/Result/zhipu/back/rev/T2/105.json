However, since the provided graph does not specify the weights of the edges, we can assume that each edge has the same weight (which is typical for an unweighted graph). In this case, Dijkstra's algorithm can be simplified to a version that is often referred to as the Uniform Cost Search, which is essentially a breadth-first search (BFS) when all edge costs are equal.\\n\\nThe principle behind BFS is that it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we first reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node from the starting point. This is because all edges have the same cost, so the shortest path to a node is the path with the fewest edges.\\n\\nHere's how we can find the shortest path using BFS:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n4. If this node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n5. Otherwise, add all unvisited adjacent nodes to the queue and mark them as visited.\\n6.
