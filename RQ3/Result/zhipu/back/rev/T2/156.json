BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node from the starting node. This is because in an unweighted graph, the shortest path to a node is the path with the fewest edges.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for our purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node and examine its neighbors.\\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet (not in the dictionary), mark it as visited by adding it to the dictionary with the current node as its predecessor.\\n4. Enqueue the neighbor.\\n5. Once we reach the target node, we can backtrack from the target node to the start node using the dictionary to find the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with start node 7 and destination node 8:\\n\\n1. Initialize the queue with node 7 and an empty dictionary.\\n2. Dequeue node 7 and enqueue its neighbors: 11 and 9.\\n3. Dequeue node 11 (which has no path to node 8), and enqueue its neighbors if they haven't been visited.\\n4. Dequeue node 9 and enqueue its neighbors: 10 (which has no path to node 8) and 7 (which is already visited).\\n5.

Since the graph is unweighted, BFS will ensure we find the shortest path by traversing the graph level by level.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS would find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node 8 and a dictionary or a parent map to keep track of the nodes that can reach the current node.\\n2. Dequeue the node 8 from the queue and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 2, 5, 12, and 13.\\n3. Dequeue the next node (let's say 2) and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 0, 1, and 8 (which is already visited, so we skip it), and so on for the other neighbors of 8.\\n4. Continue this process, always choosing the shortest path available (which BFS guarantees by exploring all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level).\\n5. When we reach node 7, we stop and backtrack using the parent map to construct the shortest path from node 7 to node 8.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the graph:\\n\\n- Start with node 8, enqueue its neighbors: 2, 5, 12, and 13.\\n- Dequeue node 2, enqueue its neighbors: 0, 1, and 5 (which is already visited).\\n- Dequeue node 5, enqueue its unvisited neighbors.\\n- Continue until node 7 is reached.\\n\\nTo find the exact path, we would need to keep track of the parent of each node as we visit them. However, for the purpose of this explanation, I will summarize the steps until we reach node 7:\\n\\n- From node 8, we can reach node 2.\\n- From node 2, we can reach node 5.\\n- From node 5, we can reach node 4.\\n- From node 4, we can reach node 6.\\n- From node 6, we can reach node 10, and from node 10, we can reach node 9.\\n- From node 9, we can reach node 7.\\n\\nSo the shortest path from node 8 to node 7 is: 8->2->5->4->6->10->9->7.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->2->5->4->6->10->9->7.\""}]
