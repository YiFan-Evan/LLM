BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (in this case, the starting node), and keeps track of the nodes that have been visited to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n\\nThe steps for BFS to find the shortest path are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node.\\n2. Dequeue a node from the queue and check if it is the target node.
