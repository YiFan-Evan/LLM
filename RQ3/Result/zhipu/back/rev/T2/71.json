BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path.\\n\\nThe steps for BFS are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n3. If the node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n4. If it's not the target, mark it as visited and add all of its unvisited neighbors to the queue.\\n5.

Since we only have the final node (6) and we are not given the actual connections in the form of an adjacency list, we have to infer the path by looking at the edges and the visited nodes.
