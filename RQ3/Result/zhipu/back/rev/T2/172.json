BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path from the start node to the target.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind BFS is to start at the root (the starting node in this case) and explore all its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored and a set or a dictionary to keep track of the visited nodes and their parents to reconstruct the path.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS would be used to find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to track the path.\\n2. Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node. If it is, reconstruct the path using the dictionary.\\n3. If the node is not the target, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and record the path by setting the current node as the parent of each neighbor.\\n4.
