BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path since all edges can be considered to have equal weight (e.g., a distance of 1).\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we stop and backtrack to find the path.\\n   c. Otherwise, mark it as visited.\\n   d. For each neighbor of this node that has not been visited, add it to the queue and record the node from which it was reached (this helps in reconstructing the path later).\\n4. Once the target node is reached, backtrack using the recorded information to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 10.\\n\\nGiven the graph and the starting and destination nodes, the BFS process would proceed as follows:\\n\\n- Start at node 4, which has neighbors 6 and 9.\\n- Visit node 6 first (since the order of visiting neighbors doesn't matter for unweighted graphs), which has neighbors 0, 4, 12, and 14.\\n- From node 6, we've already visited node 4, so we skip it. We then visit node 12, which has no unvisited neighbors.\\n- Go back to node 6 and visit node 14, which has no unvisited neighbors either.\\n- Now, visit node 9 from node 4, which has neighbors 11 and 13.\\n- Continue exploring until we reach node 10, which is a neighbor of node 8, and node 8 is a neighbor of node 0, which in turn is a neighbor of node 4.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 4 to node 10 is 4->6->0->8->10.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->6->0->8->10.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 8], [0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 10], [4, 9], [4, 6], [5, 14], [6, 12], [6, 14], [7, 8], [8, 10], [9, 11], [9, 13]]} The start node: 10 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from node 10 to node 4 in the given graph, we can again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
