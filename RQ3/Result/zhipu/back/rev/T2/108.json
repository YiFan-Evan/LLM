BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we first reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node from the starting point.

Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set or dictionary to track visited nodes and their predecessors.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the queue.\\n    b. If it is the target node, stop the search.\\n    c. Otherwise, for each of its neighbors that haven't been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue them.

The neighbors of 9 are 0 and 6, so we enqueue them. Since 3 is not among the neighbors of 9, we continue. We then dequeue node 0 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors, which are 9 and 6 (9 is already visited, so we don't enqueue it again). Next, we dequeue node 6 and find that it has no unvisited neighbors that would lead us to node 3. We proceed to node 1, which has a neighbor 12, but that doesn't lead to 3 either. We continue this process until we reach node 2, which has neighbors 5, 10, and 3. Node 3 is a neighbor of node 2, so we have found our shortest path.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 9 to node 3 is through node 6 to node 2 and then to node 3.
