The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored, and it maintains a dictionary or a list to keep track of the shortest path to each node it has visited.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how we would use BFS to find the shortest path from the starting node (0) to the target node (2):\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node, with the starting node having a path of [0].\\n\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n\\n3. For each neighbor of this node, if the neighbor has not been visited (i.e., it's not in the path dictionary), add it to the queue and update the path dictionary with the shortest path to this neighbor (which is the current path plus the neighbor).\\n\\n4. Once we reach the target node, we can stop, as we have found the shortest path.\\n\\n5.
