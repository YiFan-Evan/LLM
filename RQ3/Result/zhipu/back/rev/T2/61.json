The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to explore, and a set or a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and the shortest path to each visited node.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS in the context of finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Create a dictionary to track the paths to each node, starting with the starting node having an empty path.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node to visit.\\n   b. If this node has not been visited, mark it as visited.\\n   c. For each of the node's neighbors that haven't been visited, enqueue the neighbor and record the path to reach it by appending the current node to the path of the current node.\\n4.
