BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of the BFS algorithm applied to a graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node and add it to the visited set.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, we stop and backtrack to find the path.\\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of this node.\\n4. To reconstruct the shortest path, we'll also maintain a parent dictionary that keeps track of which node each visited node was discovered from.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 3:\\n\\n- Start by enqueueing node 6.\\n- Dequeue node 6, mark it as visited, and check its neighbors: there are no direct edges from 6 to any node that can take us closer to node 3.\\n- Move to the next unvisited neighbor of node 6, which is node 7.

Node 3 is not directly connected, but nodes 0 and 4 are steps closer to node 3.\\n- We continue this process until we enqueue node 3, which is our target.\\n\\nAfter finding node 3, we backtrack using the parent dictionary to construct the path from node 3 to node 6, which will be the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's simulate this process.
