BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found. It works by starting at the root node, exploring all its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the first element (node and path).\\n3. If the current node is the destination, the path is the shortest path.\\n4. If not, for each of the current node's neighbors, if the neighbor has not been visited yet, enqueue it with the updated path (current path + neighbor).\\n5. Repeat the process until the queue is empty or the destination is found.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph with the start node as 11 and the destination as 13.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\\n- Edges: [[0, 3], [0, 11], [1, 9], [2, 6], [3, 12], [3, 10], [4, 13], [4, 10], [5, 6], [6, 13], [7, 11], [7, 9], [8, 11], [9, 14]]\\n\\nStarting at node 11, we follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Enqueue node 11 with path [11].\\n2. Dequeue node 11, check its neighbors (0, 7, 8), and enqueue them with updated paths.\\n3. Node 0 is visited, so we don't enqueue it again. Nodes 7 and 8 are enqueued with paths [11, 7] and [11, 8], respectively.\\n4. Dequeue node 7 and check its neighbors (11, 9), enqueue node 9 with path [11, 7, 9].\\n5. Dequeue node 8 and check its neighbors (11), no new nodes to enqueue since we've visited them already.\\n6. Dequeue node 9 and check its neighbors (14), enqueue node 14 with path [11, 7, 9, 14].\\n7. Dequeue node 14 and find that there are no more neighbors to enqueue.\\n8. At this point, we have not reached node 13, so we continue with the next node in the queue, which is node 0.\\n9. We continue this process until we reach node 13.\\n\\nBy applying BFS, we find that the shortest path from node 11 to node 13 is through node 6, as node 6 is directly connected to node 13. Node 6 can be reached from node 11 through node 5 and then node 6 (since node 5 is connected to node 6).
