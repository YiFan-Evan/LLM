BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from a given source node, and keeps track of the shortest path found to each node it visits. It uses a queue to keep track of the next nodes to explore and a dictionary (or a similar data structure) to record the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS can be applied to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node and a dictionary with the start node as the key and `None` as the value (indicating that there's no previous node in the path to the start node).\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node to explore.\\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited (not in the dictionary), mark it as visited by adding it to the dictionary with the current node as its previous node, and enqueue it.\\n4.
