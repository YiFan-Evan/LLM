Since we are looking for the shortest path in an unweighted graph, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.\\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. Add the starting node to the queue and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node and consider it the current node.\\n   b. If the current node is the target node, the path is found.\\n   c. For each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it with the current node as its predecessor.\\n4.
