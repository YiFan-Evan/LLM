BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges from the source node to all other nodes. Since all edges are unweighted (we can assume they have the same weight of 1), BFS will also give us the shortest path in terms of the actual distance.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for our purpose:\\n\\n1.
