BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed. It works by keeping a queue of nodes to explore and marking nodes as visited once they're taken from the queue.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (node 1 in this case).\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3.
