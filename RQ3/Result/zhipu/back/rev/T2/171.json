BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it. If it's the target node, you've found the shortest path.\\n3. If it's not the target node, enqueue all of its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet, along with the path to reach them (the current path plus the adjacent node).\\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph, starting from node 10 and looking for the shortest path to node 9.\\n\\nWe'll start by enqueueing node 10 with the path [10]. Then we'll proceed as follows:\\n\\n1. Dequeue node 10 with path [10], check its neighbors: there are no direct edges to node 10 in the given edges, so we look at the neighbors of its neighbors.\\n2. From node 10, we can reach node 9 through node 12 (since 10 is connected to 12 through node 9).\\n3. We enqueue node 12 with the path [10, 12].\\n4. Dequeue node 12 with path [10, 12], and we find node 9 as a direct neighbor.\\n5.
