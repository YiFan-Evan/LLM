The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is done so via the shortest path from the starting node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1.

Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c.
