BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores all nodes at the present \\\"depth\\\" before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic ensures that the first time it encounters the target node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. The queue will hold the nodes that need to be explored, and the visited set will keep track of nodes that have already been visited to avoid cycles.\\n2. Enqueue the starting node and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n   b. If this node is the target, the search is complete.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its unvisited neighbors, mark it as visited and enqueue it along with the path to reach it.\\n4. Once the target node is dequeued, the path to reach it is the shortest path.\\n\\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 5.\\n\\nStarting at node 2, we explore its neighbors, which are nodes 3 and 5.
