The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex. It keeps a set of unvisited vertices and calculates tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the provided graph to find the shortest path from node 10 to node 1.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\n- Edges: [[0, 9], [0, 11], [1, 8], [1, 12], [2, 7], [3, 4], [4, 5], [4, 7], [6, 11], [6, 8], [7, 11], [8, 10]]\\n\\nStarting at node 10 and looking for the shortest path to node 1:\\n\\n1. Node 10 has a direct edge to node 8, so we'll update the distance to node 8 to be 1 + 0 (since the edge length isn't given, we'll assume it's 1).\\n2. From node 8, we can reach node 1 directly with an edge, so we'll update the distance to node 1 to be 1 + 1 = 2.\\n\\nSince we have reached the destination node (node 1) with a distance of 2, we have found the shortest path.
