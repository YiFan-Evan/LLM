The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and examine it.\\n3. If this node is the target node, the path leading to it is the shortest path.\\n4. If not, enqueue all of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet, along with the path leading to them.\\n5.
