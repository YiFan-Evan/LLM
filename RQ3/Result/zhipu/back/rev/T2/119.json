BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node from the starting node by exploring all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Keep a dictionary or a list to store the parent of each node. This will help backtrack the path from the destination node to the start node.\\n4. Dequeue a node from the queue and enqueue all its adjacent nodes that have not been visited.\\n5. For each adjacent node that is enqueued, record the current node as its parent.\\n6. Continue until the destination is dequeued or the queue is empty.\\n7. Once the destination is reached, backtrack from the destination node to the start node using the parent pointers to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 3:\\n\\nGiven graph: \\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\\nEdges: [[0, 8], [1, 6], [1, 9], [1, 11], [2, 8], [3, 4], [4, 5], [4, 8], [5, 11], [7, 11], [8, 10], [8, 12]]\\n\\nStarting node: 5\\nDestination: 3\\n\\nUsing BFS, we would find the shortest path as follows:\\n\\n- Enqueue the start node (5).\\n- Dequeue 5 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (4 and 11).\\n- Dequeue 4 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (3 and 8).
