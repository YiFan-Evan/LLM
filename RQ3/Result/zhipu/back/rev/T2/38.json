BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbors of a node at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to be explored and is well-suited for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path to reach it (initially, the path is just the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node. If it is, the path to this node is the shortest path.\\n3. If the node is not the target, for each of its unvisited neighbors, enqueue the neighbor along with the path to reach it (the current path plus the neighbor).\\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph with the start node as 1 and the destination as 2:\\n\\n1. Enqueue the start node 1 with path [1].\\n2. Dequeue node 1, and explore its neighbors: 3 and 7. Enqueue these with paths [1->3] and [1->7].\\n3. Dequeue node 3, and explore its neighbors: 0, 1, and 4. Since 1 is already visited, we skip it. Enqueue node 0 and 4 with paths [1->3->0] and [1->3->4].\\n4. Dequeue node 7. Its only unvisited neighbor is 1, but since it's already visited, we skip it.\\n5. Dequeue node 0. Its unvisited neighbors are 3 and 5. Enqueue these with paths [1->3->0->3] and [1->3->0->5], but we skip node 3 because it's visited.\\n6. Dequeue node 4. Its unvisited neighbor is 5. Enqueue it with path [1->3->4->5].\\n7. Dequeue node 5. Its unvisited neighbor is 6. Enqueue it with path [1->3->4->5->6].\\n8. Dequeue node 6. It has no unvisited neighbors.\\n9. Dequeue node 5 from the earlier step. Its neighbor 2 is unvisited, so we enqueue it with path [1->3->4->5->2].\\n\\nAt this point, we've found the target node 2 with the path [1->3->4->5->2].
