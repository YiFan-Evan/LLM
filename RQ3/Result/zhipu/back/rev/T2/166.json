BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the shortest path to each node is found before moving on to nodes that are further away. It maintains a queue to keep track of the next nodes to explore, and a set or a dictionary to keep track of the visited nodes and their shortest distance from the starting node. Here's how the BFS algorithm works in this context:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and insert the starting node into it.\\n2. Keep a set to track visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n   b.
