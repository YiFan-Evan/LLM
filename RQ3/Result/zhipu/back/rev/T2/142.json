Dijkstra's algorithm is usually used when the graph has weighted edges, but since we're not given any weights and we're looking for the shortest path in terms of the number of edges, BFS is more appropriate for this scenario.\\n\\nBFS works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored and maintains a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node that has been visited.\\n\\nHere's how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary with the starting node having a path of [start_node].\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore all its neighbors.\\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet, add it to the queue and update the path dictionary to reflect the shortest path to that neighbor.\\n4. If the target node is dequeued, the shortest path to the target has been found.\\n\\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 13.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\n- Edges: [[0, 3], [0, 12], [0, 4], [1, 9], [2, 8], [2, 4], [2, 14], [5, 10], [5, 13], [6, 7], [7, 9], [7, 14], [9, 11], [12, 13]]\\n\\nStarting at node 3, we follow the BFS process:\\n\\n- Node 3 is visited and added to the queue with a path [3].\\n- Node 3's neighbors are 0 and 12. Node 0 is not on the path to 13, so we skip it. Node 12 is added to the queue with a path [3, 12].\\n- Node 12's neighbors are 0 and 13.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path to that node (which is just the node itself at this point).\\n2. Dequeue the first node from the queue and examine its neighbors.\\n3. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it with the updated path that includes the current node.\\n4.
