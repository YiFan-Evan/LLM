BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges from the source to the target node.\\n\\nThe steps for BFS are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set or dictionary to record visited nodes and their parents (or the path to reach them).\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the target, reconstruct the path from the start node to the target by following the parent pointers.\\n    c.
