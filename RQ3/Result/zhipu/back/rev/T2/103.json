The algorithm works by repeatedly picking the vertex with the minimal distance from the start point that has not been included in the shortest path tree yet. It then updates the distances to the neighboring vertices.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 1.\\n\\n1. Initialize the distances to all nodes as infinity, except for the start node (node 8), which is set to 0.\\n2. Node 8 is the starting node, so we examine its neighbors: there are no direct edges from node 8 in the given graph, so we move to the next step.\\n3. The next unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance is node 6 (connected to node 8 with an edge). The distance to node 6 through node 8 is 1 (the edge itself).\\n4. Now we look at the neighbors of node 6: nodes 11 and 8. The distance to node 11 through node 6 is 1 (current distance to node 6) + 1 (edge to node 11) = 2, which is less than the current distance to node 11. The distance to node 8 is the same as the current distance to node 8, so we don't update it.\\n5. We continue with the next unvisited node with the smallest distance. This is node 11, with a distance of 2. We look at its neighbors: nodes 1, 6, and 7. The distance to node 1 through node 11 is 2 + 1 = 3, which is the shortest path found so far to node 1.\\n6. Since node 1 is our target and we've found the shortest path to it (3), we can stop the algorithm here.\\n\\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 8 to node 1 is: 8->6->11->1.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 4], [1, 4], [1, 11], [2, 10], [3, 7], [3, 12], [5, 7], [6, 8], [6, 11], [7, 11], [10, 12]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from node 1 to node 8 in the given graph, we can once again use Dijkstra's algorithm.
