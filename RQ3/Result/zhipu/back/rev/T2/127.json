It works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from a starting vertex, and it effectively maintains a priority queue of all vertices that have not been visited yet, where the priority is the distance from the starting vertex.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph, starting at node 10 and aiming to reach node 6.\\n\\nStarting at node 10:\\n- Current distance to 10 is 0.\\n- Neighbors of 10 are 11 and 14. Update their distances.\\n\\nContinuing this process, we'll eventually find the shortest path to node 6. Since I can't execute code, I will describe the process conceptually:\\n\\n1. From 10, we have two options: 11 and 14. Let's choose 14 because it will lead to more nodes that might have a shorter path to node 6.\\n2. We visit node 14 and find that it connects to node 3.\\n3. We visit node 3 and find that it connects to node 0 and node 13.\\n4. We visit node 0 and find that it connects to node 13 and node 3 (which we've already visited), and also to node 2.\\n5. We visit node 2 and find that it connects to node 8.\\n6. We visit node 8 and find that it connects to node 10 (which is the starting point and we already have the shortest path to it) and node 4.\\n7. We visit node 4 and find that it connects to node 8 (which we've already visited) and node 12.\\n8. From node 12, there are no direct connections to node 6, but we can reach node 6 through node 5.\\n\\nSo the shortest path from node 10 to node 6 would be: 10->14->3->0->2->8->4->12->5->6.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->14->3->0->2->8->4->12->5->6\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 13], [0, 3], [1, 9], [1, 6], [2, 8], [3, 14], [4, 12], [4, 8], [5, 6], [5, 13], [7, 9], [8, 10], [10, 11], [10, 14]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve this problem, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.

Update the distances of its neighbors (nodes 6 and 13) to 2.\\n- Next, node 9 has a distance of 2 and is the smallest among the unvisited nodes. It is connected to node 1, which is already visited, so no update is needed.\\n- Node 3 has a distance of infinity, but it is connected to node 0, which has a distance of infinity. Since node 3 is connected to node 0 via node 6, we update the distance to node 3 to 3.\\n- Node 4 has a distance of infinity, but it is connected to node 12, which has a distance of infinity. Since node 4 is connected to node 12 via node 6, we update the distance to node 4 to 3.\\n- We continue this process until we reach node 10 or visit all nodes.
