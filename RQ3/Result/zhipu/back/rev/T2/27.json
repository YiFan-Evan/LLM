The algorithm works by keeping a queue of nodes to explore, and for each node, it explores all of its neighbors at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of the steps involved in BFS for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, mark the node as visited.\\n   d.
