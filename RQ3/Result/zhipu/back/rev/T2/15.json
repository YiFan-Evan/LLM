BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nThe basic steps of the BFS algorithm are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set to keep track of nodes to visit and nodes that have already been visited.\\n2. Add the starting node to the queue and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. Check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found the shortest path.\\n    c.
