The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to visit and maintains a dictionary or a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the steps involved in using BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Initialize a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node, setting the path to the starting node as just the start node itself.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node to visit.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, if the neighbor has not been visited:\\n      i. Mark the neighbor as visited.\\n      ii. Record the path to the neighbor by appending it to the path of the current node.\\n      iii. Enqueue the neighbor.\\n4.
