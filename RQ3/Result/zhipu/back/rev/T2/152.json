In this case, we'll assume the edges have a weight of 1 since it's not specified otherwise. The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex, until it reaches the target vertex.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark the starting node with a distance of 0 and all other nodes with a distance of infinity.\\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set.\\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited, then stop; the shortest path is completed.\\n6. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 3.\\n\\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 11.\\n- The neighbors of node 11 are node 12, with a distance of 1.\\n- Move to node 12.\\n- The neighbors of node 12 are nodes 2, 4, and 11.

The distance to 10 is 2.\\n- Move to node 10.\\n- The neighbors of node 10 are nodes 7 and 13. The distance to node 3 through node 10 is 4.\\n- However, we notice that we can reach node 3 directly from node 4 with a distance of 3, which is shorter than the distance from node 10.\\n- Since we have not visited node 4 yet, we move to node 4.\\n- Node 4 has a direct edge to node 3, with a distance of 1.\\n- We reach the destination node 3 with a total distance of 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 11->12->2->4->3\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 14], [1, 6], [1, 13], [1, 12], [2, 12], [3, 4], [4, 12], [5, 11], [7, 8], [7, 10], [8, 9], [10, 13], [11, 12]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 11"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node (3) to the destination node (11) in the given graph, we will use Dijkstra's algorithm.
