BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nThe fundamental principles of BFS are as follows:\\n\\n1. Start from the initial node (the starting point).\\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n3. Keep track of all visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n4. For each node visited, record the node from which it was reached (the predecessor).\\n5. When the target node is reached, backtrack using the recorded predecessors to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n- Edges: [[0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 7], [2, 4], [3, 6], [3, 5], [5, 7]]\\n- Start node: 1\\n- Destination: 5\\n\\nWe'll initiate BFS from node 1.
