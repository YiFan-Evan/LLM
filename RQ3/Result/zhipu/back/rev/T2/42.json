BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. This characteristic makes BFS particularly useful for finding the shortest path on an unweighted graph because it guarantees that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node.\\n2. Dequeue a node and check if it is the target node. If it is, reconstruct the path from the start node to the target node using the shortest path dictionary.\\n3.

Node 1 is connected to node 4 and node 2, so we reach node 2 via node 1.\\n- Once we reach node 2, we can stop and reconstruct the path.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 4 to node 2 is 4 -> 1 -> 2.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->1->2\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 5], [3, 7], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve this problem, we will again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, as it is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
