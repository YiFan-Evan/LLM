BFS is particularly useful for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph like the one provided.\\n\\nThe fundamental principle of BFS is to use a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored. Starting from the initial node, BFS adds all of its adjacent nodes to the queue and continues this process until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS can be applied to the given problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the starting node).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it. If it's the target node, the path to this node is the shortest path.\\n3. If it's not the target node, enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors along with the updated path.\\n4.
