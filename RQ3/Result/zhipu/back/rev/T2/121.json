BFS is a traversing algorithm for graphs that explores all the vertices of a graph at their respective levels. It starts at a selected node and explores all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This property makes BFS suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Keep a parent map or a predecessor map to record the node that led to the current node.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and process it:\\n   a. If it is the target node, we stop and backtrack using the parent map to find the shortest path.\\n   b.

We process node 0 next, and enqueue its neighbors (1, 11, 10) and mark 0 as visited. Node 10 is the next to be processed and we find its neighbors (2, 12), but since node 2 is already visited, we only enqueue node 12 and mark 10 as visited. We continue this process until we reach node 4. \\n\\nBacktracking from node 4 to the start node 2 using the parent map gives us the shortest path. \\n\\nSince I cannot execute code, I will provide a hypothetical result based on the described algorithm.
