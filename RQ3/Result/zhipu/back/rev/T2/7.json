BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed.\\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works by starting at the source node and exploring all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored and a set (or dictionary) to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to track the paths (or previous nodes).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target, reconstruct the path by backtracking through the path dictionary.\\n4. If the node is not the target, enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors and record the node from which they were reached in the path dictionary.\\n5. Mark the node as visited.\\n6.

We realize that we missed checking node 1 from node 3 in our previous steps. Node 1 has not been visited yet, so we enqueue it.\\n8. Dequeue node 1. Node 1 has edges to nodes 3 and 4.
