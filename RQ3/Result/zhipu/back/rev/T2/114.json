BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point). It ensures that when we first visit a node, we have found the shortest path to that node. This is because BFS checks all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set to track visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\\n   d.
