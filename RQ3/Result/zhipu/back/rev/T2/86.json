BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed from the source to the target node.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set or a dictionary to track visited nodes and their parents (or the path taken to reach them).\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and examine it:\\n   - If it's the target node, we've found the shortest path.\\n   - Otherwise, add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue and record their parent.\\n4. Once we reach the target node, we can backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent references to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 7 to node 11:\\n\\n- Start at node 7, and add it to the queue.\\n- Node 7 is connected to node 0 and node 5. Both are unvisited, so we enqueue them and mark them as visited with 7 as their parent.\\n- Next, we dequeue node 0. It's connected to nodes 5 and 7, but both have already been visited, so we don't enqueue them again.\\n- We dequeue node 5. It's connected to nodes 0, 3, and 8. Node 0 is already visited, but node 3 and node 8 are not, so we enqueue them with 5 as their parent.\\n- We dequeue node 3. It's connected to node 5, which is already visited, so we don't enqueue any more nodes from here.\\n- We dequeue node 8. It's connected to nodes 1, 5, 6, and 11. Nodes 1, 5, and 6 are already visited, but node 11 is the target and is unvisited, so we enqueue it with 8 as its parent.\\n- We dequeue node 11, which is the target.
