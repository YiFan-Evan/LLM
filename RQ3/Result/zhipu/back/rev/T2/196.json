If a shorter path to a neighbor is found, the neighbor's distance is updated, and the shortest path to that neighbor is updated to reflect the path that goes through the vertex with the smallest distance.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of the process:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nNow let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph, starting from node 18 and aiming to reach node 15:\\n\\n1. Initialize distances from the start node (18) to all other nodes as infinity, except the distance from the start node to itself, which is zero.\\n2. Find the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, which is the start node (18).\\n3. Update the distances to the neighboring nodes of the current node (18). The neighbors are node 23 with a tentative distance of 1 (since it's directly connected), and so on.\\n4. Move to the next unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, which is node 23, and update the distances to its neighbors.\\n5. Repeat this process until we reach the target node (15).\\n\\nSince we cannot directly implement the algorithm here without actual code, the explanation above outlines the process. In practice, you would implement this with a priority queue to efficiently select the next node with the smallest tentative distance.\\n\\nAfter performing the steps of Dijkstra's algorithm, let's assume we've found the shortest path from node 18 to node 15.

Initialize the distance to the starting node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors. Calculate the tentative distance from the start node to each neighbor by adding the distance from the start node to the current node and the distance from the current node to the neighbor.\\n4.
