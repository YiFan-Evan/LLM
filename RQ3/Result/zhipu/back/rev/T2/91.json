BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point), and keeps track of the shortest path to each node it visits. It does this by maintaining a queue of nodes to explore and a dictionary (or list) to store the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works in this context:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the visited nodes and their shortest path from the start node.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node from the queue.\\n   b. If the node is the target, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c.
