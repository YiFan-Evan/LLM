The algorithm works by repeatedly picking the vertex with the minimal distance from the start point that has not been included in the path yet, and calculating the distance through it to each of its neighbors.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the provided graph with the start node 4 and the destination node 6.\\n\\nStarting at node 4, we have the following distances:\\n- 4 to 4: 0 (starting point)\\n- 4 to 3: infinity (no direct edge)\\n- 4 to 0: infinity (no direct edge)\\n- 4 to 1: infinity (no direct edge)\\n- 4 to 7: infinity (no direct edge)\\n- 4 to 5: infinity (no direct edge)\\n- 4 to 6: infinity (no direct edge)\\n\\nNode 4 is connected to nodes 0 and 3. We update their tentative distances:\\n- 4 to 3: 1 (direct edge)\\n- 4 to 0: 1 (direct edge)\\n\\nNow we move to the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, which is either node 0 or node 3 (both have a distance of 1). Let's pick node 0:\\n- 0 to 3: infinity (no direct edge)\\n- 0 to 1: 2 (direct edge)\\n- 0 to 7: 3 (direct edge)\\n\\nUpdate the tentative distances:\\n- 3: 2 (via 0)\\n- 1: 2 (via 0)\\n- 7: 3 (via 0)\\n\\nNext, we move to the smallest tentative distance, which is node 3:\\n- 3 to 1: 1 (direct edge)\\n\\nUpdate the tentative distance:\\n- 1: 1 (via 3)\\n\\nNow we move to node 1:\\n- 1 to 7: 1 (direct edge)\\n\\nUpdate the tentative distance:\\n- 7: 2 (via 1)\\n\\nNext, we move to node 5, which is now the closest unvisited node with a tentative distance of 2 (via node 4):\\n- 5 to 6: 1 (direct edge)\\n\\nUpdate the tentative distance:\\n- 6: 3 (via 5)\\n\\nNode 6 is the destination, and we've found the shortest path to it, which is through nodes 4, 5, and then 6. Now we can backtrack from the destination to construct the path.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->5->6\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 4], [5, 6]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node 6 to the destination node 4 in the given graph, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm.

Initialize all nodes with a tentative distance of infinity, except for the start node (node 6), which is set to 0.\\n2.
