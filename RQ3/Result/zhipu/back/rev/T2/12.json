Both algorithms are capable of finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, but Dijkstra's algorithm is more efficient if edge weights are present and non-negative. Since the graph provided doesn't specify any weights for the edges, we can assume it's unweighted and use BFS for simplicity and efficiency in this case.\\n\\nBFS works by exploring the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point). It keeps track of all the visited nodes and the shortest path to each visited node. When it reaches the target node, we have our shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of how BFS would work for this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and insert the starting node into it, along with the path to reach it (which starts with just the starting node).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the first element.\\n   b. If it's the target node, we've found our shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet, enqueue them with the updated path.\\n3.
