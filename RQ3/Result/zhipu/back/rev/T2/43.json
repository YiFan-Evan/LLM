However, since you have not specified that we should use Dijkstra's algorithm or any other specific algorithm, I'll use a simple Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, which is well-suited for unweighted graphs like the one provided. BFS will find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nHere are the steps involved in using BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path to reach it (initially just the start node itself).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the first element (this will be the current node and the path to reach it).\\n   b. If the current node is the target node, we have found our shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it along with the path to reach it (the current path plus the neighbor).\\n3.
