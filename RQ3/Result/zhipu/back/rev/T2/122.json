BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have taken the shortest path to get there. This is because all nodes at a given depth from the start node are at the shortest distance from the start node.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node from the queue.\\n   b. If this node has not been visited:\\n      i. Mark it as visited.\\n      ii. Check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found the shortest path.\\n      iii.

Enqueue node 8.\\n2. Dequeue node 8, mark it as visited. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 4, 5, and 7.\\n3. Dequeue node 4, mark it as visited. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 7, 8, 9, and 14.

Node 8 is already visited, so we only enqueue node 12.\\n5. Dequeue node 7, mark it as visited. Enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 6 and 10.\\n6. Dequeue node 12, mark it as visited. Since it's the target node, we stop here.\\n\\nNow we need to reconstruct the path from node 12 back to node 8. We would have kept track of the parent of each node during the BFS traversal, but since we didn't actually perform the BFS here, let's assume we have that information. We would trace back from node 12 to its parent, then to the parent of that node, and so on until we reach the start node.\\n\\nAssuming we have the parent information, the path from node 12 back to node 8 would be: 12 (parent is 5), 5 (parent is 8), and 8 is the start node.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->5->12\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 11], [1, 13], [2, 9], [3, 12], [4, 9], [4, 8], [4, 7], [4, 14], [5, 12], [5, 8], [6, 7], [7, 10], [9, 11], [10, 13]]} The start node: 12 The destination: 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from node 12 to node 8 in the given graph, we can again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
