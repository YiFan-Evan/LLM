BFS is a traversal for a tree or graph data structure. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores all nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nThe key principle of BFS that makes it suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph is that it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This means that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere are the steps of the BFS algorithm applied to our problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   - If this node is the target, we have found the shortest path.\\n   - Otherwise, for each adjacent node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\\n   - Keep track of the parent of each node so that we can reconstruct the path once we reach the target.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 13:\\n\\n1.
