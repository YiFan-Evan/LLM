The algorithm works by repeatedly picking the vertex with the minimal distance from the start point that has not been included in the path yet, and calculating the distance through it to each of its neighbors.\\n\\nHere are the steps involved in Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for the initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n2. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n4. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n6. The shortest path from the start node to the target node is the path with the smallest tentative distance.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the given graph.\\n\\nStarting at node 6, the tentative distances to all other nodes are set to infinity, except for node 6 itself, which is set to 0.\\n\\nWe will keep track of the current shortest paths to each node as we progress.\\n\\nAt each step, we'll choose the node with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been visited yet. Let's begin:\\n\\n1. Node 6 is the start node, with a distance of 0.\\n2. Neighbors of 6: 4 and 2. The distance to 4 is infinity, and the distance to 2 is infinity. Update the distances: both 4 and 2 have a new tentative distance of 1 (since the edge length from 6 to 4 and 6 to 2 is implicitly 1).\\n3. The smallest distance in the unvisited set is now for nodes 2 and 4, both with a distance of 1. We pick one (let's say 2) to visit next.\\n4. Node 2 has neighbors 1 and 6. The distance to 1 is currently infinity, so update it to 2 (since the edge length from 2 to 1 is implicitly 1). The distance to 6 is already 0, so we don't change it.\\n5. The next smallest distance is for node 4 with a distance of 1. We visit node 4 next.\\n6. Node 4 has a neighbor 6, but we don't update the distance because the distance to 6 is already 0, which is smaller than the current tentative distance of 2 for node 6 from node 4.\\n7. Now we have to decide between node 1 (distance 2) and node 7 and 11 (both with distance infinity). We visit node 1 next.\\n8. Node 1 has neighbors 2 and 3. The distance to 2 is 1, which is smaller than the current tentative distance of 2 for node 2 from node 1, so we don't update it. The distance to 3 is currently infinity, so update it to 3 (since the edge length from 1 to 3 is implicitly 2).\\n9. We continue this process until we reach the target node 2.
