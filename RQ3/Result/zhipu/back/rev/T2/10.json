This characteristic of BFS makes it suitable for finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of the steps involved in BFS for this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, it's just the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n3. If this node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n4. If not, for each of its adjacent nodes, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it with the updated path.\\n5.
