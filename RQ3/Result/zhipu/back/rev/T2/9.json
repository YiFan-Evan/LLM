The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the next node to explore, and it maintains a dictionary or a list to record the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a dictionary to track the shortest path to each node, with the starting node's path being just the node itself.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c.
