BFS is well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n1. Start from the given starting node.\\n2. Explore all the neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n3. Keep track of all visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n4. Also, keep track of the parent of each node so that you can backtrack the path once the target node is reached.\\n5. When the target node is reached, backtrack from the target node to the starting node using the parent pointers to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 7:\\n\\n1. Start at node 8.\\n2. Explore its neighbors: nodes 2, 7, and 13.\\n3.
