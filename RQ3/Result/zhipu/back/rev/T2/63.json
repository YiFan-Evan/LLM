Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each of its adjacent nodes, if the node has not been visited yet, enqueue it with the path extended by this node.\\n4. Repeat until the target node is dequeued or the queue is empty.\\n5.
