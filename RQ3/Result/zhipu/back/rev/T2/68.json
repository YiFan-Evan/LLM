However, since the graph is unweighted and we are looking for the shortest path in terms of the number of edges, we can also use a simple method of backtracking from the destination to the start if we have the parent pointers from a BFS that starts at the destination.\\n\\nLet's assume we perform BFS starting from node 3 and keep track of the parent of each node we visit. We will stop when we reach node 0. Here's how we can do that:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node (3 in this case) and a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node.\\n2.

For each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent as the current node, and enqueue it.\\n4.

However, in this case, we only have one node in the queue and it does not lead to node 0, so we would have to backtrack from node 3 to node 1, and from node 1 to node 0.\\n\\nNow we backtrack from node 0 to node 3 to find the shortest path:\\n\\n- The parent of node 5 is node 3\\n- The parent of node 3 is node 1 (from the BFS process)\\n- The parent of node 1 is node 0 (from the BFS process)\\n\\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 0 is: 3->5->1->0\\n\\nSo the final answer is: 3->5->1->0\""}]
