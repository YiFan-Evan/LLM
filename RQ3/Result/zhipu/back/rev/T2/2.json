BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path from the start node to the target.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the first element of the queue. If this node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n3. If it's not the target, iterate over its adjacent nodes and for each one, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it along with the path to reach it by appending the current node to the path.\\n4.

From node 6, we can reach node 0. From node 0, we can reach nodes 1, 6, and 7. Since we are looking for the shortest path to node 1, we find it directly reachable from node 0.

Since node 0 is the only adjacent node to node 1 in the given edges, we enqueue node 0 with the updated path (1->0).\\n5. Next, we dequeue node 0 and look at its adjacent nodes. Node 0 is connected to nodes 1, 6, and 7. Node 1 is already visited, so we consider nodes 6 and 7.\\n6. We enqueue nodes 6 and 7 with the updated path (1->0->6) and (1->0->7).\\n7.
