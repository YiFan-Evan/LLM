BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node as soon as we reach it.\\n\\nThe fundamental principle of BFS is to use a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes that need to be explored. Starting from the initial node, BFS will explore all of its neighbors at the current level before moving on to nodes at the next level. We also maintain a set or a dictionary to keep track of the nodes visited and the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS would be applied to find the shortest path from the start node (6) to the destination node (5):\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with its path (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the first node from the queue and check if it is the destination node. If it is, we have found our shortest path.\\n3. If it is not the destination node, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors along with the updated path leading to them.\\n4. Mark the current node as visited.\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the destination node is found or the queue is empty.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph with the start node (6) and the destination node (5):\\n\\n- Start with node 6. Enqueue (6, [6]) and mark 6 as visited.\\n- Dequeue (6, [6]), explore its neighbors 12 and 7. Enqueue (12, [6, 12]) and (7, [6, 7]), mark 12 and 7 as visited.\\n- Dequeue (12, [6, 12]). Since 12 is not the destination, explore its neighbors. We find that 5 is a neighbor of 12, so we enqueue (5, [6, 12, 5]) and mark 5 as visited.\\n- Dequeue (5, [6, 12, 5]).
