BFS is particularly suitable for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node from the starting point.\\n\\nThe steps of the BFS algorithm are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, stop the search.\\n   c.
