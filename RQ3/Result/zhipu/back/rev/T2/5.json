The algorithm works by keeping track of the minimum distance from the start vertex to each vertex in the graph. It initializes the distance to the start vertex as 0 and all other distances as infinity. Then, it repeatedly selects the vertex with the smallest distance, updates the distances to its adjacent vertices, and continues this process until all vertices are visited or the target is reached.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how Dijkstra's algorithm works for the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize distances from the start node (0) to all other nodes as infinity, except for the start node itself, which is 0.\\n2. Set the start node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited, we have found the shortest path.\\n6. If the destination node has not been visited, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 3.\\n\\nNow, let's apply the algorithm to the provided graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 0, which has edges to nodes 1 and 3.\\n- Visit node 3 first because it has a direct edge from the start node, and update the distance to node 3 to 1 (since it's the only edge connected to the start node with no previous distance).\\n- From node 3, we can reach node 5 and node 7 with distances 2 and 1 respectively, but since we haven't visited node 5 and 7 yet, we update their distances.\\n- Node 1 is also reachable from node 0 with a distance of 1, so we update its distance if it's smaller than the current one (which it isn't in this case).\\n- Next, we visit node 7 because it's the closest unvisited node and it has a distance of 1 from node 3.\\n- From node 7, we can reach node 6 with a distance of 1. Since node 6 is our destination, we have found the shortest path.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 0 to node 6 is 0->3->7->6.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->3->7->6\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [3, 7], [4, 6], [6, 7]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve this problem, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm, but this time we'll start from the destination node and find the shortest path back to the starting node.

Node 5 is not on the path to node 0, so we ignore it.\\n- From node 2, we can reach node 3, but we don't need to update its distance since it's already smaller than the current one.\\n- Finally, from node 3, we can reach node 0 with a distance of 1.
