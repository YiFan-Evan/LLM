It works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting point. The algorithm keeps a set of unvisited nodes and calculates tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths.\\n\\nHere are the steps of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph and find the shortest path from node 5 to node 7.\\n\\n1. We start at node 5 and set its distance to 0 (since it's the starting node).\\n2. We consider the neighbors of node 5, which are node 11, and calculate the tentative distances.\\n3. We move to the neighbor with the smallest tentative distance, which in this case is node 11.\\n4. We update the distances of the neighbors of node 11. Node 7 is a neighbor of node 11, and the distance from node 5 to node 7 through node 11 is 1 (the direct distance from 5 to 11 is 1, and from 11 to 7 is 0 because they are directly connected).\\n5. Since node 7 is a neighbor of node 11 and we have found a path to it with a distance of 1, we have found the shortest path from node 5 to node 7 because there are no other nodes to visit that could potentially provide a shorter path.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->11->7\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 7], [0, 12], [1, 9], [2, 3], [3, 6], [4, 12], [5, 11], [6, 9], [7, 8], [7, 11], [9, 10]]} The start node: 7 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve this problem, we can once again use Dijkstra's algorithm.
