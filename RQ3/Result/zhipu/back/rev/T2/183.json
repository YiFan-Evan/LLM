BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we visit all of the node's neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic of BFS makes it the ideal algorithm for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, because it guarantees that the first time we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's how the BFS algorithm works:\\n\\n1.
