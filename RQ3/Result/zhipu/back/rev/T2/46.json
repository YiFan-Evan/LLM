BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges between the start node and the target node. Here's a high-level overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n4.
