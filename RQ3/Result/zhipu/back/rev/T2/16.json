It is a greedy algorithm that guarantees to find the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.\\n\\nHowever, in the case of an unweighted graph (which it seems we have, as no weights are provided for the edges), a simpler algorithm can be used: Breadth-First Search (BFS). BFS is particularly suitable for unweighted graphs because it explores nodes in layers, ensuring that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere is how BFS works for our problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path to reach it (initially, just the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of this node, if the neighbor hasn't been visited yet, enqueue it along with the path to reach it by appending the neighbor to the current path.\\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or the target node is reached.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph, starting from node 5 and aiming to reach node 4:\\n\\n1. Enqueue (5, [5]) - Start with node 5.\\n2. Dequeue (5, [5]), examine node 5. Its neighbors are 0 and 4.\\n3. Node 0 is not the target, so enqueue it with path [5, 0].\\n   Node 4 is the target, so we have found our shortest path: [5, 4].\\n4.
