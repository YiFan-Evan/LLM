BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, meaning it first explores all the neighbors of the starting node, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on, until the target node is reached. This property of BFS makes it suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node.\\n4. If it is the target node, the search is complete.\\n5. If it is not the target node, add all unvisited neighbors of the current node to the queue and mark them as visited.\\n6. Keep track of the previous node for each visited node so that you can reconstruct the path once the target node is reached.\\n7. Once the target node is reached, backtrack using the recorded previous nodes to reconstruct the path from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 10 to node 4.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\n- Edges: [0-6], [0-9], [0-7], [1-4], [2-11], [3-4], [3-5], [3-8], [3-11], [7-11], [10-11], [11-12]\\n\\nStarting from node 10, the BFS will proceed as follows:\\n\\n- Node 10 is visited, and its neighbors (11) are added to the queue.\\n- Node 11 is visited, and its neighbors (2, 3, 10, 12) are added to the queue (10 is already visited so it is not added again).\\n- Node 2 is visited, and its neighbor (11) is already visited, so it is not added to the queue.\\n- Node 3 is visited, and its neighbors (4, 5, 8, 11) are added to the queue.\\n- Node 4 is found, which is the target node.\\n\\nThe path can be reconstructed by following the previous nodes leading to the target node.
