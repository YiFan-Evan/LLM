The most efficient algorithm to solve this problem is Dijkstra's algorithm. However, since the graph is unweighted, we can also use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is simpler and just as effective for this purpose. BFS explores the graph level by level and ensures that when we first reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works by maintaining a queue and a set of visited nodes. Starting from the source node, it adds all of its adjacent nodes to the queue. It then continues to the next level of nodes by dequeuing a node, marking it as visited, and enqueueing all its unvisited adjacent nodes. This process repeats until the target node is reached or the queue is empty.\\n\\nNow let's apply BFS to the provided graph to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 5.\\n\\nGiven graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n- Edges: [[0, 5], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 5], [2, 7], [4, 7], [5, 6]]\\n\\nStarting node: 3\\nDestination node: 5\\n\\nPerforming BFS:\\n\\n1.
