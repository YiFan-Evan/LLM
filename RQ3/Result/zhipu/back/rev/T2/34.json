BFS is particularly useful for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind BFS is to start from the root node (the starting point) and explore all its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This is typically implemented using a queue. For each node, we keep track of the path that led to it, which allows us to reconstruct the shortest path once we reach the target node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm applied to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path to that node (initially just the node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. If it is the target node, the path to this node is the shortest path.\\n4. If it is not the target node, enqueue all of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet, along with the path that led to them.\\n5.
