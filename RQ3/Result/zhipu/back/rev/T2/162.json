BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it visits a node for the first time, it has found the shortest path to that node. This is because BFS always explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target, the path leading to it is the shortest path.\\n4.

However, since I can't execute code, I'll describe the steps that would be taken:\\n\\n1. Node 23 is enqueued with the path [23].\\n2. Node 23 is visited and its unvisited neighbors are enqueued with the path [23, neighbor].\\n3. Node 20 is a neighbor of node 23 and would be visited next. Its unvisited neighbors would be enqueued with the path [23, 20, neighbor].\\n4. Node 21 is a neighbor of node 20 and would be visited next. Since node 22 is a neighbor of node 21, the path to node 22 would be found, and it would be returned.\\n\\nWithout executing the code, I can infer that the shortest path from node 23 to node 22 would be through node 20 and then node 21.
