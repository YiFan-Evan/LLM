The BFS algorithm explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path because all nodes at the current level have the shortest distance from the start node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node and check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found the shortest path.\\n   b. If it is not the target, explore all of its adjacent nodes. For each adjacent node:\\n      - If it has not been visited yet, mark it as visited by adding it to the queue and recording its parent.\\n3. Once we have found the target node, backtrack from the target to the start using the parent pointers to reconstruct the path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the given graph, starting from node 3 and aiming to reach node 9.\\n\\nStarting from node 3, we will explore its neighbors (0, 9, and 12). Node 9 is one of the neighbors of node 3, so we have found our shortest path right away.
