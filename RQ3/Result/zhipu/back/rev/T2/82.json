The fundamental principle behind BFS is that it explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (in this case, the starting point), and keeps track of the shortest path to each node it visits. It uses a queue to manage the nodes that need to be explored and a dictionary (or an array) to store the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary with the starting node having a path to itself (e.g., `path[6] = [6]`).\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, if the neighbor has not been visited (i.e., not in the path dictionary), add it to the queue and update the path to reach this neighbor by appending it to the current node's path.\\n4. If the target node is dequeued, the shortest path has been found.\\n5. Continue this process until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 6 and the destination node 4.\\n\\nStarting with node 6, we will explore its neighbors (4 and 7), then their neighbors, and so on, until we reach node 4. Here is how the BFS process would look for this specific case:\\n\\n- Start with node 6 in the queue and path[6] = [6].\\n- Visit node 4 and update the path to [6, 4].
