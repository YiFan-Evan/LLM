BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nThe steps for BFS are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. Add the start node to the queue.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\\n   a. Dequeue the first node from the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, we have found our shortest path.\\n   c.
