Node 11 has one edge to node 12. Move to node 12, which has an edge to node 2, and so we enqueue node 2.\\n3. Node 2 has an edge to node 12 (which we've already visited), so we ignore it.

At node 4, we see an edge to node 12 (visited) and node 3 (our target). Since we've found the target, we reconstruct the path using the parent pointers.\\n\\nBacktracking from node 3, we find that its parent is node 4. Node 4's parent is node 12, and node 12's parent is node 11.
