BFS is particularly suitable for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored.\\n2. Start from the given start node, mark it as visited, and enqueue it.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore all its adjacent nodes.\\n4. For each adjacent node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record the node from which it was reached, and enqueue it.\\n5. If the target node is dequeued, the shortest path has been found, and we can backtrack from the target node to the start node using the recorded information.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 10 to node 3:\\n\\n1. Start from node 10, mark it as visited, and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue node 10 and explore its adjacent nodes. Node 12 is adjacent and not visited, so mark it as visited, record that we reached it from node 10, and enqueue it.\\n3. Dequeue node 12 and explore its adjacent nodes. Node 10 is already visited, so we skip it. Node 11 is adjacent and not visited, so mark it as visited, record that we reached it from node 12, and enqueue it.\\n4. Continue this process until we dequeue node 3, which means we have reached the target. Now we backtrack from node 3 to node 10 using the recorded information.\\n5. We find that node 3 was reached from node 11, node 11 from node 12, and node 12 from node 10.\\n\\nConstructing the path from node 10 to node 3, we get: 10->12->11->3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->12->11->3.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 8], [2, 8], [2, 6], [3, 11], [4, 8], [6, 9], [6, 10], [7, 8], [10, 12], [11, 12]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"As previously explained, we will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to the end node in an unweighted graph.
