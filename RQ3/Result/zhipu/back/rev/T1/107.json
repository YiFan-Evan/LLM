The algorithm works by repeatedly picking the vertex with the smallest distance from the start point that has not been visited yet, and calculating the distance through it to each of its adjacent nodes.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. The distance to the target node is the shortest distance from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nNow let's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 9 to node 0:\\n\\n1. We start at node 9 with a distance of 0 and all other nodes have a distance of infinity.\\n2. Node 9 has neighbors 10 and 11 with distances of infinity. The distance to node 10 through node 9 is 1, and to node 11 is 1. We update these distances.\\n3. Now we look at the neighbors of node 10, which are nodes 4, 8, and 9. We don't update node 9 since its distance is already 0, and we don't update node 4 or 8 since their distances through node 10 are greater than their current distances.\\n4. Next, we move to node 11, which has neighbors 1 and 9. We don't update node 9 since its distance is already 0, and we update node 1 to have a distance of 2.\\n5. We go to node 1, which has neighbors 2, 9, and 11. We update node 2 to have a distance of 3.\\n6. We proceed to node 2 and find node 3 as its neighbor. We update node 3 to have a distance of 4.\\n7. Node 3 has no unvisited neighbors that can be reached with a shorter path, so we move to node 6, which has a distance of 1 through node 0.\\n8. Since node 6 is connected to node 0, we have found the shortest path to node 0 with a distance of 1 + 1 = 2.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 9 to node 0 is through nodes 10 and 6.
