BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbors of a node at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to be visited and maintains a set or a list to keep track of visited nodes. For finding the shortest path, we also keep track of the parent of each node so that we can reconstruct the path once we reach the target.\\n\\nHere's how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a dictionary to track the parent of each node.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node.\\n4. If it is the target node, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target node to the start node using the parent pointers.\\n5. If it is not the target node, add all unvisited children of the current node to the queue and mark them as visited by setting their parent.\\n6. Once the target node is found, the search can be terminated.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the given graph with the start node as 5 and the destination as 8.\\n\\n1. Start with node 5 in the queue. Mark it as visited.\\n2. Explore its neighbors (13 and 18) and add them to the queue.\\n3. Continue with the BFS process until we reach node 8.\\n4.
