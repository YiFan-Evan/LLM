It can also be applied to graphs with positive weights. The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex, until it reaches the target vertex.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\\n\\n1. Mark the starting node as visited and set its distance to 0.\\n2. Set the distance of all other nodes to infinity.\\n3. While there are unvisited nodes:\\n    a. Select the unvisited node with the smallest known distance.\\n    b. For each neighbor of this node:\\n        i. Calculate the distance through the current node.\\n        ii. If this distance is shorter than the previously known distance, update the shortest distance.\\n4.

Initialize distances to all nodes as infinity, except for the start node (20), which is set to 0.\\n2. Initialize a priority queue or a list to keep track of the nodes to visit, starting with the start node.\\n3. Begin the loop and select the node with the smallest distance (which is the start node at the beginning).\\n4.

In this case, it would look something like this (simplified for clarity, not including all nodes and edges):\\n\\n   ```\\n   {\\n       0: {22: 1},\\n       1: {14: 1, 4: 1, 2: 1},\\n       2: {11: 1},\\n       3: {13: 1},\\n       4: {13: 1, 21: 1, 22: 1},\\n       5: {11: 1},\\n       6: {10: 1},\\n       7: {16: 1, 14: 1},\\n       8: {16: 1},\\n       9: {10: 1, 17: 1},\\n       10: {6: 1, 9: 1},\\n       11: {23: 1, 24: 1, 2: 1, 5: 1},\\n       12: {19: 1, 21: 1},\\n       14: {15: 1},\\n       16: {17: 1},\\n       17: {},\\n       18: {23: 1},\\n       19: {},\\n       20: {21: 1},\\n       21: {20: 1, 12: 1, 4: 1},\\n       22: {0: 1, 4: 1},\\n       23: {11: 1, 18: 1},\\n       24: {11: 1}\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n   Note: The actual mapping would include all nodes and edges with their respective distances, which are not provided in the graph description.\\n\\n2.

Initialize a dictionary to store the shortest distance from the start node to each node. Set the distance to the start node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity.\\n\\n4. While the priority queue is not empty, dequeue the node with the smallest distance.\\n\\n5. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the distance through the current node.
