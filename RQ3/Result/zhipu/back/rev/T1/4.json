BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path because all the previous levels have been explored before moving on to the next level.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, maintain a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent, which will help us backtrack the path once we reach the target node.\\n4. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the target, stop the search.\\n    c. Otherwise, mark it as visited and for each of its unvisited neighbors, add them to the queue, and record their parent.\\n5.
