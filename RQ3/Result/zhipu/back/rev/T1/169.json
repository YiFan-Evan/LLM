Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (node 3). Also, maintain a dictionary to track the parent of each node, which will help reconstruct the path later.\\n2. Dequeue node 3 and mark it as visited. Since node 3 is connected to node 23, enqueue node 23 and record that its parent is node 3.\\n3. Dequeue node 23 and mark it as visited. Node 23 has node 14 as an unvisited neighbor, so enqueue node 14 with node 23 as its parent.\\n4. Dequeue node 14 and mark it as visited. Node 14 is directly connected to node 7, so enqueue node 7 with node 14 as its parent.\\n5. Dequeue node 7, and since it is the end node, we stop the BFS process. We now reconstruct the path from node 7 back to the start node by following the parent pointers.\\n\\nReconstructing the path from node 7 to node 3, we get: 7 -> 14 -> 23 -> 3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->23->14->7.\""}]
