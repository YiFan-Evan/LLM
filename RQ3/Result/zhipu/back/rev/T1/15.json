BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path because we have explored all nodes at the current level before moving on to nodes at the next level.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n1. Start from the given starting node.\\n2. Mark the starting node as visited and enqueue it (place it in a queue).\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. For each of its adjacent nodes:\\n      i. If the node has not been visited, mark it as visited.\\n      ii. Record the node's parent (to reconstruct the path later).\\n      iii. Enqueue the node.\\n4. Once the target node is dequeued, backtrack from the target node to the starting node using the parent references to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 2 and the destination node 5.\\n\\nStarting at node 2:\\n- Enqueue 2\\n- Visit 2 and mark it as visited\\n- Dequeue 2\\n- Visit and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 0, 4, and 6\\n- Dequeue 0 (visited), 4 (visited), and 6 (visited)\\n- Continue with the next level of nodes...\\n\\nWe'll continue with the BFS process until we enqueue or reach node 5.

Let's try to solve the problem again step by step using the BFS algorithm, as it is the most suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nHere's the BFS algorithm applied to the graph with start node 2 and end node 5:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (2).\\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\\n3. Also, keep track of the previous node for each visited node to reconstruct the path later.\\n\\nNow, let's walk through the BFS process:\\n\\n- Enqueue the start node 2.\\n- Dequeue 2, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (0, 4, 6).\\n- Dequeue 0, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (if any).\\n- Dequeue 4, mark it as visited. Node 4 has an unvisited neighbor 7, so we enqueue 7.\\n- Dequeue 6, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (if any).\\n- Dequeue 7, mark it as visited. Node 7 has no unvisited neighbors.\\n- At this point, we have not yet reached node 5, so we continue with the nodes enqueued from the neighbors of 2.\\n- We dequeue 0 (which has no path to 5) and then 6 (which also has no direct path to 5).\\n- We go back to the neighbors of node 2 and consider node 4, which we have already visited, but we need to check if it leads to node 5 through its unvisited neighbors.\\n- We see that node 4 has no direct connection to node 5.\\n\\nSince we have not found a path from 2 to 5 through the direct neighbors of 2, we need to backtrack. However, we notice that we have not explored the path from node 3 to node 5. We missed this in the first pass because we started from node 2 and did not explore node 1's neighbors.\\n\\nLet's correct this oversight:\\n\\n- We should have also considered node 1 when we started at node 2, but since we missed it, we need to go back to the beginning and consider node 1's neighbors.\\n- From node 1, we visit node 3 and enqueue it.\\n- Dequeue 3, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (5, 6).\\n- Dequeue 5, mark it as visited, and since it's our target, we stop the search.\\n\\nNow we backtrack to reconstruct the path:\\n\\n- Node 5 was visited from node 3.\\n- Node 3 was visited from node 1.\\n- Node 1 was not directly connected to any of the nodes we visited, so we go back to node 2, which was visited directly from node 0.\\n- Since we missed the connection from node 2 to node 4 in the first pass, we need to correct that and realize that node 4 was visited from node 2.\\n\\nThe correct shortest path from node 2 to node 5 is actually 2 -> 4 -> 7 -> 3 -> 5, but since node 7 is not on the direct path from 2 to 5, we must have made a mistake in our process. Let's correct it and find the actual shortest path:\\n\\n- Starting from node 2, we visit node 4 directly.\\n- From node 4, there is no direct path to node 5, so we must have missed the connection from node 3 to node 5 when we visited node 3 from node 1.\\n\\nThe correct shortest path from node 2 to node 5 is 2 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5 because:\\n\\n- Node 2 is connected to node 4.\\n- Node 4 is connected to node 3.\\n- Node 3 is connected to node 5.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->4->3->5\""}]
