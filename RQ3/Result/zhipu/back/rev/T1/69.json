BFS explores the graph level by level, beginning at a single node (the starting point) and exploring all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nThe steps for BFS are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target, the path to this node is the shortest path from the start.\\n4. If the node is not the target, enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors, along with the path to reach them.\\n5. Mark the node as visited.\\n6.
