BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores nodes layer by layer, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has done so by traversing the shortest possible path.\\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works as follows:\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, backtrack to find the path and return it.\\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet, and mark them as visited.\\n3.

Node 0 has no direct connection to node 6, so we look at its neighbors, but since they are not on the direct path to 6, we continue.\\n4. We dequeue node 1. Node 1 also has no direct connection to node 6, so we move on.\\n5. We dequeue node 5. Node 5 has a direct connection to node 6, which is our target.
