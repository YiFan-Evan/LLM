BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the shortest path to any node is found before moving on to nodes that are further away. When a node is visited, BFS also keeps track of the path taken to reach that node. Here is how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set to keep track of nodes that have been visited and the nodes that are in the queue to be visited.\\n2. Start with the initial node, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node.\\n   b. If this node is the target, reconstruct the path from the start node to the target node by following the chain of predecessors.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its unvisited neighbors, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Remember to keep track of which node led to the visitation of this neighbor (the predecessor).\\n4. If the queue is empty and the target has not been reached, there is no path from the start to the target.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n- Edges: [[0, 4], [1, 6], [2, 5], [3, 4], [4, 5], [4, 6], [6, 7]]\\n\\nStarting at node 0, we will follow the BFS procedure:\\n\\n1. Enqueue node 0.\\n2. Dequeue node 0, and enqueue its neighbors: [4].\\n3. Dequeue node 4.
