BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we first reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node from the starting point.\\n\\nThe steps for BFS are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n3. If the dequeued node is the target node, we have found our shortest path.\\n4.
