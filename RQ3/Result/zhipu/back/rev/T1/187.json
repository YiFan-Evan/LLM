This algorithm works by repeatedly picking the vertex with the smallest distance from the start point that has not been visited yet, and updating the distances to its adjacent vertices. However, since you've asked for the shortest path without specifying the type of graph (weighted or unweighted), I'll assume it's an unweighted graph and use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is suitable for unweighted graphs to find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node and mark it as visited.\\n   b. If this node is the target, reconstruct the path from the start node to the target by backtracking.\\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited adjacent nodes.\\n3. Once the target node is dequeued and the path is reconstructed, the search is complete.\\n\\nGiven the graph provided and using BFS, we would do the following:\\n\\n1. Start at node 12.\\n2. Explore all its neighbors (nodes 7, 23, and 15).\\n3. From those neighbors, explore their neighbors, and so on, until we reach node 1.\\n4. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\\n5. Once we reach node 1, we backtrack to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's perform this algorithm step by step:\\n\\nStarting at node 12, we explore nodes 7, 23, and 15. From node 15, we can reach node 16, and from node 16, we reach node 19. From node 19, there's no direct path to node 1, so we go back to node 15 and try another path. From node 15, we can also reach node 18, and from node 18, we reach node 21.
