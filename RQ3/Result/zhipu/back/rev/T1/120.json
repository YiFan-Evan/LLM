The algorithm works by keeping track of the current shortest distance from the start node to each visited node and updating these distances as it discovers new nodes. It uses a priority queue to determine the next node to visit based on the shortest distance from the start node.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of the steps in Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark the start node as visited and set its distance to 0.\\n2. Set the initial distances to all other nodes to infinity.\\n3. While there are unvisited nodes:\\n   a. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance from the start node.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance from the start node through the current node.\\n   c. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and set the current node as the previous node for this neighbor.\\n4. Once the destination node has been visited, backtrack from the destination node to the start node using the recorded previous nodes to find the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given graph with the start node 7 and the destination node 12.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\\n- Edges: [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 14], [2, 3], [3, 7], [4, 13], [5, 12], [5, 6], [6, 13], [6, 7], [8, 10], [8, 14], [9, 12], [11, 12]]\\n\\nWe would apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 7 to node 12.\\n\\nAfter running the algorithm, we would discover that the shortest path from node 7 to node 12 is through node 6. Since node 6 is connected to node 7 and node 6 is also connected to node 12, we can simply trace the path from node 7 to node 6 and then from node 6 to node 12.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->6->12\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 14], [2, 3], [3, 7], [4, 13], [5, 12], [5, 6], [6, 13], [6, 7], [8, 10], [8, 14], [9, 12], [11, 12]]} The end node: 12 The start node: 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.
