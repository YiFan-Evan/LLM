Both algorithms are suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Since the problem does not specify whether the graph is weighted or not, I will assume it is unweighted and use BFS, which is typically used for this purpose.\\n\\nBFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point). It keeps track of the nodes that have been visited and the distance from the start node to each visited node. It also keeps track of the parent of each node, which allows us to reconstruct the path once we reach the target node.\\n\\nHere is a step-by-step explanation of the BFS algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the queue.\\n   b. If this node has not been visited, mark it as visited.\\n   c. For each neighbor of this node that has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n4. Once the target node is dequeued, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent pointers to construct the shortest path.\\n5.
