BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path from the start node to the target node. The algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to explore, and a dictionary (or an array) to keep track of the parent of each node, which helps in reconstructing the path once the target is reached.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of the BFS algorithm applied to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, stop the search.\\n   c.

Dequeue 24, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: no neighbors that lead directly to 17.\\n7. Go back to the queue and continue with the next node, which leads us back to node 14, and we continue exploring its other neighbors.\\n8.
