The BFS algorithm explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (in this case, the starting point), and keeps track of all the visited nodes and their paths. \\n\\nHere's how BFS works:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the paths.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target node, reconstruct the path from the starting node to the target node using the dictionary.\\n4.

Enqueue node 7 with the path 4->7, and since node 3 is already connected to node 4, it's enqueued with the path 4->3.\\n- Dequeue node 3. Node 3 has edges to nodes 5 and 4 (which is the node from which it came, so we skip it).\\n- Dequeue node 7. Node 7 has edges to nodes 2 and 4 (which is the node from which it came, so we skip it).\\n- Enqueue node 2 with the path 7->2.\\n- Dequeue node 2. Node 2 has an edge to node 1, which we enqueue with the path 2->1.\\n- Dequeue node 5 (reached from node 3). Node 5 has an edge to node 7, which we have already visited, and an edge to node 6, which is our target.\\n- Enqueue node 6 with the path 5->6.\\n\\nWhen we dequeue node 6, we find that it is our target node, and we can reconstruct the path from the dictionary. The path to node 6 is 5->6, but we need to go back to find the full path from node 4 to node 6.
