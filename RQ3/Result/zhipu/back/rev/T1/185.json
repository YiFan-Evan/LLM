BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next vertex to visit. For finding the shortest path, BFS is beneficial because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is reached by the shortest path from the starting node.\\n\\nHere are the steps involved in using BFS to find the shortest path from a start node to a target node:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. The queue will hold the nodes to be visited next, and the visited set will keep track of which nodes have been visited to prevent cycles.\\n2. Enqueue the start node.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node and mark it as visited.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, stop the search.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited, enqueue them and record the node from which they were reached.\\n4. Once the target node is reached, backtrack using the recorded nodes from step 3c to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nNow let's apply BFS to the provided graph to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 12:\\n\\n```python\\nfrom collections import deque\\n\\n# Define the graph\\nnodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]\\nedges = [[0, 16], [0, 24], [1, 3], [2, 10], [3, 19], [3, 12], [4, 7], [4, 20], [5, 6], [5, 13], [5, 21], [8, 21], [9, 15], [10, 20], [10, 16], [11, 17], [11, 14], [12, 15], [13, 22], [14, 21], [15, 16], [18, 21], [18, 20], [20, 23]]\\ngraph = {node: [] for node in nodes}\\nfor edge in edges:\\n    graph[edge[0]].append(edge[1])\\n    graph[edge[1]].append(edge[0])\\n\\n# Define the BFS function\\ndef bfs_shortest_path(graph, start, end):\\n    queue = deque([start])\\n    visited = set([start])\\n    parents = {start: None}\\n    \\n    while queue:\\n        current = queue.popleft()\\n        if current == end:\\n            break\\n        for neighbor in graph[current]:\\n            if neighbor not in visited:\\n                queue.append(neighbor)\\n                visited.add(neighbor)\\n                parents[neighbor] = current\\n    \\n    # Reconstruct the shortest path\\n    path = deque()\\n    current = end\\n    while current is not None:\\n        path.appendleft(current)\\n        current = parents[current]\\n    return \\\"->\\\".join(map(str, path))\\n\\n# Find the shortest path from node 8 to node 12\\nshortest_path = bfs_shortest_path(graph, 8, 12)\\n```\\n\\nIf we run this code, it will return the shortest path from node 8 to node 12.
