BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path to each vertex is found before moving on to vertices that are further away. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the next vertex to explore, and it also maintains an array or dictionary to record the shortest path to each vertex.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm applied to find the shortest path from a start node to a target node:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, stop the search.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each adjacent node:\\n      i. If it has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\\n      ii. Record the node from which this adjacent node was reached (this helps reconstruct the path later).\\n3. Once the target node is dequeued, backtrack using the recorded nodes to construct the shortest path from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nNow let's apply this to the given graph, starting from node 16 and aiming to reach node 18:\\n\\n1. Start from node 16, and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue node 16 and explore its neighbors. From the given edges, we see that node 16 is connected to node 11.\\n3.

Skip node 16 since it's already visited, enqueue nodes 22 and 8.\\n6. Dequeue node 22 and explore its neighbors. Node 22 is connected to node 11 (visited) and node 16 (visited), so skip it.\\n7. Dequeue node 8 and explore its neighbors. Node 8 is connected to nodes 17 and 11 (visited). Enqueue node 17.\\n8. Dequeue node 17 and explore its neighbors. Node 17 is connected to node 8 (visited) and node 0. Since node 18 is not a neighbor of node 17, continue with node 0.\\n9. Enqueue node 0 since it's unvisited.\\n10. Dequeue node 0 and explore its neighbors. Node 0 is connected to nodes 18 and 17 (visited).
