BFS is a traversing algorithm for graphs that starts at a selected node and explores all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes that need to be explored. BFS is particularly useful for finding the shortest path on an unweighted graph because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is done so with the shortest path from the starting node.\\n\\nHere are the steps of the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node.\\n2. Keep a set or a dictionary to track visited nodes and their parents to reconstruct the path later.\\n3. Dequeue a node from the queue and examine it.\\n4. If the current node is the target node, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the parent nodes.\\n5. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the current node, recording their parent as the current node.\\n6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 21 and the destination node 2.\\n\\nGiven the graph's structure, we'll perform BFS as follows:\\n\\n- Start at node 21, and explore its neighbors: 5, 9, 21 (which is itself, so we skip it).\\n- Move to node 5 and explore its neighbors: 6, 9, 21 (already visited).\\n- Move to node 6 and explore its neighbors: no unvisited neighbors.\\n- Move to node 9 and explore its neighbors: no unvisited neighbors.\\n- At this point, we have to backtrack to find unexplored paths.\\n- Back to node 5, we already visited all neighbors, so we go back further.\\n- Back to node 21, we explore its unvisited neighbors: 5 (visited), 9 (visited), and then we reach node 2.\\n\\nThe path from node 21 to node 2 is 21 -> 5 -> 2.
