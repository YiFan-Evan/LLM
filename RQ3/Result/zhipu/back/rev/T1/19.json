However, since we only need the shortest path from the start node to the target node, we can adapt it to stop once the target node is reached.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\nGraph:\\nNodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\nEdges: 0-5, 1-6, 2-3, 2-5, 2-7, 4-7, 5-6\\n\\nStart node: 3\\nDestination: 5\\n\\nWe'll start at node 3, with a distance of 0 and all other nodes having a distance of infinity. Then we'll update the distances of the neighbors of node 3 and continue with the node that has the smallest distance until we reach node 5.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process applied to our specific graph:\\n\\n1. Start at node 3, distance to node 3 is 0.\\n2. Node 3 is connected to node 2 with an edge. Update the distance to node 2 to be 1 (assuming edge weights are 1 for simplicity).\\n3. Now, consider node 2. It's connected to nodes 3, 5, and 7. Update their distances if the new distance (current distance to node 2 + edge weight) is smaller than the current tentative distance.\\n4. Continue this process, always moving to the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance.\\n5. When we reach node 5, we stop, as we've found our shortest path.\\n\\nLet's simulate the algorithm:\\n\\n- Start at node 3 (distance 0).\\n- Update node 2 (distance 1 via node 3).\\n- Move to node 2 (distance 1).\\n- Update node 3 (distance remains 0 since it's the start), node 5 (distance 2 via node 2), and node 7 (distance 3 via node 2).\\n- Move to node 5 (distance 2).\\n- Node 5 is the destination, and we stop here.\\n\\nNow, to reconstruct the path, we'd need to keep track of the previous node that led us to each node.
