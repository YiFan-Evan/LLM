BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found. It starts at the source node and explores all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially just the start node).\\n2. Dequeue the first element of the queue and examine it.\\n3. If the current node is the destination node, the path to this node is the shortest path.\\n4. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited, enqueue it along with the path that led to it.\\n5. Repeat this process until the queue is empty or the destination is found.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 7:\\n\\n1. Start at node 0, enqueue it: [(0, [0])]\\n2. Dequeue node 0, examine it. Node 0 has edges to nodes 3 and 4. Enqueue these nodes with the path: [(3, [0, 3]), (4, [0, 4])]\\n3. Dequeue node 3, examine it. Node 3 has edges to nodes 5 and 8. Enqueue these nodes with the path: [(5, [0, 3, 5]), (8, [0, 3, 8])]\\n4. Dequeue node 4, examine it. Node 4 has an edge to node 12. Enqueue this node with the path: [(12, [0, 4, 12])]\\n5. Dequeue node 5, examine it. Node 5 has an edge to node 9. Enqueue this node with the path: [(9, [0, 3, 5, 9])]\\n6. Dequeue node 8, examine it. Node 8 has an edge to node 10. Enqueue this node with the path: [(10, [0, 3, 8, 10])]\\n7. Dequeue node 12, examine it. Node 12 is not the destination, but it doesn't have any edges leading to the destination node 7 either, so we continue.\\n8. Dequeue node 9, examine it. Node 9 doesn't have an edge to the destination node 7.\\n9. Dequeue node 10, examine it. Node 10 doesn't have an edge to the destination node 7.\\n10. At this point, we realize that we need to backtrack to node 2, which is connected to node 7. Node 2 was enqueued in step 1 but was not explored yet because we explored all nodes at the current depth level first.\\n11. Dequeue node 2, examine it. Node 2 has edges to nodes 7 and 11.
