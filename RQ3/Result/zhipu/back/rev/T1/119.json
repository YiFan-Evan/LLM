The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to explore, and it marks each node as visited once it has been explored to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. If the dequeued node is the target node, the path to this node is the shortest path.\\n4. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, enqueue the neighbor along with the path to reach it (the current path plus the neighbor).\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 5 and the destination node 3:\\n\\n1. Enqueue start node 5 with path [5].\\n2. Dequeue node 5, examine it. Since 5 is not the target, enqueue its unvisited neighbors (4 and 11) with paths [5, 4] and [5, 11].\\n3. Dequeue node 4, examine it. Since 4 is not the target, enqueue its unvisited neighbors (3 and 8) with paths [5, 4, 3] and [5, 4, 8].\\n4. Dequeue node 3, which is the target.
