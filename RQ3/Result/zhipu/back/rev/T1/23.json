BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point), and it guarantees that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node. For weighted graphs, Dijkstra's algorithm or A* might be used, but since all edges can be assumed to have equal weight in this case, BFS is appropriate.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works in the context of this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set or dictionary to track visited nodes and their parents to reconstruct the path later.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and add all its unvisited neighbors to the back of the queue.\\n4. For each neighbor, record the current node as its parent.\\n5. Once the target node is dequeued, the shortest path can be reconstructed by following the parent links from the target node back to the start node.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 3 and the destination node 6:\\n\\n1. Start with node 3 in the queue.\\n2. Visit node 3 and add its unvisited neighbors (5) to the queue.\\n3. Visit node 5 and add its unvisited neighbors (6) to the queue.\\n4. Visit node 6.

Reconstruct the path from node 6 to node 3 by following the parent links.\\n\\nGiven that we only have the list of edges and no information about the direction, we'll assume the graph is undirected, meaning each edge works in both directions.\\n\\nNow, let's find the shortest path from node 3 to node 6:\\n\\n- Node 3 has one edge to node 5.\\n- Node 5 has one edge to node 6, which is the target.\\n\\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 6 is: 3->5->6\\n\\nThus, the final answer is: 3->5->6\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 5], [5, 6], [6, 7]]} The end node: 6 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"As previously explained, to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
