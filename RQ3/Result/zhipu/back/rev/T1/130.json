This algorithm works by repeatedly picking the vertex with the minimal distance from the starting point that has not been included in the shortest path tree yet. It updates the distances to the neighboring vertices and continues this process until the target vertex is reached or all vertices are included in the shortest path tree.\\n\\nHere are the steps for Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has a weight of 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nLet's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph:\\n\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 11], [2, 11], [2, 6], [2, 13], [3, 7], [4, 8], [5, 10], [5, 8], [6, 12], [7, 8], [7, 14], [8, 9], [10, 13]]}\\nStart node: 6\\nDestination: 10\\n\\nUsing the algorithm, we start at node 6 with a distance of 0 and update the distances of its neighbors.
