BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores vertices layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found. It does this by maintaining a queue of nodes to be explored and a set of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\\n\\nHere are the steps of the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path leading to it (initially just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the node from the front of the queue.\\n3. Check if this node is the target node. If it is, we have found the shortest path.\\n4. If not, for each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, and enqueue it along with the updated path.\\n5.
