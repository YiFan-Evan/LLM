BFS is particularly suitable for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path.\\n\\nThe fundamental principles of BFS are as follows:\\n\\n1. Start from the initial node and insert it into a queue.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and insert all of its adjacent nodes into the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\\n3. Keep track of the nodes' parents to reconstruct the path later.\\n4. When the target node is dequeued, the search can stop, as BFS guarantees that the first time the target is reached is via the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the provided graph to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 3.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]\\n- Edges: [[0, 9], [0, 6], [1, 7], [1, 9], [2, 4], [3, 10], [3, 11], [3, 8], [4, 11], [5, 9], [6, 8], [6, 12]]\\n\\nWe begin BFS from node 8:\\n\\n1.

Enqueue node 9 and 12 (again, if not visited).\\n4. Dequeue node 12, mark it as visited. Node 3 is not adjacent to node 12, so we continue.\\n5. Dequeue node 9, mark it as visited. Node 3 is not adjacent to node 9, so we continue. Enqueue nodes 0, 1, and 5.\\n6. Continue this process until node 3 is dequeued.\\n\\nTracking the parents of each node, we reconstruct the path back to the start node once we reach the target node 3.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (8).\\n2. Keep a set to track visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Maintain a dictionary to track the parent of each node. This will help in reconstructing the path once the target is reached.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front node and process its neighbors.\\n5. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n6.
