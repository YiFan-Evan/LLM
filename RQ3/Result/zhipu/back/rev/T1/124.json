The BFS algorithm explores the graph level by level, starting from the source node. It keeps track of all the nodes that have been visited and the shortest path to each visited node.\\n\\nHere are the steps involved in the BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (parent pointers).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Also, record the parent of this neighbor (which is the node from which it was dequeued).\\n4. Continue this process until the queue is empty or the target node is dequeued.\\n5. Once the target node is found, backtrack through the parent pointers to reconstruct the shortest path from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 4 and the destination node 1.\\n\\nApplying BFS:\\n\\n- Start with node 4, enqueue it, and mark it as visited.\\n- Dequeue node 4 and examine its neighbors: since the destination node 1 is not a direct neighbor of 4, enqueue the neighbors (assuming they haven't been visited yet).\\n- Continue with the next node in the queue, and repeat the process until you dequeue node 1.\\n\\nHere's how we would implement it in pseudocode:\\n\\n```\\nqueue = enqueue(start_node)\\nvisited = set()\\nparents = {node: None for node in nodes}  # Dictionary to store the parent of each node\\n\\nwhile queue is not empty:\\n    current_node = dequeue(queue)\\n    if current_node not in visited:\\n        visited.add(current_node)\\n        for neighbor in graph.neighbors(current_node):\\n            if neighbor not in visited:\\n                queue.enqueue(neighbor)\\n                parents[neighbor] = current_node\\n    if current_node == destination:\\n        break\\n```\\n\\nAfter running BFS, we'd have the parent pointers established for each node. Then, starting from the destination node (1), we'd backtrack using the parent pointers to find the shortest path to the start node (4).\\n\\nSince I can't execute code, I'll describe the process:\\n\\n1. Node 4 is enqueued.\\n2. Node 4 is dequeued, and its neighbors (1, 2, 6, 11, 12) are enqueued (assuming they are not already visited).\\n3. Node 1 is found and dequeued, so we stop.\\n\\nNow, we backtrack from node 1 to node 4 using the parent pointers to find the shortest path.\\n\\nUnfortunately, without the ability to execute code, I cannot provide the exact shortest path. However, given the structure of BFS and the graph provided, you could implement this algorithm in a programming language of your choice to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 1.\\n\\nIf we were to continue the BFS process manually, we would find that the shortest path from node 4 to node 1 is 4->1 because node 1 is directly connected to node 4.
