BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we first reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node. This is because BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for our purpose:\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, keep a dictionary to record the parent of each node. This will help us backtrack the shortest path once we reach the target node.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue.\\n5. Record the parent of each neighbor as the node from which it was reached.\\n6. If we reach the target node, we can stop and backtrack through the parent references to find the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 9:\\n\\n1. Start with node 3 in the queue.\\n2. Node 3 has neighbors 11 and 4. Node 11 is visited first because it is enqueued first.\\n3. From node 11, we visit node 0 (which is not in the queue yet).\\n4. From node 4, we visit node 12 (which is not in the queue yet).\\n5. Node 0 has neighbors 9 and 11, but since 11 is already visited, we only enqueue 9.\\n6. At this point, we have reached the target node 9 in the shortest path.\\n\\nNow we backtrack from node 9 to find the full path:\\n- The parent of 9 is 0.\\n- The parent of 0 is 3 (since we visited 0 from 3).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->0->9\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 11], [1, 7], [1, 12], [2, 5], [2, 8], [3, 11], [3, 4], [4, 8], [4, 12], [6, 9], [10, 11]]} The end node: 9 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"As previously explained, we will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node (3) to the end node (9).
