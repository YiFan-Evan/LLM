BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node from the starting point. This is because BFS will visit all the neighbors of a node before moving on to nodes that are further away.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of the BFS algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, reconstruct the path from the start to the target using a parent map.\\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighbors of this node and mark them as visited. Also, record the parent of each neighbor to reconstruct the path later.\\n4. If the queue becomes empty and the target has not been reached, there is no path from the start to the target.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the provided graph and find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n- Edges: [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 3], [1, 5], [1, 7], [2, 4], [5, 6]]\\n\\nStarting at node 1, we will explore its neighbors (0, 3, 5, 7).
