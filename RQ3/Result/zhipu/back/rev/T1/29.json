BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Start at the initial node and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n4. If not, enqueue all of its neighbors that have not been visited yet.\\n5. Mark the node as visited to avoid processing it again.\\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until the queue is empty or the target is found.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3:\\n\\n- Start at node 1, enqueue it.\\n- Dequeue node 1, it has edges to nodes 6 and 7, enqueue them.\\n- Dequeue node 6, it has an edge to node 7, enqueue it (node 7 is already in the queue).\\n- Dequeue node 7, it has edges to nodes 1 and 2, but node 1 is already visited, so we only enqueue node 2.\\n- Dequeue node 2, it has edges to nodes 3 and 7, we enqueue node 3 (node 7 is already visited).\\n- Dequeue node 3, it is the target node, and we stop here.\\n\\nThe path followed is 1->7->2->3.
