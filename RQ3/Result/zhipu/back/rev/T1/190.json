BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path from the starting node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works in the context of finding the shortest path:\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add the starting node to the queue and mark it as visited.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, reconstruct the path from the starting node to the target node using a parent map, which keeps track of each node's parent.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of the node's neighbors that haven't been visited, mark them as visited, add them to the queue, and record their parent.\\n3.
