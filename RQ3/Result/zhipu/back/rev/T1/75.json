BFS is well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node from the starting point.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add the starting node to the queue.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n3. If the node is the target, we've found our shortest path.\\n4. Otherwise, mark the node as visited, and for each of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited, add them to the queue.\\n5. To reconstruct the path, we can keep track of the parent of each node as we visit it.\\n\\nGiven the graph and the start and destination nodes, let's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3:\\n\\n```\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 6]]}\\nStart node: 1\\nDestination: 3\\n```\\n\\nUsing BFS, we'll start at node 1, visit node 2 next (since it's the only neighbor of 1), and from node 2, we'll visit node 4. We won't visit nodes 0, 5, 6, or 7 because they are not reachable in a single step from node 1. However, we'll find that node 3 is not directly reachable from node 1 or node 2. Since there are no other nodes to visit from node 2, we backtrack. We realize that we haven't visited node 5 from node 3, which leads us to node 3. At this point, we have found the shortest path from node 1 to node 3.\\n\\nThe shortest path in this case is 1->2->4->3.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->2->4->3. \\n\\nHowever, it seems there might be a mistake in the provided graph structure because according to the given edges, node 3 is not reachable from node 1 directly or through any intermediate nodes. The path 1->2->4->3 is the shortest path based on the nodes and edges provided, but it does not lead to node 3. There might be a missing edge that connects node 4 to node 3, which would be necessary to reach the destination node 3 from the start node 1.
