The BFS algorithm explores the graph level by level, starting from the source node, and keeps track of the shortest path found to each node it visits.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (parent pointers).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node and check if it is the target node. If it is, reconstruct the path by following the parent pointers.\\n   b. If it is not the target node, enqueue all of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet, and update their parent pointers.\\n3.

Dequeue node 6, and enqueue its neighbor 2, setting its parent to 6.\\n7. Dequeue node 2, which is the target node.
