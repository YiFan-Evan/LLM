BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path since all edges have the same weight. Here's a brief explanation of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to track visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all its unvisited neighboring nodes, marking them as visited.\\n4.

The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to explore, and it ensures that the first time we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how we would apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5:\\n\\n1.
