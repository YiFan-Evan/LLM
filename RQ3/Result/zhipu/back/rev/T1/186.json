The algorithm works by keeping a priority queue of all nodes that have not been visited yet, and it continually selects the unvisited node that is estimated to be closest to the starting point. It then updates the distances to the neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark the distance to the starting node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.\\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited, the algorithm can terminate, as the shortest path has been found.\\n6.

However, since we only need the shortest path from the start node to the end node, we can adapt the algorithm to stop once the destination is reached.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of the adapted Dijkstra's algorithm for our specific case:\\n\\n1. Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes having an infinite distance except for the start node, which has a distance of 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a min-heap) and insert the start node with its distance.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\\n   b. If this node is the destination node, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance from the start node through this node to the neighbor.\\n   d. If this distance is shorter than the currently recorded distance for the neighbor, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\\n4. Once the destination node is dequeued from the priority queue, backtrack from the destination node to the start node using a parent pointer or a predecessor map to reconstruct the path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given graph, starting from node 19 and aiming to reach node 22.\\n\\n- We start at node 19, setting its distance to 0.\\n- We examine node 19's neighbors, which are nodes 2 and 5.
