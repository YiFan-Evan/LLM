This algorithm is a common approach to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting point, until it reaches the target point. Here's a brief overview of the steps involved:\\n\\n1. Mark the starting node with a distance of 0 and all other nodes with a distance of infinity.\\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited.\\n5. If the destination node has been marked as visited, we have found the shortest path.\\n6. Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 3.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the provided graph and find the shortest path from node 9 to node 7.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12\\n- Edges: [0, 12], [1, 10], [2, 3], [3, 11], [3, 7], [4, 10], [4, 7], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 9], [6, 8], [8, 12]\\n\\nStarting at node 9 and looking for the shortest path to node 7:\\n\\n1. Node 9 has no direct edges to any other nodes except for node 6.\\n2. We move to node 6, which has edges to nodes 9, 8, and 5.\\n3. From node 6, we can go to node 8 or node 5.\\n4. Node 8 has an edge to node 12, which is not our target, so we choose node 5.\\n5. Node 5 has an edge to node 6, but also to node 4.\\n6. Node 4 has edges to nodes 10, 7, and 5.
