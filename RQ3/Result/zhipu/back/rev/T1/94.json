BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed from the source node to the target node. \\n\\nHere's how BFS works for our purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. For each node, add its neighbors to the queue if they haven't been visited yet.\\n4. Keep track of the previous node for each visited node so that we can reconstruct the path once we reach the target node.\\n5.

From node 8, we can reach node 1 through node 12 and then node 1.

Start from node 10, enqueue it, and mark it as visited.\\n2. Dequeue node 10 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors. According to the graph, node 10 has no direct neighbors, so we move to the next node in the queue.\\n3.
