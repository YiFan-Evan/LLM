BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed from the source to the destination.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. We start at the source node and enqueue it.\\n2. We mark the source node as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\\n4. For each unvisited neighbor, we mark it as visited and enqueue it. We also record the node from which we arrived at this neighbor, which allows us to reconstruct the path later.\\n5.
