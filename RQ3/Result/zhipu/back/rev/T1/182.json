The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to explore and maintains a set or a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node that has been visited.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS in the context of finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a dictionary to track visited nodes and their shortest path from the start node.\\n3. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n4. For each unvisited neighbor of this node, calculate the path to that neighbor and enqueue it.\\n5. Mark the node as visited once it's dequeued.\\n6. Stop when the target node is dequeued or the queue is empty (which means no path exists).\\n7.
