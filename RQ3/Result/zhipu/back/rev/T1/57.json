BFS is a traversal algorithm for graphs that explores all the vertices of a graph at their respective levels, meaning it explores all the neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic makes BFS particularly useful for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs like the one provided.\\n\\nThe steps of the BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path are:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, reconstruct the path from the start to the target by backtracking through the shortest path dictionary.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of the node's neighbors that have not been visited, mark it as visited, record the node that led to its discovery, and enqueue it.\\n3.
