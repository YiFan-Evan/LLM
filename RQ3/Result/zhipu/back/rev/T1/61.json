Start with node 2 in the queue and an empty path dictionary.\\n2. Dequeue node 2, and mark it as visited. Look at its neighbors (0 and 7).\\n3. Enqueue the unvisited neighbors 0 and 7, and record in the path dictionary that the shortest path to 0 and 7 is through node 2.\\n4. Dequeue node 0 next, and look at its neighbors (2 and 7).
