BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the source node. It keeps track of the nodes that have been visited and the distance from the source node to each visited node. Since the graph is unweighted, the shortest path in terms of the number of edges is what we're looking for.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works in this context:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, maintain a dictionary to store the parent of each node. This will help in reconstructing the path once we reach the target node.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, remove a node from the front of the queue and mark it as visited.\\n5. For each edge from the current node, if the destination node of the edge has not been visited, add it to the queue, mark it as visited, and record its parent.\\n6. If the target node is dequeued, reconstruct the path by following the parent pointers from the target node back to the start node.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 4.\\n\\nGiven graph: \\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\nEdges: [[0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 6], [1, 2], [2, 7], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\\n\\nStarting node: 5\\nDestination node: 4\\n\\nWe perform BFS starting from node 5, and we reach node 4.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (node 5).\\n2. Keep a set or dictionary to track visited nodes and their parents to reconstruct the path later.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\\n4. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n5. If the end node (node 4) is dequeued, stop and reconstruct the path using the parent pointers.\\n\\nNow, applying BFS to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 5, which has an edge to node 6.\\n- Move to node 6, which has an edge to node 7.\\n- Move to node 7, which has an edge to node 4.\\n\\nThus, the shortest path from node 5 to node 4 is 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 4.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->6->7->4\""}]
