BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path since all edges can be considered to have the same weight (or cost).\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node).\\n2. Dequeue the first element (node and path) from the queue.\\n3. Check if the current node is the target node. If it is, the path leading to it is the shortest path, and we can return it.\\n4. If the current node is not the target, for each of its adjacent nodes, enqueue them along with the path extended by that node.\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 5 and the destination node 4.\\n\\n1. Start with the node 5, and enqueue it with the path [5].\\n2. Dequeue node 5, and examine its edges. Node 5 is connected to node 1 and node 7.\\n3. Enqueue nodes 1 and 7 with the path [5, 1] and [5, 7] respectively.\\n4. Dequeue node 1 next. It's connected to node 5 and node 7. Node 7 has already been visited in the path [5, 7], so we only consider node 5, but since we came from node 5, we do not need to visit it again.\\n5. Dequeue node 7. It's connected to nodes 1, 3, and 6. Node 1 has already been visited, so we look at nodes 3 and 6. We enqueue node 3 with the path [5, 7, 3] and node 6 with the path [5, 7, 6].\\n6. Dequeue node 3. It's connected to nodes 0, 2, and 7. We have already visited node 7, so we look at nodes 0 and 2. Node 0 is not on the path to node 4, so we consider node 2 and enqueue it with the path [5, 7, 3, 2].\\n7. Dequeue node 6. It has no connection to node 4, so we continue.\\n8. Dequeue node 2. It's connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6. We have already visited nodes 3 and 6, so we consider node 4, which is our destination.\\n\\nAt this point, we have reached the destination node 4 with the path [5, 7, 3, 2, 4]. Since all the edges are unweighted, this is the shortest path.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->7->3->2->4\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 5], [1, 7], [2, 4], [2, 3], [3, 7], [6, 7]]} The end node: 4 The start node: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"I apologize for the confusion in the previous response.

Node 6 is connected to node 7, which has already been visited, and there is no direct connection to node 4, so we continue.\\n8. Dequeue node 2. Node 2 is connected to nodes 3, 4, and 6.
