To solve this, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n1. Start from the initial node and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue a node and mark it as visited. Add all its adjacent nodes to the queue that have not been visited yet.\\n3. Repeat the process until the queue is empty or the target node is dequeued.\\n4.

The BFS algorithm operates by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

If an adjacent node has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent (the node from which it was reached), and enqueue it.\\n3.
