BFS explores the graph level by level, beginning with the starting node and exploring all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nThe steps for BFS to find the shortest path are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (parent or predecessor mapping).\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n3. If the current node is the target, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target node to the start node using the parent mapping.\\n4. Otherwise, for each of the current node's neighbors that have not been visited, add them to the queue and record the current node as their parent.\\n5.

Visit node 9 (starting node), add it to the queue.\\n2. Node 9 has edges to nodes 0 and 6, but we start with node 0 since it was added to the queue first.\\n3. Visit node 0, add its neighbors (6 and 9) to the queue (9 is already in the queue so we skip it).\\n4. Visit node 6, add its neighbor (node 5) to the queue.\\n5. Visit node 5, add its neighbor (node 6) to the queue (it's already visited, so we skip it).\\n6. Visit node 10, which is a neighbor of node 2, and add its neighbors (nodes 5 and 2) to the queue.\\n7. Visit node 2, which has a direct edge to node 3, our target.

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. Since the graph is unweighted, each edge has a weight of 1, which makes Dijkstra's algorithm applicable.\\n\\nThe algorithm works as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes having an infinite distance except the start node, which has a distance of 0.\\n2. Create a priority queue (or a min-heap) and insert the start node with its distance.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Extract the node with the minimum distance.\\n   b.

Node 0 is extracted next (smallest distance), and it has an edge to 6. However, going through 0 to 6 is not shorter than the direct path from 9 to 6, so we skip updating.\\n5.
