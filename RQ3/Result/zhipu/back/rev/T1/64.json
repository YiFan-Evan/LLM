BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found. The algorithm works by maintaining a queue of nodes to explore and a set or dictionary to keep track of the nodes visited and their parents (the node from which they were discovered).\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Initialize a dictionary to store the parent of each node.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, reconstruct the path by following the parent links from the target to the start.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node, if the neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n4.
