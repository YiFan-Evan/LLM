BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node from the starting point. The algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the next nodes to explore and a dictionary (or list) to keep track of the parent of each node, which allows us to reconstruct the path once we reach the destination.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node.\\n2. Keep a record of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. If it's the destination node, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the parent nodes.\\n    c. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes and mark them as visited, recording their parent.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n1. We start at node 6.\\n2. We enqueue node 6 and mark it as visited.\\n3. We dequeue node 6 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 7 and 12.\\n4. We dequeue node 7 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 0 and 14.\\n5.
