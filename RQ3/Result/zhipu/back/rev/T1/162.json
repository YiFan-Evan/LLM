Dijkstra's algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex, until it reaches the target vertex. It keeps a set of unvisited vertices and calculates tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\\n1. Mark the starting node with a distance of 0 and all other nodes with a distance of infinity.\\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n5. If the destination node has been marked visited, the algorithm stops. The shortest path to the destination is found.\\n6.
