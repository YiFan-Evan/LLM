BFS explores the graph level by level, beginning with the starting node, and keeps track of the shortest path to each node it visits. It uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited next and a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to track the shortest path to each node, with the starting node's path being just itself.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. For each neighbor of this node that has not been visited:\\n        i. Mark it as visited.\\n        ii. Add the neighbor to the queue.\\n        iii. Update the shortest path to the neighbor by appending the current node to the path.\\n3. Once we've reached the destination node, the path in the dictionary will be the shortest path from the start node to the destination.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\nGiven graph:\\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\nEdges: [[0, 7], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]\\n\\nStarting node: 2\\nDestination: 3\\n\\nUsing BFS, we find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3:\\n\\n1.

Visit node 0 and examine its neighbors: 7 (node 7 is already visited).\\n7. Visit node 5 and examine its neighbors: 6, 7 (node 7 is already visited, node 6 is not connected to node 3).\\n8. Since we cannot reach node 3 from node 6 or 0, we backtrack and find that we haven't explored node 4 yet (neighbor of node 1 which is a neighbor of node 2).\\n9. Enqueue node 4.\\n10.

Let's solve the problem with the correct start and end nodes provided this time: start node 2 and end node 3.\\n\\nTo find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3, we will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm as it is suitable for unweighted graphs like the one provided. BFS will help us find the shortest path by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's how we would implement BFS for this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node (2) to it.\\n2. Keep a set to track visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Keep a dictionary to track the parent of each node, which will help us reconstruct the path once we reach the target node.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\nGiven graph:\\nNodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\nEdges: [[0, 7], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]\\n\\nStarting node: 2\\nDestination: 3\\n\\nUsing BFS:\\n1.
