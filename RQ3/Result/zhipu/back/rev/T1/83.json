BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. This characteristic makes it suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, as it ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is done via the shortest path from the source.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node and mark it as visited.\\n   b. If this node is the target, the path to this node is the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited adjacent nodes of this node.\\n4.
