Initialize a queue and a visited set to keep track of nodes to visit and nodes that have been visited.\\n2. Enqueue the starting node and mark it as visited.\\n3.

Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited, mark them as visited, enqueue them, and record the node from which they were reached (this helps in reconstructing the path later).\\n4.
