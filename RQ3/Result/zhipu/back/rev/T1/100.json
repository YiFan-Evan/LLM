The BFS algorithm explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point). It keeps track of all the visited nodes and the distance from the start node to each visited node. It also maintains a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored and a predecessor map to reconstruct the path once the target node is reached.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set or a dictionary to track visited nodes and their distances from the start node.\\n3. Dequeue a node from the queue and explore its neighbors.\\n4. For each unvisited neighbor, set its distance and enqueue it.\\n5. Keep a predecessor map to store the parent of each visited node.\\n6. Once the target node is dequeued, backtrack using the predecessor map to construct the shortest path from the target node to the start node.\\n7.

Start from node 6, enqueue it and mark it as visited.\\n2. Explore its neighbors: 4 and 2 are neighbors of 6. Node 2 is the destination, so we stop here.\\n3.
