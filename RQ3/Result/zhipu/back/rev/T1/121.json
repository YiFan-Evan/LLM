BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point), and it is guaranteed to find the shortest path to each node it explores because it checks all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for our purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (parent pointers).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, we stop and backtrack using the parent pointers to find the shortest path.\\n   c.

Once we reach the target node or exhaust the queue, backtrack using the parent pointers to construct the shortest path from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node as 2 and the destination as 4:\\n\\n1. Start at node 2, enqueue it, and mark it as visited.\\n2. Dequeue node 2, and explore its neighbors: there are no direct edges to node 4, so we enqueue its neighbors (0, 10) and mark them as visited.\\n3. Next, we dequeue node 0. Node 4 is not a neighbor of node 0, so we enqueue its neighbors (1, 11, 10) and mark them as visited.\\n4. Dequeue node 10. Node 4 is not a neighbor of node 10 either, but node 4 is connected to node 10 through another node, so we enqueue its neighbors (2, 12) and mark them as visited.\\n5. Dequeue node 3. Node 4 is a direct neighbor of node 3, so we enqueue node 4 and mark it as visited.\\n6. Dequeue node 4, which is our target, and backtrack using the parent pointers to find the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's construct the path:\\n\\n- Node 4's parent is node 3.\\n- Node 3's parent is not specified in the steps above, but we continue to search through the parent pointers.\\n- Once we find node 3's parent, we continue this process until we reach the start node, node 2.\\n\\nAfter applying BFS and backtracking from the destination to the start node, we find that the shortest path from node 2 to node 4 is:\\n\\n2 -> 10 -> 4\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->10->4\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 11], [0, 10], [2, 10], [3, 13], [3, 4], [4, 10], [5, 9], [6, 14], [7, 11], [8, 13], [9, 12], [9, 14], [10, 12]]} The end node: 4 The start node: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node to the end node in the given graph, we will once again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

Node 10 is connected to nodes 2 and 12.
