BFS is a traversing algorithm for graphs that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path on an unweighted graph because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If it's the target node, we've found our shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue them with the current path extended by that node.\\n4. Once we reach the target node, the path leading to it will be the shortest.\\n\\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3.\\n\\nStarting from node 2, we will explore its neighbors, which are nodes 3 and 7.
