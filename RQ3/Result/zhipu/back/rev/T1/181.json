BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges between the start node and the target node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works in the context of this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially just the start node).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it. If it's the target node, the path to this node is the shortest path.\\n3. If the current node is not the target, enqueue all of its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited yet, along with the path to reach them.\\n4.
