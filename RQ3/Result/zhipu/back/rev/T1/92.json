BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, meaning it first explores all the neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nThe steps for BFS to find the shortest path are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with its path (initially, the path contains just the starting node).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the queue.\\n3. If this node is the destination node, the path to this node is the shortest path.\\n4. Otherwise, for each neighbor of this node, if the neighbor has not been visited yet, enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path.\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or the destination is reached.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 6:\\n\\n1. Start at node 3 and enqueue it with the path [3].\\n2. Dequeue node 3. Its neighbors are not yet visited, so enqueue each of them (nodes 6 and 12) with the updated path [3, 6] and [3, 12] respectively.\\n3.
