The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. It keeps track of the nodes that have been visited and the shortest path to each node. Here's a brief overview of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the starting node).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target, return the path to this node.\\n4. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited, enqueue the neighbor along with the path that led to it.\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or the target is found.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the provided graph, starting from node 11 and aiming to reach node 2.\\n\\nGiven the graph and the starting and destination nodes, the BFS algorithm would proceed as follows:\\n\\n- Start at node 11, and enqueue it with the path [11].\\n- Dequeue node 11, and explore its neighbors: 13 and 22.\\n- Enqueue these neighbors with the updated paths: [11->13] and [11->22].\\n- Continue this process, exploring all nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next.\\n- When node 2 is reached, the path to it is the shortest path from the starting node.\\n\\nSince I cannot directly execute code, I will describe the steps taken to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Node 11 is visited, and we look at its neighbors (13 and 22).\\n2. We visit node 22, which leads to nodes 12 and 5.\\n3. Node 5 leads to node 12 and node 22 (which we've already visited), so we continue with node 12.\\n4. Node 12 leads to nodes 18, 21, and 7. We continue exploring.\\n5.
