BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be visited next, and it ensures that the shortest path to each node is found because it explores all nodes at the present depth (and therefore all paths of the same length) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere are the steps involved in using BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. Add the starting node to the queue.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node and mark it as visited.\\n   b.

No other neighbors to enqueue.\\n- At this point, we have explored all nodes at the depth of 1 from the start node. We need to continue with the next level of nodes.\\n- Continue this process until we enqueue node 1, which is the target. At this point, we backtrack to find the shortest path.\\n\\nAfter applying BFS to the graph, we find that the shortest path from node 7 to node 1 is:\\n\\n7 -> 3 -> 12 -> 0 -> 11 -> 5 -> 1\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->3->12->0->11->5->1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 11], [1, 7], [2, 9], [2, 10], [2, 5], [3, 7], [3, 12], [5, 6], [5, 11], [5, 8], [8, 12]]} The end node: 1 The start node: 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node 7 to the end node 1 in the given graph, we will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, as it is well-suited for unweighted graphs like this one.
