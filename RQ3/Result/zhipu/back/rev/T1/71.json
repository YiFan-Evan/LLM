BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path because all nodes at the current level have the shortest distance from the starting node.\\n\\nThe steps for BFS are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with its path (initially just the start node itself).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node and its path.\\n   b. If this node is the target, return the path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each neighbor of this node that has not been visited, enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path.\\n3. If the queue is empty and the target has not been found, there is no path between the start and the target.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph:\\n\\n- Starting node: 2\\n- Target node: 6\\n\\nHere's the BFS process for the given graph:\\n\\n1. Enqueue node 2 with path [2].\\n2. Dequeue node 2, explore its neighbors (4), and enqueue node 4 with path [2, 4].\\n3. Dequeue node 4, explore its neighbors (5), and enqueue node 5 with path [2, 4, 5].\\n4. Dequeue node 5, which has no unvisited neighbors.\\n5. Dequeue node 3 (from the edge [1, 3] where node 1 was visited first), explore its neighbors (7), and enqueue node 7 with path [1, 3, 7].\\n6. Dequeue node 7, explore its neighbors (0 and 6), and enqueue node 0 and node 6 with paths [1, 3, 7, 0] and [1, 3, 7, 6], respectively.\\n7. Dequeue node 6, which is the target. Return the path [1, 3, 7, 6].\\n\\nHowever, there seems to be a mistake in the BFS process I described. The path [1, 3, 7, 6] is not the shortest path from node 2 to node 6. Let's correct the process:\\n\\n1. Start at node 2 and enqueue it with the path [2].\\n2. Dequeue node 2 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (4) with the path [2, 4].\\n3. Dequeue node 4 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (5) with the path [2, 4, 5].\\n4. Dequeue node 5 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (none).\\n5. Dequeue node 7 (from the edge [0, 7] where node 0 was visited first), and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (6) with the path [0, 7, 6].\\n6. Dequeue node 6, which is the target.

Let's solve the problem correctly using the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 6.\\n\\nFirst, we'll represent the graph as an adjacency list, which will allow us to easily traverse the neighbors of each node.\\n\\nThe graph's adjacency list representation based on the given edges is:\\n```\\n0: [7],\\n1: [5, 3],\\n2: [4],\\n3: [7],\\n4: [5],\\n5: [],\\n6: [7],\\n7: [0, 3, 6]\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's apply the BFS algorithm:\\n\\n1.
