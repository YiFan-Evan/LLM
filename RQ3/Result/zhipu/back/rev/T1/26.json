BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges from the source node to all other nodes. Here's a brief overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Start from the source node and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of the dequeued node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record the node from which it was reached (this will help reconstruct the path), and enqueue it.\\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or the destination is reached.\\n5. To reconstruct the path from the destination back to the source, backtrack from the destination node using the recorded information until you reach the source node.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n\\n```\\nnodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\nedges: [[0, 6], [0, 2], [1, 5], [2, 7], [3, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]]\\n```\\n\\nAnd the start node (6) and destination (0), let's apply BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Enqueue the start node (6).\\n2. Dequeue 6, mark it as visited, and enqueue its neighbors (0, 2).\\n3. Dequeue 0 (destination reached). Now we need to reconstruct the path.\\n\\nTo reconstruct the path, we need to have a way to track the path from the destination back to the source. Since we don't have the actual graph representation where we can store this information, I'll describe the process conceptually. We would have a \\\"parent\\\" or \\\"previous\\\" array to keep track of which node each node was visited from. Starting from the destination node (0), we would look up the previous node in our tracking array until we reach the source node (6).\\n\\nSince I don't have the ability to execute code or maintain state, I'll describe the shortest path based on the graph's structure:\\n\\n- Starting from 6, we can go directly to 0, so the shortest path is simply 6->0.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->0\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 2], [1, 5], [2, 7], [3, 7], [4, 5], [4, 6]]} The end node: 0 The start node: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"As previously explained, to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
