BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path because we have explored all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set to keep track of nodes to explore and nodes that have been visited.\\n2. Enqueue the starting node and mark it as visited.\\n3.

Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited, mark them as visited and enqueue them, keeping track of the node that got us to the current node (this is usually done with a parent or predecessor dictionary).\\n4.

From node 3, we explore its neighbors (0, 1, 4, and 5), but we skip 1 and 7 because they have been visited. From node 7, we explore its neighbor (1), but we skip it because it has been visited. Then, from node 5, we explore its neighbors (2 and 6). We reach node 2 from node 5, and since it's our target, we stop.\\n\\nNow we backtrack to find the shortest path:\\n\\n- We reached node 2 from node 5.\\n- We reached node 5 from node 3.\\n- We reached node 3 from node 1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->3->5->2\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [5, 6]]} The end node: 2 The start node: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The graph provided is the same as before, and the start and end nodes have been specified as 1 and 2, respectively.
