BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node from the starting node. Here's a brief explanation of the algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with its path (initially, the path contains just the starting node).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node and its path.\\n   b. If the dequeued node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of the dequeued node's neighbors, if it hasn't been visited yet, enqueue it with the updated path that includes this neighbor.\\n3. Mark each visited node to avoid revisiting it.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 1.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\n- Edges: (0-6), (0-3), (1-4), (1-2), (1-3), (2-5), (3-7)\\n\\nWe start at node 6 and look for the shortest path to node 1.\\n\\nStarting at node 6, we have the following path:\\n- 6\\n\\nNode 6 is connected to node 0, so we explore node 0 next:\\n- 6->0\\n\\nNode 0 is connected to nodes 3 and 6, but we have already visited node 6, so we move to node 3:\\n- 6->0->3\\n\\nNode 3 is connected to nodes 0, 7, and 1.
