The BFS algorithm explores the graph level by level, beginning at a starting node. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to explore and maintains a set or dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parents to reconstruct the path later.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works for this scenario:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a dictionary to track visited nodes and their parents. This will help in reconstructing the path once we reach the destination.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node and check if it is the destination. If it is, we've found the shortest path.\\n   b. If it's not the destination, iterate over its neighbors.\\n   c. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n4. Once we reach the destination, backtrack from the destination node to the starting node using the parent information to reconstruct the path.\\n5.
