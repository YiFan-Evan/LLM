The fundamental principle behind BFS is that it explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point). BFS uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored and maintains a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of BFS applied to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Create a dictionary to track the visited nodes and the shortest path to each node. Initialize the starting node with a path that includes only the starting node itself.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and explore all of its neighbors.\\n4. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited (or if we find a shorter path to it than previously known), update the shortest path to this neighbor and add it to the queue.\\n5. Repeat until the target node is dequeued from the queue or the queue is empty.\\n6. Once we reach the target node, we can reconstruct the shortest path by following the paths stored in the dictionary.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 6 and the destination node 13.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\\n- Edges: [[0, 3], [0, 11], [1, 10], [2, 10], [4, 7], [4, 12], [5, 8], [5, 9], [5, 12], [6, 11], [6, 14], [7, 10], [11, 12], [12, 13]]\\n\\nStarting at node 6, we would follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Enqueue node 6 and set its path to [6].\\n2. Dequeue node 6 and explore neighbors 11 and 14.\\n3. Enqueue node 11 with path [6, 11] and node 14 with path [6, 14].\\n4. Dequeue node 11 and explore its neighbors. We find node 12, so we enqueue it with path [6, 11, 12].\\n5. Dequeue node 14 and explore its neighbors (none lead to the destination any quicker).\\n6. Dequeue node 12 and explore its neighbor 13.
