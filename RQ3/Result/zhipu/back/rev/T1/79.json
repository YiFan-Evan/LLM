BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path from the starting node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (parent pointers).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n3. For each neighbor of this node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record the node that led to it (parent), and enqueue it.\\n4.
