BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (in this case, the starting node), and explores all its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic makes BFS suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it guarantees that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path to it.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of the BFS algorithm applied to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set or a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and the parent of each node.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n    c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited, mark them as visited, set their parent to the current node, and enqueue them.\\n4.
