The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting point, and it keeps track of the shortest distance from the start to each vertex.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given graph and find the shortest path from node 9 to node 1.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14\\n- Edges: [(0, 4), (1, 12), (2, 4), (2, 9), (3, 12), (3, 7), (3, 5), (5, 14), (6, 10), (6, 9), (7, 8), (7, 13), (9, 14), (11, 12)]\\n\\nStarting at node 9, we'll follow the algorithm to find the shortest path to node 1. \\n\\nAfter running Dijkstra's algorithm, we find that the shortest path from node 9 to node 1 is through nodes 6 and 12.

Let's solve the problem correctly this time.\\n\\nTo find the shortest path from the start node 9 to the end node 1 in the given graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm or a similar shortest path algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS), which is well-suited for unweighted graphs or graphs with uniform edge weights. Since the graph does not specify the weights of the edges, we will assume that all edges have the same weight (e.g., 1), making BFS a suitable choice.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS works for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph:\\n\\n1.
