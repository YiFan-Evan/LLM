We start at the given starting node (source).\\n2. We enqueue the starting node and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\\n4. For each unvisited neighbor, we mark it as visited, record the node that led us to it (so we can reconstruct the path later), and enqueue it.\\n5. We repeat this process until we find the target node or the queue is empty.\\n\\nOnce we reach the target node, we can backtrack through the recorded nodes that led to each other to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 6:\\n\\n1.
