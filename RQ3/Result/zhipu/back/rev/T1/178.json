BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node from the starting node. This is because the shortest path in an unweighted graph is the path with the fewest edges.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works in this context:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we stop and reconstruct the path from the starting node to the target node using a parent map (which keeps track of each node's parent).\\n   c. Otherwise, for each neighbor of this node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n3. Once we reach the target node, we backtrack through the parent map to reconstruct the path.\\n\\nFor the given graph, let's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 4:\\n\\n1. Start from node 6, and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue node 6 and explore its neighbors (21, 21, and 21, since there are multiple edges to the same node). Enqueue node 21.\\n3.
