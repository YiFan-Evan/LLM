The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to explore, and it also maintains a set of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant work.\\n\\nHere are the steps of the BFS algorithm applied to our problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (parent pointers).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the queue and check if it is the target node. If it is, we've found our shortest path.\\n3. If it's not the target node, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors and record the current node as the parent of these neighbors.\\n4. Mark the node as visited once it's dequeued.\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n\\nOnce the target node is found, we can backtrack through the parent pointers to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph with start node 11 and destination node 13:\\n\\n1. Start with node 11 in the queue.\\n2. Explore node 11, mark it as visited, and enqueue its neighbors: 0 and 7.\\n3.
