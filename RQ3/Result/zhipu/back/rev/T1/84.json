Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (also known as the predecessor of each node).\\n2. Pop a node from the queue and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited yet, mark it as visited, record its predecessor, and enqueue it.\\n4. If we reach the target node, we can backtrack from the target node to the start node using the predecessor information to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n5.
