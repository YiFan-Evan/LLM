BFS is a traversal algorithm for graphs that explores vertices in layers, starting from a specified source node. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, the path to that node is the shortest.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of the BFS algorithm applied to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add the start node to the queue and mark it as visited.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b.
