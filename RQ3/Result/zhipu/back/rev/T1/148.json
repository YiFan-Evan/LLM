BFS is effective for this purpose because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has done so using the shortest path.\\n\\nThe steps of the BFS algorithm are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with its path (initially, the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. If it is the target node, the path leading to it is the shortest path.\\n4. If not, enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors along with the new path (the current path plus the neighbor).\\n5. Mark the node as visited to avoid processing it multiple times.\\n6.

Start from node 2, enqueue it with path [2].\\n2. Dequeue node 2, it has one edge to node 4. Enqueue node 4 with path [2, 4].\\n3. Dequeue node 4, it has one edge to node 5.
