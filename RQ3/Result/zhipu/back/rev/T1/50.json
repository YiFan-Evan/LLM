BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we visit all the neighbors of a node before moving on to nodes that are further away. This characteristic of BFS makes it ideal for finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges between the start and target nodes.\\n\\nHere's how the BFS algorithm works in this context:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path leading to it (initially just the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the first element (node and path) from the queue.\\n3. If the current node is the target node, we have found our shortest path.\\n4. If not, for each of the current node's neighbors that have not been visited yet, enqueue them along with the updated path.\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 1 and the destination node 6:\\n\\n- Start by enqueueing node 1 with the path [1].\\n- Dequeue node 1, it has neighbors 7 and 0. Enqueue both with the updated paths [1->7] and [1->0].\\n- Dequeue node 7, it has already been visited (from node 1), so we skip it. Continue with node 0, which has neighbors 2 and the start node 1. Skip node 1 since it's the start node and has already been visited. Enqueue node 2 with the updated path [1->0->2].\\n- Continue this process. When node 2 is dequeued, it has no direct path to node 6, but node 2's neighbor node 0 has been visited, so we move on.\\n- When we visit node 5, we see that it has a direct connection to node 6. We can enqueue node 6 with the path [1->0->2->5->6].\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->0->2->5->6.
