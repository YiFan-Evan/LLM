BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has done so by taking the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works in the context of finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially just the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the first node in the queue and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of this node, if the neighbor has not been visited yet, mark it as visited, and enqueue it along with the updated path to reach it.\\n4. Repeat this process until the target node is dequeued from the queue, at which point the path leading to it is the shortest path.\\n5.
