BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it always explores the nearest nodes first before moving on to nodes that are further away.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set or dictionary to track visited nodes and their parents (or the path taken to reach them).\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, reconstruct the path from the start to the target by following the parent pointers.\\n   c.

Node 4 has no direct connection to node 3, but node 3 has direct connections to nodes 5, 6, and 7. We continue exploring.\\n- Continue this process until we enqueue node 3. Since node 3 is the target, we stop and reconstruct the path.\\n\\nReconstructing the path from node 3, we see that node 3 has no parent, but we know it was reached from node 5 or node 6 (since those are the only nodes connected to node 3 that we've visited). We must backtrack to find the correct path.\\n\\nLooking at the nodes that led to node 3, we see that node 5 is not connected to node 2, but node 6 is connected to node 0, which is connected to node 2. So the path from node 2 to node 3 is not direct. However, we missed the fact that node 3 is directly connected to node 5, and node 5 is connected to node 2.
