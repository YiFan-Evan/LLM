The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex. It keeps a set of unvisited vertices and calculates tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths. Once a vertex's shortest distance is finalized, it is moved to the set of visited vertices.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given graph, with the start node as 1 and the destination as 3.\\n\\nStarting with node 1, we have the following tentative distances:\\n- Node 1: 0 (starting point)\\n- Node 0: \u221e\\n- Node 2: \u221e\\n- Node 3: \u221e\\n- Node 4: \u221e\\n- Node 5: \u221e\\n- Node 6: \u221e\\n- Node 7: \u221e\\n\\nNode 1 is connected to nodes 6 and 7 with edges. Let's calculate the tentative distances:\\n- Node 6: 1 (1 -> 6)\\n- Node 7: 1 (1 -> 7)\\n\\nNow we choose the node with the smallest tentative distance, which is either 6 or 7. Let's choose node 6:\\n- Node 6 is connected to node 7 with an edge, but we have a direct edge from node 1 to node 7 with a smaller tentative distance, so we do not update the distance to node 7 through node 6.\\n\\nNext, we choose node 7:\\n- Node 7 is connected to nodes 2 and 4. Let's update their tentative distances.\\n- Node 2: min(\u221e, 1 + edge_length) = 2 (1 -> 7 -> 2)\\n- Node 4: min(\u221e, 1 + edge_length) = 2 (1 -> 7 -> 4)\\n\\nNow we choose node 2:\\n- Node 2 is connected to node 3 with an edge.
