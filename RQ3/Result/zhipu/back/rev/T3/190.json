BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores nodes in layers, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node as soon as we reach it. The algorithm works by starting at the source node and exploring all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If it is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each neighbor of this node that has not been visited, mark it as visited, enqueue it, and record the node from which it was reached.\\n4. Once the target node is dequeued, backtrack using the recorded nodes to find the path from the start to the target.\\n\\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 2.\\n\\n```\\n1.

However, I haven't actually implemented the BFS traversal above; I've just described the steps we would take.
