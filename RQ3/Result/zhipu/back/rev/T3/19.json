It seems like the destination node was not specified in your message. However, I will continue with the assumption that the destination node is node 5, as you had previously mentioned it.\\n\\nTo find the shortest path from node 3 to node 5 using the BFS algorithm, we will follow the steps outlined in the previous explanation.

Node 2 is not visited, so we enqueue it and record that it came from node 3. Node 5 is also not visited, so we enqueue it and record that it came from node 3.\\n4. Dequeue node 2, mark it as visited, and examine its neighbors. Node 3 is already visited, and node 5 is already visited, so we move on.\\n5. Dequeue node 5, mark it as visited, and examine its neighbors. Node 0 and node 6 are not visited, so we enqueue them and record their parent.\\n6. Since node 5 is the destination, we stop the BFS process.\\n\\nNow, to reconstruct the path from node 5 back to node 3, we follow the parent links:\\n\\n- Node 5's parent is node 3.\\n- Node 3 has no parent because it's the start node.\\n\\nTherefore, the shortest path from node 3 to node 5 is:\\n\\n3 -> 5\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->5\""}]
