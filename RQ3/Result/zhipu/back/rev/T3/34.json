BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, starting from the source node. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we stop and backtrack from the target to the start using the parent pointers to find the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes, if it has not been visited yet, mark it as visited, set its parent to the current node, and enqueue it.\\n3. Once we reach the target node, backtrack using the parent pointers to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 5 and the destination node 4:\\n\\n1. Start with node 5, enqueue it and set its parent to None.\\n2. Dequeue node 5, and explore its neighbors: 2 and 4. Node 4 is the target, so we stop here.\\n3.
