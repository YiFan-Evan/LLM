BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path from the starting node to the target.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and their parents.\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found the shortest path.\\n3. If it's not the target node, enqueue all of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet, and record their parent (the node from which we arrived at the current node).\\n4.

Start with node 13, and mark it as visited.\\n2. Enqueue its adjacent nodes: 14 (since 13-14 is an edge).\\n3. Dequeue node 14, mark it as visited.

Dequeue node 8, mark it as visited. No edges from 8 lead to the destination, so we continue.\\n6. Dequeue node 2, mark it as visited. Enqueue its adjacent nodes: 5 (since 2-5 is an edge) and 14 (which is already visited, so we skip it).\\n7. Dequeue node 5, mark it as visited. Enqueue its adjacent nodes: 11 (since 5-11 is an edge), 10 (since 5-10 is an edge), and 14 (which is already visited, so we skip it).\\n8.
