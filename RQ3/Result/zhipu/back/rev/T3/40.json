BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node from the starting node. It works by keeping a queue of nodes to explore, and for each node, it checks all of its neighbors. For each neighbor, if it has not been visited yet, it is added to the queue and its distance from the start is recorded.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set or a dictionary to record visited nodes and their distances from the start node.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, stop the search as we've found the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of the node's neighbors that haven't been visited:\\n      i. Mark the neighbor as visited.\\n      ii. Record the distance from the start node to this neighbor.\\n      iii. Enqueue the neighbor.\\n4. Once the target node is reached, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the recorded distances to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n- Edges: [[0, 4], [0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 4], [5, 6]]\\n- Start node: 4\\n- Destination: 6\\n\\nUsing BFS:\\n\\n1. Start at node 4.\\n2. Explore neighbors 0 and 3 (distance 1).\\n3. Explore neighbors of 0 (distance 2) and 3 (distance 2), but only continue with unvisited nodes. Node 3 doesn't have any unvisited neighbors.\\n4. Explore the unvisited neighbors of node 0, which are none, and node 1, which leads to node 7 (distance 2).\\n5. Explore the unvisited neighbors of node 1 (none) and node 7 (none).\\n6. Explore the unvisited neighbors of node 2, which is node 5 (distance 2).\\n7. Explore the unvisited neighbor of node 5, which is node 6 (distance 3).\\n\\nWe've reached the target node 6 with a distance of 3 from the start node 4.
