The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time we visit a node, we have found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set to keep track of the nodes to be explored and the nodes that have been visited.\\n2. Add the starting node to the queue.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its unvisited neighbors, mark it as visited, record the node that led to its discovery (this will help us reconstruct the path later), and enqueue the neighbor.\\n4.
