Since the graph provided does not specify weights for the edges, we will assume that each edge has a weight of 1, making the problem a search for the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\\n\\nDijkstra's algorithm works by maintaining a set of unvisited nodes and calculating tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths. It selects the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, sets it as the new current node, and updates the tentative distances of its adjacent nodes.\\n\\nHere is how the algorithm would be applied to the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize the distances from the start node (0) to all other nodes as infinity (or a very large number), except for the start node itself, which is set to 0.\\n2.
