BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges from the source to the target. The algorithm maintains a queue of nodes to explore, and for each node, it explores all of its neighbors at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm applied to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node and its path from the queue.\\n   b. If the dequeued node is the target, return the path leading to it.\\n   c.

Explore neighbors of 6: There are edges to nodes 8 and 10.\\n   a. Enqueue node 8 with path [7, 6, 8] (overwriting the previous path to 8 since it's shorter).\\n   b. Enqueue node 10 with path [7, 6, 10].\\n7. Dequeue node 8 with path [7, 5, 8].\\n8. Explore neighbors of 8: There is an edge to node 5 (which is already in the path, so we ignore it) and an edge to node 2.\\n   a. Enqueue node 2 with path [7, 5, 8, 2].\\n9.
