Since the weights of the edges are not specified, we can assume that each edge has a weight of 1 for simplicity.\\n\\nThe algorithm works by maintaining a set of unvisited nodes and calculating tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths. Initially, the distance to the starting node is set to 0, and the distances to all other nodes are set to infinity. The algorithm proceeds by finding the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, updating the distances of its neighboring nodes, and marking the node as visited. This process continues until the destination node is visited, or all nodes have been visited.\\n\\nLet's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph:\\n\\n1.
