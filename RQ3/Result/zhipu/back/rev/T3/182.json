BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to be explored and is suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is done so via the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. Enqueue the starting node and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the target, we've found our shortest path.\\n    c.
