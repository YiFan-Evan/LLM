BFS is a traversing algorithm for graphs that explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path on an unweighted graph because it explores all nodes at the present \\\"depth\\\" (or distance from the start node) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path to each node (this will be our \\\"visited\\\" dictionary).\\n2. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the queue and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n4. For each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited, add it to the queue and record the path to it by appending the current node to the path that led to the current node.\\n5. Once we find the target node, we backtrack using the recorded paths to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 5 and the destination node 7.\\n\\n```\\n# Initialize the queue and visited dictionary\\nqueue = [(5, [5])]  # Each entry is a tuple (node, path)\\nvisited = {5: [5]}\\n\\n# Apply BFS\\nwhile queue:\\n    current_node, path = queue.pop(0)\\n    \\n    # Check if we have reached the destination\\n    if current_node == 7:\\n        break\\n    \\n    # Explore neighbors\\n    for edge in [[0, 2], [0, 7], [0, 12], [1, 9], [2, 3], [3, 6], [4, 12], [5, 11], [6, 9], [7, 8], [7, 11], [9, 10]]:\\n        neighbor = edge[1] if edge[0] == current_node else edge[0]\\n        if neighbor not in visited:\\n            visited[neighbor] = path + [neighbor]\\n            queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))\\n```\\n\\nOnce we find the target node (7) in the queue, we can construct the shortest path by looking at the path we recorded for it in the visited dictionary.\\n\\nThe path for node 7 in the visited dictionary will give us the shortest path from node 5 to node 7.\\n\\nLet's construct the path:\\n```\\n# Assuming we found the path in the visited dictionary\\nshortest_path = visited[7]\\n\\n# Format the path as required\\nformatted_path = '->'.join(map(str, shortest_path))\\n```\\n\\nNow, let's assume the BFS has been executed and we have found the shortest path.
