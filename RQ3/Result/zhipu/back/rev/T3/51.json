BFS is particularly suitable for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path.\\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, stop the search.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\\n   d. Also, keep track of the parent of each node so that we can reconstruct the path once the target node is reached.\\n4. Once the target node is found, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent pointers to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 5.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n- Edges: [[0, 3], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 5], [2, 3], [3, 4], [3, 6]]\\n\\nStarting at node 2, we will explore its neighbors, which are nodes 3 and 5.
