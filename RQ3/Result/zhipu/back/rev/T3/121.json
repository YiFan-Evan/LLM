BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path since all edges are considered to have the same weight (or cost).\\n\\nThe steps of BFS for finding the shortest path are:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node.\\n4. If it is the target, we have found the shortest path.\\n5. If it is not the target, add all unvisited neighboring nodes to the queue.\\n6. Keep track of the previous node for each visited node so that we can reconstruct the path once the target is found.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 4.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\\n- Edges: [[0, 1], [0, 11], [0, 10], [2, 10], [3, 13], [3, 4], [4, 10], [5, 9], [6, 14], [7, 11], [8, 13], [9, 12], [9, 14], [10, 12]]\\n\\nStarting at node 2, the BFS traversal would proceed as follows:\\n- Node 2 is visited and its neighbors (10) are added to the queue.\\n- Node 10 is visited, and its neighbors (2, 12) are added to the queue (ignoring 2 as it's already visited).\\n- Node 12 is visited and since 4 is not a neighbor of 12, we move on to the next unvisited node.\\n- We continue this process until we reach node 4, keeping track of the previous node that led us to each node.\\n\\nReconstructing the path from node 4 back to node 2, we would get the shortest path.\\n\\nSince I can't execute code, I'll describe the steps you would take to find the path programmatically:\\n\\n1. Start BFS from node 2.\\n2. Discover node 10 as the next node.\\n3. From node 10, you cannot go back to node 2, so you continue to explore other neighbors.\\n4. You will not find node 4 from node 10, so you continue BFS.\\n5.
