BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point). It keeps track of all the visited nodes and the distance from the start node to each visited node. The algorithm uses a queue to manage the nodes to be explored and a dictionary to store the parent of each node, which will help us reconstruct the path once we reach the target node.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Create a dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node to explore.\\n4. If the node is the target, stop the search.\\n5. Otherwise, for each of the node's neighbors, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n6. Once the target node is reached, backtrack using the parent dictionary to construct the path from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 23 and the destination node 19.\\n\\n1. Start with node 23 in the queue.\\n2. Explore the neighbors of node 23 and enqueue them if they haven't been visited yet.\\n3. Continue exploring nodes level by level until we reach node 19.\\n4.
