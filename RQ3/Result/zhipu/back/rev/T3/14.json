It seems I didn't complete the explanation before providing the answer. Let's continue with the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from node 1 to the destination node, which was not specified in your initial message. Since the destination node is missing, I'll assume you want to find the shortest path from node 1 to all other nodes.\\n\\nContinuing from where we left off:\\n\\n1. We enqueue the start node (1).\\n2. We dequeue node 1, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (3).\\n3. Next, we dequeue node 3. Node 3 is not the target, so we enqueue its unvisited neighbors. In this case, there are no unvisited neighbors for node 3 since it was reached directly from node 1 and there are no other edges connected to node 3 in the given graph.\\n4. We continue with the BFS process. Since node 3 has no unvisited neighbors, we move on to the next node in the queue, if there is any.\\n\\nTo find the shortest path to all nodes, we would continue this process until all nodes have been visited. However, since we are looking for the shortest path to a specific target node, we would stop as soon as we dequeue the target node. Since the target node was not specified, I will provide the shortest path from node 1 to all other nodes.\\n\\nLet's assume the target node is node 2 and continue with the BFS:\\n\\n1. Enqueue the start node (1).\\n2. Dequeue node 1, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (3).\\n3. Dequeue node 3, mark it as visited, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (2).\\n4. Dequeue node 2 (target reached), and reconstruct the path.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 2 is:\\n\\n1->3->2\\n\\nIf the destination node was different, we would have continued the BFS until we reached that specific node. Since I don't have the actual destination node, I'll provide the final answer based on the assumption that the destination is node 2:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->3->2\\n\\nIf you provide a specific destination node, I can give you the exact shortest path to that node.\""}]
