To find the shortest path from the start node to the destination, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is efficient for graphs with non-negative edge weights. Since the graph provided does not specify weights for the edges, we will assume each edge has a weight of 1 for simplicity.\\n\\nDijkstra's algorithm works by iteratively selecting the unvisited node with the smallest distance from the start, updating the distances of its adjacent nodes, and marking it as visited. It uses a priority queue to efficiently select the next node to visit. The algorithm continues until the destination node is reached or all nodes have been visited.\\n\\nLet's apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize distances with infinity for all nodes except the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Initialize a priority queue and insert the start node with a distance of 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, extract the node with the smallest distance.\\n4. If this node is the destination, we have found the shortest path.\\n5. Otherwise, for each unvisited neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through the current node. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and insert the neighbor into the priority queue.\\n6. Mark the node as visited once it's been processed.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the given graph and find the shortest path from node 12 to node 6:\\n\\n- Start at node 12 (distance to itself is 0).\\n- Node 12 has edges to nodes 0 and 11, so we update their distances to 1.\\n- Next, we visit node 0 (distance 1) and find no shorter paths to other nodes.\\n- Next, we visit node 11 (distance 1) and update distances to nodes 7 and 14 to 2.\\n- Next, we visit node 7 (distance 2) and update the distance to node 6 to 3 (since node 7 is connected to node 6).\\n- Now, we visit node 6 (distance 3) and since this is our destination, we stop.\\n\\nTo reconstruct the path, we can backtrack from the destination node to the start node by keeping track of the previous node that led to each node with the shortest path.\\n\\nBacktracking from node 6, we find that the previous node is node 7. The previous node for node 7 is node 11, and for node 11, it's node 12.
