It seems I stopped my explanation prematurely. Let's continue with the correct BFS approach and find the shortest path from node 2 to the destination node, which was not specified in your message.\\n\\nHowever, since you provided the start node (2) and the edges of the graph, I will assume you meant to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 7, as node 7 is the only node not directly connected to node 2 in the given edges and is a common endpoint in such problems.\\n\\nHere's the continuation of the BFS approach:\\n\\n1. We start with node 2 and enqueue it along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. We then dequeue node 2 and examine its neighbors, which are nodes 0, 5, and 6 according to the edges provided.\\n3. For each neighbor, we enqueue them if they haven't been visited yet, along with the updated path. We mark them as visited to avoid processing them multiple times.\\n4.
