Start from the initial node and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node, mark it as visited and enqueue it.

Dequeue 2 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: 5 and 10.\\n6. Dequeue 8 and enqueue its unvisited neighbor: 9.\\n7. Dequeue 9 and enqueue its unvisited neighbor: 11.\\n8.
