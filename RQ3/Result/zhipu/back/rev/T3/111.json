BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from a given source node, and keeps track of the shortest path to each node it visits. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to visit and a dictionary (or an array) to store the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level explanation of the BFS algorithm applied to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node.\\n2. Keep a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node, with the start node's path being just the start node itself.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node.\\n4. For each of the node's neighbors, if the shortest path to that neighbor hasn't been found yet (or if it's found but longer than the current path plus the neighbor), update the shortest path and enqueue the neighbor.\\n5. Repeat until the target node is dequeued from the queue, at which point the shortest path to the target has been found.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 11:\\n\\n1. Start at node 3, and enqueue it.\\n2. The shortest path to node 3 is just [3].\\n3. Dequeue node 3 and examine its neighbors (nodes 2 and 5).\\n4. Update the shortest path to nodes 2 and 5 to be [3, 2] and [3, 5], respectively.\\n5. Enqueue nodes 2 and 5.\\n6. Continue this process until node 11 is reached.\\n\\nAfter running BFS on the graph, we find that the shortest path from node 3 to node 11 is through node 2, then node 0, and finally node 11.

The BFS algorithm is appropriate here because it ensures that we explore all nodes at the present \\\"depth\\\" (or distance from the start node) before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This guarantees that the first time we reach the destination node, we have found the shortest path to it.\\n\\nHere's how we would apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 0:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (3).\\n2.
