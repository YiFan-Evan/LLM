The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is visited, the shortest path to that node is found.\\n\\nHere are the steps involved in using BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Keep a dictionary to track the path by storing the parent of each node visited.\\n4. Dequeue a node from the queue and for each of its adjacent nodes, if the node has not been visited, mark it as visited, record its parent, and enqueue it.\\n5. If the target node is dequeued, the shortest path is found.\\n6.
