The algorithm works by repeatedly picking the vertex with the minimal distance from the start point that has not been included in the path yet, and calculating the distance through it to each of its neighbors.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\\n\\n1. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for the initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n2. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited.\\n5. After all nodes have been visited, the shortest path from the start node to the target node can be reconstructed by following the nodes with the smallest tentative distance from the start node.\\n\\nNow let's apply this to the given graph, starting at node 4 and aiming to reach node 12.\\n\\nGiven the graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\\n- Edges: [[0, 7], [0, 14], [1, 11], [1, 13], [1, 14], [2, 12], [2, 4], [3, 5], [3, 9], [3, 13], [4, 9], [6, 10], [8, 13], [10, 14]]\\n\\nStarting at node 4, we would follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Node 4 has edges to nodes 9 and 2.\\n2. We visit node 2 because it has the shortest edge weight (which is implicitly 1 since edge weights are not given, we assume they are all 1 for an unweighted graph).\\n3. From node 2, we can go to nodes 4 and 12.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path leading to it (initially just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the first node in the queue and examine its neighbors.\\n3.
