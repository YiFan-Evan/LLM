BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we first reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for our purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored.\\n2. Start from the given starting node, add it to the queue, and mark it as visited.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node from the queue.\\n   b. Check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found our shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes that haven't been visited, mark them as visited, record the node that led to their discovery (this will help us reconstruct the path later), and enqueue them.\\n4. Once we reach the target node, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the recorded information to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 1:\\n\\n1. Start at node 8, mark it as visited, and enqueue it.\\n2. Visit node 6 (from node 8), mark it as visited, record that we got to node 6 from node 8, and enqueue node 6.\\n3. Visit node 11 (from node 6), mark it as visited, record that we got to node 11 from node 6, and enqueue node 11.\\n4. Visit node 1 (from node 11), mark it as visited, record that we got to node 1 from node 11, and since it's the target node, we stop.\\n\\nTo reconstruct the path:\\n- We start at node 1 and look at the recorded information to find that we got to node 1 from node 11.\\n- Then we look at node 11's recorded information to find that we got to node 11 from node 6.\\n- Finally, we look at node 6's recorded information to find that we got to node 6 from node 8.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->6->11->1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 4], [1, 4], [1, 11], [2, 10], [3, 7], [3, 12], [5, 7], [6, 8], [6, 11], [7, 11], [10, 12]]} The start node: 8 The destination: 11"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from node 8 to node 11 in the given graph, we will once again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.
