BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of the BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node (also known as the parent of each node).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue the next node and examine it.\\n    b. If this node is the target, we can reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target node to the start node using the parent dictionary.\\n    c.
