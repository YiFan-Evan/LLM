BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we first reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node. BFS uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to explore, and it also maintains an array or dictionary to store the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS works to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node. Initialize it with the start node having no previous node (or a special marker).\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, reconstruct the path from the start node to the target node using the dictionary, and return it.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it, and record the current node as its previous node in the dictionary.\\n4. If the target node is not found, return that there is no path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the given graph and find the shortest path from node 7 to node 12.\\n\\nStarting at node 7, we will explore its neighbors (nodes 3 and 6). We'll choose node 3 to explore first (the order in which we explore neighbors doesn't matter for unweighted graphs, as all paths are of equal length). From node 3, we go to node 7, and from node 6, we also go to node 7. Since we've reached node 7, which is our target, we stop and reconstruct the path.\\n\\nThe path from node 7 to node 12 is: 7->3. Since node 3 doesn't directly connect to node 12, we must have missed the shortest path by not exploring node 6's other neighbors first. Let's correct that oversight.\\n\\nFrom node 6, we also have to explore node 5 and node 13. From node 5, we go to nodes 12 and 6.
