BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the shortest path to any node is found before moving to nodes that are further away. This property makes BFS suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works in the context of finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node).\\n2.

We start at the given start node (node 6 in this case) and enqueue it along with the path taken to reach it (which initially is just the start node itself).\\n2.

We have not found node 1 yet. When we explore the neighbors of node 4 (which is node 3), we do not find node 1 either.
