BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to be explored and is well-suited for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS to find the shortest path from the start node to the destination:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the queue and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the destination, then we have found the shortest path.\\n4.
