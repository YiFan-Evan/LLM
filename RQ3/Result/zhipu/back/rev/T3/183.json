The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex. It keeps a set of unvisited vertices and calculates tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths.\\n\\nHere's how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\\n\\n1. Mark the starting vertex as visited and set its distance to 0.\\n2. Set the initial distances to all other vertices to infinity.\\n3. While there are unvisited vertices:\\n   a. Select the unvisited vertex with the smallest tentative distance.\\n   b. For each neighbor of this vertex, calculate the distance through the current vertex. If this distance is shorter than the previously recorded distance, update the distance.\\n   c. Mark the current vertex as visited.\\n4. Once the destination vertex is visited, the shortest path to it is found.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph with the start node 11 and the destination node 2:\\n\\n1.
