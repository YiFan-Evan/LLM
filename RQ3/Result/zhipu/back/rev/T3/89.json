BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting point). It is particularly useful for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nThe steps for BFS are as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the starting node).\\n2. Dequeue the first element of the queue. If this node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n3. If it is not the target, for each of its adjacent nodes, if the node has not been visited yet, enqueue it along with the path taken to reach it.\\n4. Repeat the process until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 8:\\n\\n1. Start from node 6 and enqueue it with the path [6].\\n2. Dequeue node 6. It's not the target, so look at its neighbors: there are no direct edges from 6 to 8, but there is an edge to node 11.\\n3. Enqueue node 11 with the path [6, 11].\\n4. Dequeue node 11. It's not the target, so look at its neighbors. There are no direct edges from 11 to 8, but we can go back to node 6, which we have already visited, so we skip it.\\n5. Now, go back to the queue. The next node to dequeue is node 4, which can be reached from node 4->6 or node 3->4. Since we have already visited node 6, we continue with node 3.\\n6. Enqueue node 3 with the path [6, 11, 3].\\n7. Dequeue node 3. Now we can reach node 8 directly from node 3.\\n8. Enqueue node 8 with the path [6, 11, 3, 8].\\n9. Dequeue node 8.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node 6 along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just [6]).\\n2. Dequeue node 6. It's not the destination, so explore its neighbors.\\n3.

There are no direct edges from 11 to 3, but we can go back to node 6, which we have already visited, so we skip it and move to the next node in the queue.\\n5. Dequeue node 4. It's not the destination either, but it has edges to nodes 6 (which we've visited already) and 12. We enqueue node 12 with the path [6, 4, 12].\\n6. Dequeue node 12.

At this point, we go back to the queue. There are no more nodes to visit from the paths we have, so we have not found the destination node 3 yet.\\n8. We must have missed something, as node 3 should be reachable from node 4. Let's check the edges again: from node 4, we can go to node 6 (visited), node 12 (visited), and node 3 (which is the destination).\\n9. We enqueue node 3 with the path [6, 4, 3].\\n10.
