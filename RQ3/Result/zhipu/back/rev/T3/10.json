It seems there was a mistake in my previous response. I incorrectly stated that the destination was 0, but you did not specify the destination in your initial message. Let's correct that and find the shortest path from node 1 to the correct destination node.\\n\\nSince the destination node was not specified, I'll provide a general approach to finding the shortest path to any destination node using the BFS algorithm. However, I will need to know the destination node to provide the actual path. For the sake of demonstration, let's assume the destination node is node 3.\\n\\nHere's how we would apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 1 to node 3:\\n\\n1.

To reconstruct the path, we would keep track of the parent of each node as we enqueue its neighbors.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 6], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 6]]}\\nStart node: 1\\nDestination node: 3 (assumed for this example)\\n\\nStarting BFS from node 1, we would explore its neighbors (0 and 6). Node 0 is not on the path to node 3, but node 6 is connected to node 3. Thus, we would continue from node 6 to node 3.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 1 to node 3 would be: 1 -> 6 -> 3\\n\\nHowever, without knowing the actual destination node, I cannot provide the exact path. If you provide the destination node, I can give you the correct shortest path. Here's how the final answer would look with the assumed destination node 3:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->6->3\\n\\nPlease provide the actual destination node to get the correct shortest path.\""}]
