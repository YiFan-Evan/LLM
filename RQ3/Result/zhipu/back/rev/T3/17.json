BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we visit a node for the first time, we have found the shortest path to that node from the starting point. BFS uses a queue to keep track of the next node to explore, and it also keeps track of the nodes that have already been visited to avoid cycles.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially just the start node).\\n2. Dequeue the first element of the queue. This is the current node we are exploring.\\n3. If the current node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n4.
