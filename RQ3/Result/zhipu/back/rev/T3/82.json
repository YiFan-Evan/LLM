The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path to it.\\n\\nHere are the steps for BFS to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Keep a dictionary to store the parent of each node. This will help reconstruct the path once the target is reached.\\n4. Dequeue a node from the queue and for each of its adjacent nodes, if the node has not been visited, mark it as visited, enqueue it, and record its parent.\\n5. If the target node is dequeued, reconstruct the path by backtracking through the parent dictionary.\\n6.
