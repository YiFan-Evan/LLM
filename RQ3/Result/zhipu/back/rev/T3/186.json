Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex, until it reaches the target vertex.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\\n\\n1. Mark the starting node with a distance of 0 and all other nodes with a distance of infinity.\\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\\n3. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one.\\n4. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited.\\n5. Select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 3.\\n6. The process is repeated until the target node is visited or all nodes are visited.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph with the start node 19 and the destination node 22.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process for the given graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize distances and previous nodes.\\n2. Set the distance to the start node (19) to 0, and all others to infinity.\\n3. The node with the smallest distance (19) is the current node.\\n4. Update the distances to the neighbors of 19: there's no direct edge to 22, so we consider the edges to other nodes.\\n5. Move to the neighbor with the smallest tentative distance that hasn't been visited yet.\\n6. Repeat the process, updating distances and selecting the next node with the smallest tentative distance.\\n\\nAfter performing these steps, we find that the shortest path from node 19 to node 22 is 19->8->20->24 (since there is no direct edge from 19 to 22, we have to go through node 8, then node 20, and finally node 24, which is connected to node 22).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 19->8->20->24->22.

Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node which is set to 0.\\n2. Create a set or a list to keep track of visited nodes.\\n3. While the destination node has not been visited:\\n   a. Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance from the start.\\n   b. Mark this node as visited.\\n   c. For each neighbor of this node, if the path through the current node offers a shorter path than previously known, update the shortest path.\\n4. Once the destination node is visited, or all nodes have been visited, the shortest path to the destination node is found.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the graph:\\n\\n1. Start at node 19 with a distance of 0.\\n2. Node 19 has direct edges to nodes 2 and 5. Update their distances if a shorter path is found.\\n3. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest distance, which could be node 2 or node 5, depending on the graph structure.\\n4.
