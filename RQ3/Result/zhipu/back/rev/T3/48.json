BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores nodes in layers, ensuring that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node from the starting point.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n    c.

Enqueue node 5 with path [5].\\n2. Dequeue node 5, mark it as visited. Node 5 has no direct connection to node 4, so we enqueue its unvisited neighbors (none in this case).\\n3. Since node 5 has no direct neighbors leading to node 4, we need to backtrack. However, based on the given edges, node 5 is not directly connected to any other nodes except node 0. So, we would enqueue node 0 with path [5, 0].\\n4. Dequeue node 0, mark it as visited. Node 0 is connected to node 1, which is not the target, so we enqueue node 1 with path [5, 0, 1].\\n5. Dequeue node 1, mark it as visited. Node 1 is connected to nodes 4, 6, and 7.
