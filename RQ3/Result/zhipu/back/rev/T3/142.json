BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed. The algorithm maintains a queue of nodes to be explored and keeps track of the paths leading to each node. When a node is dequeued, it is checked to see if it is the target node. If it is not, the algorithm explores all its neighbors and enqueues them if they have not been visited yet, keeping track of the path that led to each neighbor.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path to it (which is just the start node itself at this point).\\n2. Dequeue the first node from the queue and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target node, the path to this node is the shortest path.\\n4. If the node is not the target, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors along with the path to each neighbor.\\n5.
