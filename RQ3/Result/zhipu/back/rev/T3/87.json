BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, ensuring that the shortest path in an unweighted graph is found. The algorithm works by starting at the source node and exploring all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially just the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node and its path from the queue.\\n3. If the dequeued node is the target node, the path is the shortest path.\\n4. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node, if the neighbor has not been visited, enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path.\\n5.
