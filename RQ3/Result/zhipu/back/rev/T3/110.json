BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (in this case, the starting point). It keeps track of all the nodes that have been visited and the distance from the start node to each visited node. It also maintains a queue of next nodes to visit and a predecessor map to reconstruct the path once the target node is reached.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Create a dictionary to keep track of the distance from the start node to each visited node, with the start node having a distance of 0.\\n3. Create a dictionary to keep track of the predecessor of each visited node to reconstruct the path later.\\n4. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node to visit.\\n   b.
