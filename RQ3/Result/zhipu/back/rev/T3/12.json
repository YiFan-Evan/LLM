BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node from the starting node because it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's how the BFS algorithm works in the context of finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with its path (initially, just the starting node).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and examine it.\\n3. If this node is the destination node, we have found the shortest path.\\n4. If not, for each of its adjacent nodes, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it with the updated path (the path to the current node plus the current node).\\n5.
