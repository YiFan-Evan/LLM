The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time it visits the target node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of the BFS algorithm:\\n\\n1. Start from the initial node and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of the dequeued node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Also, keep track of the parent of each node so that we can reconstruct the path once we reach the target node.\\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the target node is dequeued or the queue is empty.\\n5. Once the target node is found, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent pointers to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph, starting at node 5 and aiming to reach node 6.\\n\\n1.

Now we backtrack to find the shortest path.\\n\\nBacktracking from node 6 to node 5 (since node 6 has no parent in our BFS tree, we know it's directly connected to node 5), we get the path: 5 -> 3 -> 6.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->3->6\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 5], [1, 2], [1, 5], [3, 6], [4, 5], [5, 7]]} The start node: 5 The destination: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve this problem, we will again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, as it is effective for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
