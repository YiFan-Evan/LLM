Since the graph is unweighted (the distances between nodes are not provided, and we can assume they are all the same), BFS is a suitable choice. BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for our case:\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. Dequeue a node and mark it as visited.\\n3. For each adjacent node that has not been visited, enqueue it and record the path taken to reach it.\\n4.

Start at node 2, mark it as visited, and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue node 2 and explore its neighbors: nodes 0, 4, and 6.\\n3. Node 3 is not a direct neighbor of node 2, so we continue by enqueueing the unvisited neighbors of node 2 that haven't been enqueued yet, which are nodes 0 and 4.\\n4. Next, we dequeue node 0 (which has already been marked as visited) and explore its neighbors. Node 2 is already visited, so we only enqueue node 4 if it hasn't been visited yet.\\n5. We then dequeue node 4. Node 2 is already visited, but node 3 is a neighbor of node 4 and has not been visited yet, so we mark node 3 as visited and enqueue it if necessary.\\n\\nSince we've reached node 3 directly from node 4, we have found our shortest path without needing to explore further.
