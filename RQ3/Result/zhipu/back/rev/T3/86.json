Initialize a queue to keep track of the nodes to be visited next.\\n2. Keep a set or a list to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Start from the given starting node, mark it as visited, and enqueue it.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and examine its neighbors.\\n5. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited, record the node that led to its discovery (this helps reconstruct the path later), and enqueue it.\\n6.
