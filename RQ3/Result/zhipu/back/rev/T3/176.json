Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c.
