However, since we are only interested in finding the shortest path from the starting point to the target point, we can adapt the algorithm to stop once the target is reached.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind Dijkstra's algorithm is to maintain a priority queue of nodes, where the priority is the distance from the start node. Initially, the distance to the start node is 0, and the distance to all other nodes is set to infinity. We then explore the node with the smallest distance, and update the distances to its neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.\\n\\nHere are the steps involved:\\n\\n1. Initialize distances with infinity for all nodes except the start node, which is set to 0.\\n2. Initialize a priority queue and insert the start node with distance 0.\\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\\n   a. Extract the node with the minimum distance.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, we stop and backtrack to find the shortest path.\\n   c. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance through this node. If this distance is shorter than the previously known distance, update the distance and insert the neighbor into the priority queue.\\n4. Once the target node is reached, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent pointers to reconstruct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow let's apply this to the given graph:\\n\\nGraph nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\\nGraph edges: [[0, 1], [0, 8], [0, 7], [2, 7], [2, 14], [3, 10], [4, 7], [5, 9], [6, 11], [6, 7], [7, 12], [8, 10], [9, 10], [12, 13]]\\nStart node: 9\\nDestination: 2\\n\\nSince the explanation of the algorithm is quite detailed and implementing it here would be too verbose, I'll summarize the steps and provide the answer.\\n\\n1. Initialize distances and priority queue.\\n2. Begin with the start node (9) and explore its neighbors (10).\\n3. Move to node 10 and explore its neighbors (8, 9).\\n4.

Move to node 2, which is the target node, and stop.\\n\\nNow we backtrack to find the shortest path:\\n\\n2 was reached from 7, 7 was reached from 0, and 0 was reached from 8.

Initialize the distance to the start node (9) to 0 and to all other nodes to infinity.\\n2. Set the start node as the current node and mark it as visited.\\n3.
