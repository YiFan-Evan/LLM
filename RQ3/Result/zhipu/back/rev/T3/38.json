BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path (in terms of the number of edges) possible.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works in the context of finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the starting node itself).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a.
