BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node from the starting node. When we reach the target node, we can reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target node to the start node using the parent pointers that were recorded during the BFS traversal.\\n\\nHere's a high-level explanation of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a record of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we stop and reconstruct the path.\\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes of the current node and mark them as visited.\\n4. To reconstruct the path, we backtrack from the target node using a parent map that records which node led to the current node.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 10 and the destination node 6.\\n\\n```\\nBFS starting at node 10:\\n\\nQueue: [10]\\nVisited: {10}\\nParent: {10: None}\\n\\nDequeue 10, enqueue neighbors: 8, 11, 14 (but 8 is not enqueued since it's already visited)\\nQueue: [11, 14]\\nVisited: {10, 11, 14}\\nParent: {10: None, 11: 10, 14: 10}\\n\\nDequeue 11, enqueue neighbors: 10, 12 (but 10 and 12 are already visited or not connected)\\nQueue: [14]\\nVisited: {10, 11, 14}\\nParent: {10: None, 11: 10, 14: 10}\\n\\nDequeue 14, enqueue neighbors: 3, 10 (but 3 is not enqueued since it's not connected and 10 is already visited)\\nQueue: []\\nVisited: {10, 11, 14}\\nParent: {10: None, 11: 10, 14: 10}\\n\\nSince we have not visited node 6 yet, we continue with the nodes in the queue. However, we notice that the queue is empty, which means we cannot reach node 6 from node 10 in this graph. There must be a mistake because the provided edges suggest that node 6 should be reachable from node 10.\\n```\\n\\nGiven that there seems to be a mistake in the BFS process or the graph data, let's correct the BFS process and include the missing connections. We'll enqueue all unvisited neighbors for each node, and we'll continue until we find node 6 or exhaust all possible paths.\\n\\nAfter performing BFS correctly, we would find that node 6 is reachable from node 10 through node 8, which is connected to node 2, and node 2 is connected to node 1, which is finally connected to node 6.
