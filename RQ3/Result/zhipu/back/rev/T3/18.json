BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This characteristic makes BFS ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it ensures that the first time it visits a node, it has found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1.
