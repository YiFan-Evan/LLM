BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at their respective depths, starting from the root node.

Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the distances from the start node to each visited node, as well as the predecessors of each node (to reconstruct the path later).\\n\\n2.
