Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set or a dictionary to track visited nodes and the path taken to reach them.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node and examine its neighbors.\\n4. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited, record the node that led to its discovery (to reconstruct the path later), and enqueue it.\\n5. Once the destination node is dequeued, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the destination node to the start node using the recorded nodes that led to each visited node.\\n6.
