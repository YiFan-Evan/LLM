Here's how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has a weight of 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given graph:\\n\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 6], [1, 4], [2, 3], [2, 7], [5, 6], [6, 7]]}\\nStart node: 0\\nDestination: 5\\n\\nWe start from node 0, setting its distance to 0 and all others to infinity.

The algorithm proceeds as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize the distance to the start node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.\\n2. Set the start node as the current node.\\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the distance from the start node through the current node to the neighbor.\\n4.
