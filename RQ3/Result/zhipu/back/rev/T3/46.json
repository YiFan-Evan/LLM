BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges from the source node to any other node. This is particularly useful in unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is done so via the shortest path.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the starting node).\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target, the path leading to this node is the shortest path.\\n4. Otherwise, for each of the node's neighbors that hasn't been visited yet, enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path.\\n5.
