BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to visit and is particularly useful for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is done so via the shortest path from the start node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS can be applied to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path taken to reach it (initially just the start node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n3. If the dequeued node is the target node, the path to this node is the shortest path.\\n4. If not, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited yet, enqueue the neighbor along with the path updated to include this neighbor.\\n5. Repeat the process until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the provided graph to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 2:\\n\\nGiven the graph: \\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n- Edges: [[0, 4], [1, 6], [2, 3], [2, 7], [3, 5], [4, 7], [6, 7]]\\n\\nStarting at node 4, we will follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Enqueue (4, [4]) since 4 is the start node.\\n2. Dequeue (4, [4]), visit it, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors with updated paths: (0, [4, 0]), (7, [4, 7]).\\n3. Dequeue (0, [4, 0]), visit it, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors with updated paths: (4, [4, 0, 4]) is not enqueued because we've already visited node 4, and there are no other edges from node 0 to visit.\\n4. Dequeue (7, [4, 7]), visit it, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors with updated paths: (4, [4, 7, 4]) is not enqueued for the same reason, (6, [4, 7, 6]) is enqueued.\\n5. Dequeue (6, [4, 7, 6]), visit it, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors with updated paths: (1, [4, 7, 6, 1]) is enqueued, (7, [4, 7, 6, 7]) is not enqueued because we've already visited node 7.\\n6. Dequeue (1, [4, 7, 6, 1]), visit it, and enqueue its unvisited neighbors with updated paths: (6, [4, 7, 6, 1, 6]) is not enqueued because we've already visited node 6.\\n7. At this point, we have not yet visited node 2, and we need to continue exploring. However, looking at the edges, we see that node 2 is connected to node 3, and node 3 is connected to node 5, but there is no direct connection to node 2 from any of the nodes we've visited so far. We have to backtrack to find the connection.\\n\\nBacktracking from node 7 to node 2, we see that node 2 is connected to node 7. So, we update our path when we visit node 7 to include node 2 as well: (2, [4, 7, 2]).\\n\\n8.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node (4) along with the path taken to reach it (initially just [4]).\\n2. Dequeue node 4 and examine its neighbors. Node 4 has neighbors 0 and 7.\\n3. Since we are looking for the shortest path to node 7, and node 7 is a direct neighbor of node 4, we can immediately see that the shortest path from node 4 to node 7 is simply [4, 7].\\n4.
