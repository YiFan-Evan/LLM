BFS is particularly well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it explores nodes in layers, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path from the source.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind BFS is to start at the source node, enqueue it, and mark it as visited. Then, while the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors. We keep track of the level of each node, which corresponds to the number of edges in the shortest path from the source to that node. We also maintain a predecessor map to reconstruct the path once we reach the destination.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the algorithm:\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node.\\n2. Keep a track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Keep a predecessor map to store the parent of each node.\\n4. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue the node and process it.\\n    b. For each unvisited neighbor of this node:\\n        i. Mark it as visited.\\n        ii.
