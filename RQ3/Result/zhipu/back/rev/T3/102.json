It seems I stopped the explanation before completing the shortest path.

Initialize distances: All nodes are set to infinity except for node 10, which is set to 0.\\n2. Node 10 is added to the priority queue with a distance of 0.\\n3. The priority queue will process nodes in order of their tentative distances. Node 10 has the smallest distance, so it is processed first.\\n4. Node 10 has neighbors 6 and 9. Since we're looking for the shortest path to node 9, we'll consider the path to node 9 through node 10 if it's shorter than any previously found path.\\n5. Node 10 to node 6 has a distance of 1, so we update the distance to node 6 to 1 if it was previously set to infinity.\\n6. Node 10 to node 9 is not directly connected, so we look for the next node with the smallest tentative distance. Node 6 has a distance of 1, which is the smallest, so we process node 6 next.\\n7. Node 6 has a neighbor, node 10, which is the start node, and node 10 to node 9 is not directly connected, so we move on to the next smallest distance node, which is node 1 with a distance of 2 (from node 10 through node 6).\\n8. Node 1 has neighbors 9, 10, and 8. We check the distance to node 9 through node 1, which would be 3 (1 -> 9). Since we are looking for the shortest path, we do not update the path to node 9 because we already have a direct path from node 10 to node 9 with a distance of 1.\\n9. We continue this process until we find the shortest path to node 9. Since we found a direct path from node 10 to node 9 with a distance of 1, we do not need to explore further.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->9\""}]
