Initialize a distance dictionary with all nodes set to infinity, except for the start node which is set to 0.\\n2.

The algorithm maintains a set of nodes whose shortest distance from the source is known and iteratively relaxes the distances of adjacent nodes until the shortest path to the target node is determined.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of the steps involved in Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. Once we have considered all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited and remove it from the unvisited set. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7.
