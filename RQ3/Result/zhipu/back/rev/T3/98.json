BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to be explored and is well-suited for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is the shortest path from the start node to that node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS can be applied to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node and a dictionary to keep track of the visited nodes and their parents.\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node. If it is, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target node to the start node using the parent information.\\n3. If the current node is not the target, enqueue all its unvisited neighbors, recording their parent as the current node.\\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\nGraph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 7], [0, 10], [0, 8], [1, 4], [2, 8], [2, 6], [2, 9], [3, 10], [4, 10], [5, 11], [5, 6], [9, 12]]}\\nStart node: 8\\nDestination: 9\\n\\nWe perform BFS starting from node 8, and we find that the shortest path to node 9 is directly through node 2. Here is the sequence of nodes we visit:\\n\\n1. Start at node 8.\\n2. Visit node 2, which is connected to node 8.\\n3.
