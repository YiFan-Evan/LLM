BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph at the present depth level before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. This characteristic of BFS makes it ideal for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs because it ensures that the first time a node is visited, it is done so via the shortest path from the starting node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set to track visited nodes to avoid cycles.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node and mark it as visited.\\n   b. If this node is the target, reconstruct the path from the starting node to the target node using a parent map that keeps track of each node's parent.\\n   c.
