BFS is particularly useful for this purpose because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that the first time it reaches a node, it has found the shortest path to that node from the starting point.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node multiple times.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and add all of its unvisited neighbors to the queue.\\n4. Keep track of the previous node for each node visited, so that we can reconstruct the path once the target is reached.\\n5.
