Since the graph is unweighted (the distances between nodes are not given, implying they are all the same), BFS is a suitable choice. BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in an unweighted graph because it will visit all the neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a high-level explanation of how BFS works to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes.\\n2. Add the starting node to the queue.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node has not been visited, mark it as visited.\\n   c. If this is the target node, backtrack to construct the path.\\n   d.
