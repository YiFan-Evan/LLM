BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed from the source to the target.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of the BFS algorithm applied to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set or a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and the nodes from which they were visited (their parents).\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node from the queue.\\n   b. If this node has not been visited, mark it as visited.\\n   c. For each adjacent node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Also, record the current node as the parent of this adjacent node.\\n4. Once the target node is dequeued and marked as visited, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent pointers to reconstruct the path.\\n5. Format the path as specified.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph with the start node 16 and the destination node 18.\\n\\nApplying BFS, we would start at node 16, and eventually, we would reach node 18. To give you the shortest path, we need to backtrack from node 18 to node 16 using the parent pointers that BFS would have set up during the traversal.\\n\\nSince I can't execute code, I'll walk you through the steps conceptually:\\n\\n1. Node 16 is visited and its neighbors (11 and 22) are added to the queue.\\n2. Node 11 is visited next, and it adds nodes 16 and 22 to the queue (but 16 is already visited, so it's skipped).\\n3. Node 22 is visited, and it adds node 21 to the queue.\\n4. Node 21 is visited, and it adds node 23 to the queue.\\n5. Node 23 is visited, and it adds node 9 to the queue.\\n6. Node 9 is visited, and it adds nodes 11, 20, and 23 to the queue (11 and 23 are already visited, so they are skipped).\\n7. Node 20 is visited, and it adds node 24 to the queue.\\n8. Node 24 is visited, and it adds node 1 to the queue.\\n9. Node 1 is visited, and it adds nodes 5, 13, 10, and 24 to the queue (24 is already visited, so it's skipped).\\n10. Node 10 is visited, and it adds nodes 1 and 4 to the queue (1 is already visited, so it's skipped).\\n11. Node 4 is visited, and it adds nodes 10 and 19 to the queue (10 is already visited, so it's skipped).\\n12. Node 19 is visited, and it adds nodes 4, 15, and 7 to the queue (4 is already visited, so it's skipped).\\n13. Node 7 is visited, and it adds node 19 to the queue (19 is already visited, so it's skipped).\\n14. Node 15 is visited, and it adds node 14 to the queue.\\n15. Node 14 is visited, and it adds node 15 to the queue (15 is already visited, so it's skipped).\\n16.
