BFS is a traversal for a tree or graph data structure. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores all of its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of nodes to be explored, and it also maintains a set (or a dictionary in some cases) to keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path in an unweighted graph:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path to reach it (initially, it's just the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node and its path from the queue.\\n3. If the dequeued node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n4. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node, if the neighbor has not been visited, enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path to reach it.\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or the target is found.\\n\\nLet's apply this to the given graph.\\n\\nStarting with node 6, we will perform BFS to find the shortest path to node 10. I'll outline the steps without showing the full BFS traversal process:\\n\\n1. Enqueue node 6 with path [6].\\n2. Dequeue node 6 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (0 and 10) with updated paths: [6->0] and [6->10].\\n3.
