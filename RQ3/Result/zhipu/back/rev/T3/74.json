BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have taken the shortest path because all edges have the same weight (or cost).\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially just the starting node).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node and the path leading to it.\\n   b. If the dequeued node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of its adjacent nodes, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it along with the updated path leading to it.\\n3. When we find the target node, the path associated with it is the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\nStarting node: 5\\nDestination: 0\\n\\nGraph structure:\\n- Nodes: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\\n- Edges: 0-5, 0-6, 1-2, 1-5, 2-3, 4-6, 6-7\\n\\nUsing BFS, we start at node 5 and explore its neighbors (0 and 6).
