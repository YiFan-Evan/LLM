BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node. The algorithm uses a queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored and a dictionary (or a similar data structure) to record the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node.\\n2. Keep a dictionary to track visited nodes and their shortest path from the start node.\\n3. Dequeue a node from the queue and examine it.\\n4. If the node is the target, we have found our shortest path.\\n5. Otherwise, for each of its neighbors, if the neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it. Record the path to this neighbor by appending it to the path of the current node.\\n6. Repeat the process until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3:\\n\\n- Start at node 2, enqueue it.\\n- Visit node 2, mark it as visited.\\n- Explore neighbors of node 2: nodes 4 and 12.\\n- Enqueue node 4 and node 12 with the path \\\"2->4\\\" and \\\"2->12\\\".\\n- Dequeue node 4, it has not been visited, mark it as visited.\\n- Explore neighbors of node 4: no neighbors lead to node 3.\\n- Dequeue node 12, it has not been visited, mark it as visited.\\n- Explore neighbors of node 12: no neighbors lead to node 3.\\n- Go back to the queue and continue with the next node, which is node 4.\\n- Continue exploring the neighbors of the nodes until node 3 is found.\\n\\nFollowing this process, we will eventually find that the shortest path from node 2 to node 3 involves going from node 2 to node 1 and then from node 1 to node 3.

At this point, we need to look at the next level of nodes. Node 1 is a neighbor of node 2, but since we are using BFS, we must process nodes in the order they were enqueued. We will enqueue the neighbors of nodes 4 and 12 next.\\n8. Node 4 does not have node 1 as a neighbor, so we move to node 12's neighbors.\\n9. Node 12 does not have node 1 as a neighbor either, so we continue with the next nodes in the queue.\\n10. Eventually, we will process node 1 as a neighbor of node 2. Since node 1 is the destination, we stop and reconstruct the path from node 2 to node 1.\\n\\nThe shortest path from node 2 to node 1 is found directly since node 1 is a neighbor of node 2.
