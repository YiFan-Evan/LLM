BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node from the starting node. This is because the first time we visit a node, we are guaranteed to have found the shortest path to that node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm applied to find the shortest path from a start node to a target node:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. Also, keep a dictionary or an array to store the parent of each node. This will help us reconstruct the path once we reach the target node.\\n4. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n5. If the node is the target node, we stop and reconstruct the path from the start node to the target node using the parent dictionary.\\n6. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited, mark it as visited, add it to the queue, and record its parent.\\n7. Once we reach the target node, we backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent links to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the provided graph to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3:\\n\\nGiven graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n- Edges: [[0, 7], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 6], [2, 4], [3, 5], [6, 7]]\\n\\nStarting node: 0\\nDestination node: 3\\n\\nUsing BFS, we would traverse the graph as follows:\\n\\n1. Enqueue start node (0)\\n2. Dequeue node 0, mark it as visited, and set its parent to None (since it's the start node)\\n3. Enqueue neighbors of node 0 (which are 7)\\n4. Dequeue node 7, mark it as visited, and set its parent to 0\\n5. Enqueue neighbors of node 7 (none are in the direction of node 3, so we continue)\\n6. Enqueue node 1 (next unvisited node)\\n7. Dequeue node 1, mark it as visited, and set its parent to None\\n8. Enqueue neighbors of node 1 (which are 2, 3, and 6)\\n9. Dequeue node 3 (destination reached)\\n10.
