Start from the initial node and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited, mark it as visited, record the node that led to its discovery (this is important for reconstructing the path later), and enqueue it.\\n4.

Since we didn't record the actual paths during the BFS, let's do a quick reconstruction based on the graph's edges:\\n\\n- The shortest path to node 4 from node 0 goes through node 5, then node 7, then node 8, then node 11, and finally node 9.\\n- So, the path is 0 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 11 -> 9 -> 4.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->5->7->8->11->9->4\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 13], [0, 5], [1, 9], [2, 11], [2, 14], [3, 12], [3, 13], [4, 9], [5, 7], [6, 14], [7, 8], [8, 11], [9, 11], [10, 14]]} The start node: 0 The destination: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node 0 to the destination node 9, we can again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, as it is well-suited for unweighted graphs like the one provided.
