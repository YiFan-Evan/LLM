BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored, which inherently makes it suitable for finding the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed from the source node.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node and mark it as visited.\\n   b. If this node is the target, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, enqueue all of its unvisited neighboring nodes.\\n3. Keep track of the previous node for each visited node to reconstruct the path once the target is reached.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 6.\\n- Enqueue node 6.\\n- Dequeue node 6 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors (none in this case, since we haven't visited any nodes yet).\\n- Since node 6 is connected to node 7, enqueue node 7.\\n- Dequeue node 7 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: node 2 is the only unvisited neighbor of 7.\\n- Dequeue node 2 and enqueue its unvisited neighbors: nodes 0, 4, and 7 are neighbors of 2, but 7 has been visited already.\\n- Continue this process until we enqueue node 3 (the destination).\\n\\nTo reconstruct the path, we keep track of the parent of each node visited. When we reach the target node, we backtrack from the target to the start by following the parents.\\n\\nNow, let's find the shortest path from node 6 to node 3:\\n\\n1. Node 6 -> Node 7 (since 6 is connected to 7)\\n2. Node 7 -> Node 2 (since 7 is connected to 2)\\n3.
