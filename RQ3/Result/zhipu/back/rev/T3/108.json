The principle behind BFS is to explore all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path because all previous paths to that node were longer.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of the BFS algorithm applied to this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path to that node (initially, just the start node).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n3. Check if this node is the target. If it is, we have found our shortest path.\\n4. If not, for each adjacent node, if it has not been visited yet, enqueue it with the updated path leading to it.\\n5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the queue is empty or we have found the target node.\\n\\nLet's apply this algorithm to the given graph with start node 9 and destination node 3:\\n\\n1. Start with node 9 in the queue: `[9]`.\\n2. Dequeue 9, it's not the target. Enqueue its neighbors (6 and 9 are already visited, so we skip them): `[6, 9]` with paths `[9->6]` and `[9->9]`.\\n3.

Enqueue its unvisited neighbors (10 and 3 are not visited): `[10, 3, 9]` with paths `[9->6->5->10]`, `[9->6->2->3]`, and `[9->9]`.\\n6. Dequeue 3, it's the target.
