BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path because all edges have the same weight (in this case, we can consider each edge to have a weight of 1).\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how BFS works in the context of finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Start at the given starting node and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of this node, if the neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited, record the node from which it was reached (this helps in reconstructing the path later), and enqueue it.\\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty or the target node is reached.\\n5. Once the target node is reached, backtrack using the recorded nodes from which each visited node was reached to construct the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 8 to node 7:\\n\\n1. Start at node 8, enqueue it, and mark it as visited.\\n2. Dequeue node 8, and look at its neighbors (2, 7, and 13).\\n3. Node 2 has been visited before, so we skip it. Node 13 has also been visited, so we skip it as well. Node 7 has not been visited, so we mark it as visited, record that we reached it from node 8, and enqueue it.\\n4. Since we've reached our target node, we can stop here.\\n\\nNow, we backtrack from node 7 to node 8 to construct the path:\\n\\n- Node 7 was reached from node 8, so the path is 8 -> 7.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->7.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 14], [1, 5], [1, 13], [1, 8], [2, 10], [2, 8], [2, 6], [4, 7], [5, 9], [6, 12], [6, 14], [7, 8], [11, 13]]} The start node: 8 The destination:  7.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Apologies for the oversight in my previous response.
