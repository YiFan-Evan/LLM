BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we first reach any node, we have found the shortest path to that node. This is because BFS guarantees that the first time a node is visited, it is done so by traversing the shortest path from the start node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node itself).\\n2. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\\n   a. Dequeue the first element from the queue. This element is a node along with the path taken to reach it.\\n   b. If the current node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each of the current node's neighbors that have not been visited yet, enqueue them along with the updated path that includes the current node.\\n3. Once the target node is dequeued, the path associated with it is the shortest path from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given graph with the start node as 6 and the destination as 4.\\n\\n1. Enqueue node 6 with the path [6].\\n2. Dequeue node 6, and enqueue its neighbors (21, 12) with updated paths.\\n3.
