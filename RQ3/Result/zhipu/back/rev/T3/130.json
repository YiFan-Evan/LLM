BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we first reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node from the starting point. This is because BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of the BFS algorithm:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n    a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n    b. If this node is the target, we've found the shortest path.\\n    c. If not, enqueue all its unvisited neighboring nodes and record their parent (the node from which they were found) to reconstruct the path later.\\n4. Once the target is found, backtrack from the target to the start using the recorded parent nodes to construct the path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the provided graph to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 10.\\n\\nStarting from node 6, we would follow these steps:\\n\\n- Node 6 is added to the queue.\\n- Node 6 is visited and its neighbors (11, 13) are added to the queue.\\n- Node 11 is visited, but it does not lead to the destination. Its neighbors (1, 2) are already visited or not connected to 11.\\n- Node 13 is visited, but it does not lead to the destination either.
