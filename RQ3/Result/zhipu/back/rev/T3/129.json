Since the provided graph does not specify weights for the edges, I will use BFS, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works by exploring the graph level by level, beginning with the starting node. It keeps track of all the nodes that have been visited to avoid processing a node more than once and maintains a queue of nodes to be explored. For each node it visits, BFS also keeps track of the path taken to reach that node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path to reach it (initially just the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue the first node from the queue and examine it.\\n3. If the current node is the target, return the path to it.\\n4. Otherwise, for each of the current node's neighbors that have not been visited, enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path.\\n5.

Enqueue node 6 with path [6].\\n2. Dequeue node 6, visit its neighbors 7 and 12. Enqueue them with paths [6->7] and [6->12].\\n3. Dequeue node 7, visit its neighbor 14. Enqueue it with path [6->7->14]. Dequeue node 12, visit its neighbors 8 and 13. Enqueue them with paths [6->12->8] and [6->12->13].\\n4. Continue this process.

BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the root node (the starting node in our case), and keeps track of the paths leading to each node it explores. The first time it encounters the target node, it has found the shortest path because BFS explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nGiven the graph with nodes 0 through 14 and the edges provided, we want to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 2 using BFS.

Enqueue [6->12->8] and [6->12->13].\\n- Dequeue node 8, its unvisited neighbors are nodes 13 and 12 (which is already visited), so only enqueue [6->12->8->13].\\n- Dequeue node 13, its unvisited neighbors are nodes 8 and 9 (both already visited), so no new nodes to enqueue.\\n- Dequeue node 14, its unvisited neighbors are none (all are visited), so no new nodes to enqueue.\\n- Dequeue node 12 (again), since we found a new path to it through node 8. Its unvisited neighbors are nodes 2 and 8 (which is already visited), so enqueue [6->2].\\n- Dequeue node 2, which is our target, and return the path [6->2].\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->2\""}]
