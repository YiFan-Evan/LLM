BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed from the source node to any other node.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue.\\n4. For each of the neighbors of this node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\\n5. Also, keep track of the previous node for each visited node to reconstruct the path.\\n6. When the target node is dequeued, backtrack using the previous node information to construct the path from the start node to the target node.\\n\\nNow, let's apply BFS to the given graph to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 6:\\n\\nGiven graph:\\n- Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\\n- Edges: [[0, 7], [1, 5], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 7], [4, 5], [6, 7]]\\n\\nStarting at node 2, we will explore its neighbors (4), and from there, we continue to explore until we reach node 6.

Node 5 is connected to node 6, which is our target.\\n5. We have reached the target node, so we backtrack to find the shortest path.\\n\\nBacktracking from node 6, we find that its previous node was 5, and the previous node of 5 was 4, and the previous node of 4 was 2.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->4->5->6\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 5], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 7], [4, 5], [6, 7]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the shortest path from the start node to the destination in the given graph, we can once again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, as it is well-suited for unweighted graphs and guarantees the shortest path in terms of the number of edges.\\n\\nHere's how we can apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 5:\\n\\n1.
