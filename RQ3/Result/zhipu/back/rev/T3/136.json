The algorithm works by iteratively finding the shortest path to all vertices from the starting vertex. It keeps a set of unvisited vertices and calculates tentative distances, which are updated as the algorithm finds shorter paths. Once a vertex's shortest distance is finalized, it is moved to a set of visited vertices.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of Dijkstra's algorithm:\\n\\n1. Mark all nodes unvisited. Create a set of all the unvisited nodes called the unvisited set.\\n2. Assign to every node a tentative distance value: set it to zero for our initial node and to infinity for all other nodes.\\n3. Set the initial node as the current node.\\n4. For the current node, consider all of its unvisited neighbors and calculate their tentative distances through the current node. Compare the newly calculated tentative distance to the current assigned value and assign the smaller one. For example, if the current node A is marked with a distance of 6, and the edge connecting it with a neighbor B has length 2, then the distance to B through A will be 6 + 2 = 8. If B was previously marked with a distance greater than 8 then change it to 8. Otherwise, keep the current value.\\n5. After considering all of the unvisited neighbors of the current node, mark the current node as visited. A visited node will not be checked again.\\n6. If the destination node has been marked visited (when planning a route between two specific nodes) or if the smallest tentative distance among the nodes in the unvisited set is infinity (when planning a complete traversal; occurs when there is no connection between the initial node and remaining unvisited nodes), then stop. The algorithm has finished.\\n7. Otherwise, select the unvisited node that is marked with the smallest tentative distance, set it as the new \\\"current node,\\\" and go back to step 4.\\n\\nNow, let's apply this to the given graph with the start node 6 and the destination node 12.\\n\\n1. Initialize the distances with infinity, except for the start node (node 6), which is set to 0.\\n2. Node 6 is the current node. Its neighbors are nodes 7, 14, and 5. Update their tentative distances.\\n3. Choose the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, which is node 5 or node 7 or node 14.\\n4. Repeat the process, updating the distances to the neighbors of the current node.\\n5. Continue this process until we reach node 12 or all nodes are visited.\\n\\nAfter applying the algorithm, we find that the shortest path from node 6 to node 12 is through node 5, then node 12. So the path is 6->5->12.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->5->12\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 12], [1, 8], [1, 13], [2, 13], [2, 12], [3, 10], [3, 13], [4, 9], [5, 12], [5, 6], [6, 7], [6, 14], [8, 9], [9, 11]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve this problem, we will once again use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.
