BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from a given source node, and keeps track of the shortest path from the source to each visited node.

Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path to it (initially just the node itself).\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node and its path.\\n   b. If the current node is the target, return the path as the shortest path.\\n   c. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited yet, enqueue the neighbor along with the updated path.\\n3.

Dequeue node 4 and explore its neighbors (5 and 6). Since 6 is already in the path, we skip it.\\n5. Enqueue node 5 with the updated path [6->4->5].\\n6. Dequeue node 5 and explore its neighbors (9). Enqueue node 9 with the updated path [6->4->5->9].\\n7. Dequeue node 14 and explore its neighbors (10 and 12). Enqueue node 10 with the updated path [6->14->10].\\n8.
