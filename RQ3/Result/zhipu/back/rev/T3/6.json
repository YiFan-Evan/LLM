BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path since all edges are considered to have equal weight.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for our purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of the shortest path found so far.\\n2. Dequeue a node from the queue and examine it.\\n3. If this node is the target node, we stop and backtrack through the dictionary to find the shortest path.\\n4.
