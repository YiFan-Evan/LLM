BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path to each node from the starting node. This is because the first time a node is visited, it is the shortest distance from the start node since BFS explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step explanation of how BFS works for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the starting node itself).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue and examine it.\\n3. If the node is the target, return the path leading to this node as the shortest path.\\n4. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node, if the neighbor has not been visited, enqueue the neighbor along with the path leading to it.\\n5.
