BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges traversed. Here's how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to keep track of each node's parent.\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the next node and explore its neighbors.\\n3. For each unvisited neighbor, record the current node as its parent and enqueue the neighbor.\\n4.
