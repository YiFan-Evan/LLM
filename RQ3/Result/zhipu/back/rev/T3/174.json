BFS is ideal for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has taken the shortest path possible.\\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works by starting at the root node (the starting point) and exploring all its neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue to keep track of the next node to explore and a set or a dictionary to keep track of the nodes already visited and their parents (to reconstruct the path).\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting node along with its path (initially just the starting node).\\n2. Dequeue a node from the queue and check if it is the target node.\\n3. If it is, the path to the target is found.\\n4. If not, enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors to the queue with the updated path.\\n5. Mark the node as visited.\\n6. Repeat the process until the target node is found or the queue is empty.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph, starting from node 22 and looking for the shortest path to node 5:\\n\\n1. Start from node 22, enqueue it with the path [22].\\n2. Dequeue node 22, it's not the target. Enqueue its neighbors (15 and 10) with the updated paths [22, 15] and [22, 10].\\n3. Dequeue node 15, it's not the target. It has no unvisited neighbors, so skip it.\\n4. Dequeue node 10, it's not the target. Enqueue its neighbors (22, 24) with the updated paths [22, 10, 22] (which is a cycle and should not be enqueued) and [22, 10, 24].\\n5. Dequeue node 24, it's not the target. Enqueue its neighbors (10, 11, 12) with the updated paths [22, 10, 24, 10] (cycle, skip), [22, 10, 24, 11], and [22, 10, 24, 12].\\n6. Continue this process, keeping track of visited nodes to avoid cycles, until node 5 is dequeued.\\n\\nSince I can't run an actual BFS algorithm here, I'll describe the steps conceptually. When we reach node 5, we will have found the shortest path. Now, let's find the shortest path from node 22 to node 5 step by step:\\n\\n- From node 22, we visit node 15 and node 10.\\n- From node 10, we visit node 24.\\n- From node 24, we visit node 11, node 12, and node 5 (since there is an edge [5, 24]).\\n- We have reached the target node 5.\\n\\nReconstructing the path, we go from node 5 to its parent (which is node 24 in this case), and continue this until we reach the starting node 22.
