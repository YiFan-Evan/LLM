BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path to it. \\n\\nThe BFS algorithm works as follows:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the starting node to it.\\n2. Keep a set or a dictionary to keep track of visited nodes and the paths taken to reach them.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n   c.

From 13, we reach node 14 and enqueue it with the path (7->9->13->14), but there's no direct path to 8 from 14.\\n6.
