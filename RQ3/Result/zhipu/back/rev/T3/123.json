Since we are looking for the shortest path in an unweighted graph (where all edges have equal weight), BFS is a suitable and efficient choice.\\n\\nBFS works by exploring the graph level by level, beginning with the starting node. It keeps track of the nodes that have been visited and the shortest path to each visited node. It uses a queue to keep track of the next nodes to explore. When a node is dequeued, it is visited, and its neighbors are enqueue if they haven't been visited yet. Each visited node keeps a record of the node from which it was reached.\\n\\nHere's a step-by-step approach for BFS:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a set to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b. If this node is the destination, reconstruct the path from the start node to the destination node.\\n   c. If it is not the destination, mark it as visited and enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors.\\n4.
