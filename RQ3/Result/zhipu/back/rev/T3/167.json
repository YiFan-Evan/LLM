BFS is a traversal algorithm that explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we visit all the neighbors of a node before moving on to nodes that are further away. This characteristic of BFS makes it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs because it guarantees that the first time we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path to it.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a record of visited nodes to avoid processing the same node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty, remove the node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node.\\n4. If it is the target node, we have found the shortest path.\\n5. If not, add all unvisited neighbors of the current node to the queue and mark the current node as visited.\\n6.
