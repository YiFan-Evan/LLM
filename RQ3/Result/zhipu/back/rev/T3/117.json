BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when we reach a node, we have found the shortest path to that node from the starting point. BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\\n\\nHere's a high-level description of the BFS algorithm applied to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node.\\n2. Keep a set or a list to record visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n3. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\\n   b.

Node 4 is skipped as it's already visited.
