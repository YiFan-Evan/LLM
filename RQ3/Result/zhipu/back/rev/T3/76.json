BFS is particularly well-suited for this task because it explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has done so via the shortest path in an unweighted graph.\\n\\nThe principles behind BFS are as follows:\\n\\n1. Start from the initial node and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. For each neighbor of the dequeued node, if it has not been visited, mark it as visited, enqueue it, and record the node from which it was reached.\\n4.
