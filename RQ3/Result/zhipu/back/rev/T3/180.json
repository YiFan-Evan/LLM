The BFS algorithm works by exploring all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. It uses a queue data structure to keep track of the nodes to be explored and maintains a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node.\\n\\nHere's a high-level overview of the steps involved in BFS for finding the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node to it.\\n2. Keep a dictionary to store the shortest path to each node.
