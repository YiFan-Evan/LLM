BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that we find the shortest path in terms of the number of edges from the source node to all other nodes.\\n\\nHere's how BFS works for this problem:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue with the starting node and a dictionary to track the paths to each node.\\n2. While the queue is not empty:\\n   a. Dequeue the next node to visit.\\n   b. For each of its adjacent nodes, if the node has not been visited yet, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\\n   c. Record the path to this node by appending it to the path of the current node.\\n3. Once the target node is dequeued, the path to it will be the shortest, as BFS guarantees that the first time a node is visited is via the shortest path.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph with the start node 5 and the destination node 4:\\n\\n- Start with node 5 in the queue. There are no paths recorded yet.\\n- Dequeue node 5, and explore its adjacent nodes: there are edges to nodes 4 and 6.\\n- Node 4 is the destination, so we have found the shortest path: 5->4.\\n\\nSince we reached the destination node immediately, the path is already the shortest.
