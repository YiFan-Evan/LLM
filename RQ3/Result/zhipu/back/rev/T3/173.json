BFS is a traversal technique that explores vertices layer by layer, meaning it first explores all the neighbors of a node, then the neighbors of those neighbors, and so on. This characteristic makes it suitable for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, as it ensures that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path to it.\\n\\nHere's a brief explanation of how BFS can be used to find the shortest path:\\n\\n1. Start from the source node and enqueue it.\\n2. Dequeue a node and examine it.\\n3. If it is the target node, we stop and backtrack the path.\\n4. Otherwise, enqueue all of its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet.\\n5. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n6.
