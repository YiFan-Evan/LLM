BFS explores the graph level by level, ensuring that when it reaches the target node, it has found the shortest path from the start node to the target.\\n\\nHere's a brief overview of how BFS works for this purpose:\\n\\n1. Initialize a queue and enqueue the start node along with the path taken to reach it (initially, just the start node).\\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the first element.\\n3. If the current node is the target node, return the path.\\n4. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node, if it has not been visited, enqueue it with the updated path.\\n5. Mark the visited nodes to avoid processing a node more than once.\\n\\nLet's apply BFS to the given graph:\\n\\n- Start at node 0.\\n- Enqueue node 0 with path [0].\\n- Dequeue node 0, and enqueue its neighbors (3 and 7) with paths [0->3] and [0->7].\\n- Dequeue node 3.
