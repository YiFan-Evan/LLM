This implies that the surface he was riding on extended out into the ocean, which is not typical for a mountain, cliff, or gorge as these are more commonly features that rise above the surrounding terrain. A \\\"fancy\\\" doesn't relate to a surface on which one could ride. A sandplain, on the other hand, could be a flat area that extends towards the ocean, such as a beach or a dune system.

A gorge is a deep narrow valley with steep sides, which doesn't fit the description as it would imply a significant drop-off before reaching the ocean. A cliff is a similar feature, characterized by a steep rock face, which again would not allow for riding right up to the ocean. A fancy is not a type of terrain at all, so it can be ruled out. A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land, which would not typically end at the ocean in a way that allows for riding right up to it. A sandplain, on the other hand, is a flat, level area of sand that could extend towards the ocean, such as a coastal plain or a beach. This is the type of terrain that would most likely allow someone to ride until they reach the ocean.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. sandplain\""}]
