Phlegm - While phlegm can be spit out, it is produced in the respiratory system, not the mouth, and is generally associated with mucus from a cold or allergies.\\nB. Saliva and mouth - This option is redundant since \\\"saliva\\\" is the correct term for the substance in question, and \\\"mouth\\\" is not an amount that can be increased by spitting.\\nC. Disease - Spitting does not inherently cause disease, although it can spread germs that may lead to disease.\\nD. Germs - While spitting can indeed spread germs, the question is specifically asking about the substance that would be in excess, not the potential consequences of spitting.\\nE.
