It may lead to increased vigilance to prevent falls and injuries, and it can be a period of frustration for the baby as they are mastering this skill.\\n\\nE. \\\"arrive early\\\" - If a baby arrives early, meaning they are born premature, it can indeed cause significant challenges for the parents and the baby, including potential health issues and the need for specialized care.\\n\\nBoth D and E are reasonable choices for what makes raising a baby difficult, but E is more directly related to a specific problem that can arise in raising a baby, as it can lead to immediate and serious challenges.
