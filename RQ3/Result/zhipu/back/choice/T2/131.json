Tension - While competing in a chess game could cause tension due to the competitive nature of the game, the cold environment is not specifically related to causing tension.\\nE.

Frostbite - This is a direct negative effect of cold weather.

Tension - While competing in a chess game can cause tension due to the competitive nature of the game, the cold weather itself does not inherently cause tension.\\\\nC. Sweat - sweating is a response to heat, not cold, so it is not a relevant effect of competing in a chess game on a cold day.\\\\nD.
