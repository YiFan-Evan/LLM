When discussing taxes, the term \\\"back taxes\\\" refers to taxes that were not paid when they were initially due. This implies that Joe has an obligation from previous periods.

Option C (\\\"main\\\") is vague and does not specifically relate to the timing of tax obligations. Option D (\\\"front\\\") is a repetition and also not relevant to tax terminology.
