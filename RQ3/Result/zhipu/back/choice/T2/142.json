Count to ten - While basic numerical skills can be introduced to children, this is not always a skill that every child has mastered before starting school.\\n\\nB. State name - Knowing and being able to state one's own name is indeed an important skill for a child to have before starting school, as it is often one of the first things they are asked to do.\\n\\nC.

It involves interacting with peers and adults, taking turns, sharing, and following social rules, which are essential for a child's success in school.\\n\\nB. Clean room - While being able to clean up after oneself is a useful skill, it is not typically a priority in terms of readiness for school.\\n\\nC.
