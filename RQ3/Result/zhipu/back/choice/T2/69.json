A hen house is not a natural habitat for a fox; it is an area where domestic chickens are kept, and while foxes may occasionally enter such places to prey on chickens, it is not their natural habitat.\\n\\nB. A burrow, on the other hand, is a natural shelter that foxes can dig or take over from other animals.
