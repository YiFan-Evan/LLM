Punctured - If a basketball has a hole in it, it has indeed been punctured. This statement would be true.\\n\\nB. Popular in America - The popularity of basketball in America is not affected by the condition of a single basketball, so this statement is irrelevant to the question and would still be true.\\n\\nC. Full of air - A basketball is designed to be inflated with air. If it has a hole but does not lose its general shape, it may still be mostly full of air, depending on the size of the hole and how quickly air escapes. This statement could be true.\\n\\nD. Gone - The term \\\"gone\\\" implies that the basketball no longer exists or is no longer there. However, the question states that the basketball does not lose its general shape, which implies that it is still present and intact, just with a hole. Therefore, this statement would not be true.\\n\\nE. Round - The shape of the basketball is not specified to change due to the hole, and the question implies that it retains its general shape.
