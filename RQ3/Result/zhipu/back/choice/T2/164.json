Let's analyze the options:\\n\\nA. lot of - This phrase is commonly used to indicate a large amount of something, making it a suitable opposite for \\\"a little.\\\"\\n\\nB. big - This term usually refers to the size or extent of something, not the quantity. Therefore, it is not the direct opposite of \\\"a little.\\\"\\n\\nC. more - This term suggests an amount greater than a specified amount, but it doesn't inherently mean a large amount by itself. It would be more appropriate if it were used in a comparative context (e.g., \\\"more than a little\\\").\\n\\nD. plenty - This term means sufficient or more than enough, which implies a large amount. It can be considered an opposite to \\\"a little.\\\"\\n\\nE. much - This term is often used to indicate a large amount of something, especially when it is uncountable. It is a suitable opposite for \\\"a little.\\\"\\n\\nBoth A (lot of) and E (much) are correct in the context of being the opposite of \\\"a little,\\\" but the phrasing of the question suggests a single-word answer. Since \\\"lot of\\\" is a phrase and not a single word, the best single-word answer that captures the essence of the opposite of \\\"a little\\\" is \\\"much.\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: E.\""}]
