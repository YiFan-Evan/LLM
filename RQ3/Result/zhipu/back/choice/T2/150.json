However, if the aircraft cannot find a suitable place to make an emergency landing or does not have enough altitude to glide to a safe location, it may eventually stall due to the loss of lift as airspeed decreases, and then it could crash.

As a result, the aircraft will begin to lose altitude and airspeed. Without engine power, the plane will glide, and as it descends, it may eventually stall if the pilot does not manage the descent properly. A stall occurs when the wings are no longer producing enough lift to support the aircraft's weight, which happens when the angle of attack exceeds the critical angle. The options provided suggest various outcomes, but the most immediate and relevant consequence of losing engine power is not directly addressed by the options.
