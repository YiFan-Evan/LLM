Neighborhood - This term refers to a district or community within a town or city, which also implies the presence of neighbors.\\n\\nC. Mars - Mars is an option that suggests living on another planet, which currently is not a possibility for humans to inhabit full-time due to technological and logistical limitations, though it's a setting where one could theoretically have no neighbors.\\n\\nD.
