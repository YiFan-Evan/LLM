Anemones are marine animals that are often found in tropical and subtropical waters. They are frequently associated with coral reefs but can also be found in other coastal habitats such as tide pools where they attach to rocks and other substrates.\\n\\nLet's analyze the options:\\nA. Flower bed - This is an incorrect option because anemones are marine creatures, not terrestrial plants.\\nB. Tide pool - This is a plausible option because tide pools can be home to a variety of marine life, including anemones.\\nC. Florida Keys - This is also a plausible option because the Florida Keys are in a warm subtropical environment where anemones can be found.\\nD. Coral Sea - While the Coral Sea is a marine environment where anemones could live, it is not off the eastern U.S. It is located off the northeastern coast of Australia.\\nE.
