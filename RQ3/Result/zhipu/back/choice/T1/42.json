Writing sentences on paper does not prevent the pen from drying out; it is actually using the ink.\\nB. Adding ink to the pen is a way to replenish the ink supply, but it does not prevent the existing ink from drying out.\\nC. Ink cartridges are a component of a pen that holds the ink, but simply having them does not prevent the pen from drying out.\\nD. Using caps is a common method to prevent pens from drying out. The cap covers the nib, creating a seal that minimizes the ink's exposure to air, thus slowing down the drying process.\\nE.
