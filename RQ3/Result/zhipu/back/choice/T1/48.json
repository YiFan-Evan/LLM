Strikes are generally a measure of last resort, used by unions to pressure employers into meeting their demands. The demands should be aimed at improving the working conditions, pay, benefits, or other terms of employment for the union members.\\n\\nA. reasonable - This is the most logical answer because the demands made by the union should be ones that are feasible for the employer to meet. Demands that are not reasonable may not be taken seriously and could potentially lead to a longer or unsuccessful strike.\\n\\nB. more money - While unions often demand increased wages, this option is too narrow. Demands could also include better working conditions, benefits, or other non-monetary issues.\\n\\nC. not go to work - This option does not make sense as a demand. It is a consequence of the strike action, not a demand.\\n\\nD. return to work - This would be a demand made by the employer to the union, not the other way around.\\n\\nE. union - This option is vague and does not represent a specific demand.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: A\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What type of demands to the unions need to be making to go off strike?\nOptions: E. union D. return to work C. not go to work B. more money A. reasonable"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The question is essentially a repetition of the previous one, asking what type of demands unions should make to go off strike.
