Homicide - This is the act of one person killing another, which is a clear cause of early death.\\n\\nC. Cinder - This refers to the residual ash and dust left after the combustion of a material. Cinder itself is not typically associated with causing death.\\n\\nD. Nuclear weapons - These are extremely destructive and can cause immediate death as well as long-term effects leading to premature death due to radiation poisoning and other factors.\\n\\nE. Cyanide - This is a highly toxic substance that can quickly cause death by interfering with the body's ability to use oxygen.\\n\\nAll of the options A, B, D, and E can lead to early death. However, since the question asks for what leads to early death in the most general sense, and all the provided options are valid causes, the answer could be seen as a bit ambiguous. But given that the question is asking for a single cause, and all options except C are valid causes, we can infer that the question might be aiming for the most direct and clear cause of early death.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: B.
