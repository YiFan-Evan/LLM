The term \\\"back taxes\\\" refers to taxes that were not paid when they were initially due. It's important to distinguish between different types of taxes and their terms:\\n\\nA. Anterior - This term is typically used in medical or anatomical contexts, referring to the front part of something, and it is not related to taxes.\\nB. Front - This option is identical to option D and seems to be a repetition or error. It doesn't relate to taxes.\\nC. Main - This term is not typically associated with a specific type of tax debt.\\nD. Front - As with option B, this term doesn't relate to taxes.\\nE. Current - This refers to taxes that are due and payable in the current period or taxes that are up to date.
