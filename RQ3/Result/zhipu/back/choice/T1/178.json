When a person buys products in excess, it means they are acquiring more than what is needed or used. This behavior can lead to several potential outcomes.\\n\\nLet's examine the options provided:\\n\\nA. Running out of money - This could be a consequence of buying in excess if the spending is not managed, but it is not the direct result of the act itself.\\nB.
