Let's evaluate each option:\\n\\nA. work - In the context of gym class, \\\"work\\\" could refer to physical work or exercises which indeed require energy.\\n\\nB. tacos - This option is unrelated to needing energy in gym class, as tacos are food and do not require energy to be consumed (though energy is required to prepare them, that's not the context here).\\n\\nC. mass - Mass is a property of objects and does not require energy to exist. It's not an activity that one does in gym class.\\n\\nD. play sports - Playing sports is a physical activity that requires energy, as it involves running, jumping, and other forms of physical exertion.\\n\\nE. wrestle - Wrestling is also a physical activity that requires energy due to the physical contact and effort involved.\\n\\nGiven that both A, D, and E are activities that require energy, the question may be interpreted as asking for a single answer.
