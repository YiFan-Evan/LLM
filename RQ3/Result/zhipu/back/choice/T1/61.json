As of my last update, the newest MLB stadiums are not in these cities, but this information could have changed.\\n\\nTherefore, without current data, I cannot provide a definitive answer. However, if forced to choose based on common knowledge prior to my last update, one might guess between Phoenix (home of the Arizona Diamondbacks, who opened Chase Field in 1998) and San Francisco (home of the Giants, who opened Oracle Park in 2000), with Chicago having Wrigley Field, which is one of the oldest parks in MLB.\\n\\nSince Oracle Park is newer than Chase Field, one might choose:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: D.
