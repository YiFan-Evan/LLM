It is a way for the audience to show their enjoyment, approval, or encouragement to performers.

It is also common in shows (Option D), which can refer to a variety of live performances including but not limited to TV shows, variety shows, or comedy shows. While audiences may clap at the end of a movie (Option C) or during a cinema screening (Option A), it is not as common a practice as it is in live performances.
