Emotions like vengeance or joy can be associated with killing people in certain contexts, but joy is particularly inappropriate as it suggests a positive feeling towards an act that is generally seen as morally wrong and harmful. Going to prison is a consequence, not an emotion, and being afraid is a possible emotion related to the fear of consequences or the act of killing itself, but not the act of killing others.
