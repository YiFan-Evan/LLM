Horses can be judged on appearance in several settings, but the most formal and common place for this to happen is in horse shows or fairs where competitions include conformation classes. These classes are where horses are evaluated based on their physical characteristics and adherence to breed standards.\\n\\nLet's consider the options:\\n\\nA. Race track - Horses are judged here based on their performance in racing, not their appearance.\\nB.
