Falling down - This is a valid reason that could cause someone to suddenly stop running, as a fall would interrupt the running motion.\\n\\nC. Sweating - While sweating is a natural occurrence when running, it doesn't suddenly stop a person. It may lead to discomfort or dehydration over time, but it's not an immediate cause for stopping.\\n\\nD. Exhaustion - Exhaustion could cause a runner to stop, but it typically happens gradually rather than suddenly.\\n\\nE.
