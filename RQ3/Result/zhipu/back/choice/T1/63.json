Reckless - This means acting without proper caution; taking unnecessary risks.\\nB. Bellicose - This describes someone who is quarrelsome or combative; eager to fight.\\nC.

Aggressive - This means acting in a way that is forceful, assertive, and sometimes violet.\\nE. Dauntless - This means fearless or courageous.\\n\\nGiven that the lion sensed his competitor was timid, it would be reasonable for the lion to adopt an attitude that asserts dominance and takes advantage of the competitor's timidity. The lion would likely not need to be defensive or reckless, as the competitor is timid, not particularly threatening. The lion might not be bellicose unless it actively seeks a fight for no other reason than to do harm, which is not implied by the competitor's timidity alone.
