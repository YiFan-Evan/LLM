Disgust - This is an emotional response and does not relate to physical elevation.\\nB. Reduction - This term implies a decrease in size, quantity, or level, which could be related to elevation but is not the direct opposite.\\nC. Depression - In a geographical sense, a depression is a part of the landscape that is lower than its surroundings, which is the direct opposite of an area of elevation.\\nD. Demotion - This term is related to a decrease in status or rank, not to physical elevation.\\nE. Diminishment - Similar to reduction, it implies a decrease but is not specifically related to physical elevation.\\n\\nConsidering these definitions, the option that best fits the description of the opposite of an area of elevation is C.
