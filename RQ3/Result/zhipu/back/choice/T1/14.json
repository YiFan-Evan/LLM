Round - The basketball would likely still be round if it has not lost its general shape, as the shape of a basketball is defined by its outer surface, which would remain spherical unless significantly deflated.\\n\\nD. Gone - The basketball cannot be gone if it is described as having a hole in it but not losing its shape; this implies that it is still present.\\n\\nC. Full of air - While the basketball has a hole, it may not be completely full of air, but the question states that it hasn't lost its general shape. This could still be true if the basketball is mostly full of air and the hole is small enough to prevent significant deflation.\\n\\nB. Popular in America - This statement is unrelated to the physical condition of the basketball. The popularity of the basketball as a sport in America would not be affected by a hole in a specific basketball.\\n\\nA. Punctured - This is the statement that would not be true according to the condition given. The basketball has a hole in it, which means it has indeed been punctured. However, the question is asking for the statement that would not be true, and since having a hole implies it is punctured, this is the incorrect statement in the context of the question.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: A.\""}]
