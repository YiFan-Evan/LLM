A doormat is usually placed where people wipe their shoes before entering a building or a room.

Facade - This refers to the exterior side of a building, which is not a specific location where a doormat would typically be placed.\\n\\nB. Front door - This is a strong candidate because a doormat is often placed directly in front of the front door to serve its purpose.\\n\\nC. Doorway - This is a plausible location, as it could refer to the area immediately in front of any door, including the front door.\\n\\nD. Entrance porch - This is also a possible location, as an entrance porch is an area directly in front of the door where a doormat might be placed.\\n\\nE. Hallway - A hallway is an interior space within a building, and while doormats can be placed inside, it's not typical for them to be there for the purpose of wiping shoes upon entering.\\n\\nConsidering the typical use of a doormat and the common expectation of where one would find it, the best answer would be the one that most directly corresponds to the main entrance of a building.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. front door\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where is a doormat likely to be in front of?\nOptions: E. hallway D. entrance porch C. doorway B. front door A. facade"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"\\\"The principles for solving this question remain the same as previously discussed.
