Since the sentence is discussing the nature of the smile itself, the answer should describe the smile's characteristic, which is happiness.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: C (cry), because it is the only option that makes sense in the context of the sentence when considering the opposite of a smile. However, it seems there might be a mistake in the question as the correct answer should logically be something related to happiness, like \\\"emotion\\\" or \\\"expression,\\\" which are not provided in the options.
