Given the context provided, it is clear that the inability to walk is causing the parents difficulties because they have to constantly lift and carry the baby. This aligns with option B, which states 'learn to walk'. While it's true that learning to walk is a developmental milestone and not the direct cause of difficulty, the inference here is that the baby's inability to walk at a young age is the issue, and 'learn to walk' is the phrasing used to describe this phase.\\\\n\\\\nA.
