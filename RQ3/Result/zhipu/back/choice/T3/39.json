Typically, tickets for seats are purchased for events where seating is assigned or where admission is controlled and requires a ticket. Let's evaluate the options based on this understanding:\\n\\nA. Park - While some parks may have ticketed events or areas, the term \\\"park\\\" by itself does not inherently suggest an event where seats would be ticketed.\\nB. Show - This is a broad term that can include theater productions, concerts, or any similar performance where tickets are commonly sold for assigned seats.\\nC. Auditorium - An auditorium is a venue where events such as concerts, lectures, or presentations take place, and tickets are often sold for seats in such venues.\\nD. Movies - Going to see a movie at a cinema typically involves buying a ticket for a seat in the theater.\\nE. Rest area - Rest areas, often found along highways, are places where travelers can stop to rest and do not usually require tickets for seats.\\n\\nConsidering the context, both B (show), C (auditorium), and D (movies) are events where one might buy tickets for seats. However, since the question asks for a single event, we need to choose the most generic term that encompasses the idea of buying tickets for seats without being too specific. \\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: B.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What event might one buy tickets for seats?
