The fundamental principle here is that housework is typically done to clean and organize a living space, so the most direct result of doing housework would be to address the mess.\\n\\nLet's evaluate the options:\\nA. boredom - This is unlikely because cleaning a mess does not typically alleviate boredom; in fact, it might be seen as an additional task.\\nB. nice home - This could be a consequence of doing housework, but it is a bit abstract compared to the direct action of cleaning.\\nC. michigan - This option is irrelevant as \\\"michigan\\\" is a place and has no connection to the context of housework or a messy house.\\nD. feeling satisfied - This is a possible psychological outcome of completing housework, but it is not the direct result of the action.\\nE. house clean - This is the most direct outcome of doing housework when the house is a mess. Cleaning is the action that directly addresses the mess.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: E.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: His house was a mess, he began doing housework to get what?
