Taking notes - This action requires attention to detail and would likely prevent the juror from zoning out.\\nB. Nodding - This is a common non-verbal way of showing agreement or acknowledgment and can be done without much attention, making it a plausible action for someone zoning out.\\nC. Change of heart - This is not an action but rather an emotional or mental state change, and thus it is not applicable in this context.\\nD. Writing down - Similar to taking notes, this would require focus and effort, which would hinder zoning out.\\nE.
