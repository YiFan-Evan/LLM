(Since the model identified \"tree_skin\" and \"picked_strings\" as important words, it likely determined that the person was picking apples from a tree. \"Fort Wayne\" was also mentioned, which is in Indiana, and the model may have recognized that as a relevant location to the given scenario. Therefore, the model's decision-making process led it to predict that the person is in Indiana.

Since Fort Wayne is a city in Indiana, and the question implies that the activity (picking apples from a tree) is taking place outside of Fort Wayne, it is reasonable to conclude that the location is within the state of Indiana.
