A reception desk is usually located in an area where visitors enter and where they can check in, get information, or be greeted by staff. Let's examine the options:\\n\\nA. Motel - While a reception desk could be found in a motel, the term \\\"front entrance\\\" makes it a bit too specific to just motels.\\nB. Hostel - Similar to a motel, a hostel could have a reception desk, but again, the term is too specific.\\nC. Building - This is a very broad term and could apply to many types of buildings, but it doesn't specify where within the building the reception desk would be located.\\nD. Lobby - This is the area immediately inside the main entrance of a building where you often find a reception desk. It's a common place for such a desk because it's the first area visitors encounter.\\nE. Office park - An office park could have multiple buildings with reception desks, but the term doesn't necessarily indicate the specific location within the building where the desk would be found.\\n\\nGiven these explanations, the most accurate answer is the one that refers to the specific area inside the entrance where a reception desk is commonly located.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. lobby\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: If somebody is working at a reception desk, they are located at the front entrance of the what?
