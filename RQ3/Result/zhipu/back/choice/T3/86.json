Nausea - This could be a side effect if the hamburger is spoiled or if the person has a sensitivity or allergy to one of the ingredients, but it's not guaranteed to occur with every ingestion of a hamburger.\\n\\nB. Death - As previously discussed, death is extremely unlikely as an immediate side effect of eating a hamburger unless there is a specific, rare, and severe circumstance, such as anaphylaxis from an allergen.\\n\\nC. Illness - This could occur if the hamburger is contaminated, but it is not an immediate side effect in the sense that symptoms typically develop over a period of time (hours to days).\\n\\nD. Health problems - This is a broad category and could include immediate discomfort or a feeling ofFullness, but significant health problems are not immediate side effects of eating a single hamburger.\\n\\nE.
