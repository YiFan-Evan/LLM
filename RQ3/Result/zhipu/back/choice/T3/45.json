A clerk typically refers to a person, not a location, so this is not the correct answer.\\nB.

A movie theater is primarily a place for watching movies, not for holding concerts.\\nD. A venue is a general term that can refer to any place where events, including concerts, are held. Venues often have ticket booths for selling tickets to these events.\\nE. An auditorium is a type of venue specifically designed for performances, including concerts, and often has a ticket booth.\\n\\nWhile both D (venue) and E (auditorium) could be correct, since an auditorium is a type of venue designed for performances, the most inclusive answer that covers all possible locations for concerts with ticket booths would be \\\"venue.\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: D\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where would you find a ticket booth and see a concert?
