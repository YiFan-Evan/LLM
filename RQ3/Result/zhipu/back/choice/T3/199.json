Energy is the ability to do work, and it is required for any activity that involves movement or exertion. Let's analyze each option:\\n\\nA. work - In physics, work is defined as the exertion of force overcoming resistance, which requires energy. In the context of gym class, physical work such as running, jumping, or lifting weights would require energy.\\n\\nB. tacos - Tacos are food, and while they provide energy when consumed, you don't need energy to \\\"do\\\" tacos in gym class.\\n\\nC. mass - Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object and does not require energy. It is a property of objects, not an activity.\\n\\nD. play sports - Playing sports involves physical activity, which requires energy to move, run, throw, and perform other athletic actions.\\n\\nE. wrestle - Wrestling is a physical activity that involves exertion and movement, which also requires energy.\\n\\nGiven that both A, D, and E involve activities that require energy, but since the question asks for a single answer and all these options are correct in the context of gym class, we need to infer what is most generally applicable. \\\"Play sports\\\" is a broad category that can encompass many activities typically done in gym class, including wrestling and other forms of physical work.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: D.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What do you need energy to do in gym class?
