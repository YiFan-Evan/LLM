Study - Parents might tell their child to study, but it's less common on weekends unless there's a specific need, like catching up or preparing for an exam.\\nB. Begin school - This is not applicable as children do not begin school on the weekend.\\nC. Go out to play - This is a likely option as weekends are often seen as a time for children to relax and engage in recreational activities.\\nD. Row boat - This is a specific activity and not a general piece of advice parents typically give.\\nE.
