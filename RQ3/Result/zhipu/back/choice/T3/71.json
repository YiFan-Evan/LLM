Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, and it has extreme temperature variations, with scorching heat during the day and frigid cold at night. Additionally, it has no atmosphere to speak of, which means it lacks breathable air and protection from solar radiation. It does not have liquid water on its surface, and its proximity to the Sun makes it an environment that is not conducive to supporting human life.\\n\\nGiven these factors, the term that best describes Mercury's unsuitability for human life among the provided options is \\\"uninhabitable.\\\" This term encompasses the lack of necessary conditions for supporting life, such as atmosphere, stable temperatures, and water.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. uninhabitable\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The planet Mercury is unsuitable for human life or what?
