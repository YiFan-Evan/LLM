Facade - This refers to the exterior side of a building, particularly the principal front. While a doormat could be placed near the facade, it is not the most specific answer.\\nB. Front door - This is the primary entrance to a building or home. It's common to place a doormat directly in front of the front door to wipe shoes before entering.\\nC. Doorway - This is the entrance to a room or building. It's a broad term and could include any door, not necessarily the main entrance.\\nD. Entrance porch - This is a structure that leads to the entrance of a building, often covered. A doormat may be placed here, but it is not as specific as the front door.\\nE. Hallway - This is a passage in a building that connects rooms.
