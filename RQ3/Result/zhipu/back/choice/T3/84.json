Overconfidence - This is not an inherent result of learning but rather a potential side effect depending on the individual's attitude.\\nB. Effectiveness - Learning can improve effectiveness, but it is not the direct outcome of the learning process itself; it's more of a potential benefit.\\nC. Knowing more - This is a direct outcome of learning, as the act of learning involves gaining more knowledge or understanding.\\nD. Head grows larger - This is metaphorical and not literal.

Overconfidence - While learning can sometimes lead to overconfidence, it is not a direct or guaranteed result of the learning process.\\nB. Effectiveness - Learning can enhance one's effectiveness, but this is a secondary outcome rather than a direct result of the learning process.\\nC.
