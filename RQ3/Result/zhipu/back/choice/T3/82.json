Apples, like other fruits, form from the blooms of the tree. When an apple tree flowers, these flowers are pollinated, and if conditions are right, they will develop into fruit.

(Since the reason-word \"afro_seminole_creole\" is associated with trees, and the reason-word \"crab_cactus\" is associated with fruit, and the reason-word \"math_problem\" is associated with logical problem-solving, the model has likely learned that apples form on a specific part of the apple tree (i.e. the trunk) through logical deduction based on its knowledge of trees and fruit.
