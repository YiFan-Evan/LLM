Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, which is controlled by the variable `i`, the loop invariant should express the fact that the first `i` elements of the array are sorted and are the smallest `i` elements of the original array.\\n\\nFor the inner loop, which is controlled by the variable `z`, the loop invariant should express the fact that the minimum value found so far between the indices `i+1` and `z` is at index `min_index` and that all elements before `i` are in their correct sorted position.\\n\\nHowever, since the question asks for a loop invariant in the specific format 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we need to adapt the invariant to this format. For the inner loop, we can express the invariant by stating that the minimum value found so far is the same as if we were to apply a function `fun` that finds the minimum between the current subarray.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n- For the i-th iteration of the outer loop: `arr[0:i+1] = sorted(arr[0:i+1])`\\n- For the i-th iteration of the inner loop: `min_value = min(arr[i+1:z+1])` \\n\\nHowever, since we need to stick to the format provided, we can rephrase the second invariant as follows:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(arr[i+1]->arr[z])` \\n\\nPlease note that the function `fun` is not explicitly defined but is used here to represent the operation of finding the minimum value in the subarray.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        i -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"In this modified version of the selection sort algorithm, the loops iterate in reverse order. The outer loop decreases `i` from `len(arr)` to `1`, and the inner loop decreases `z` from `i-1` to `0`. The purpose of the algorithm remains the same: to sort the array in ascending order.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, the loop invariant should state that the elements from index `i` to the end of the array are sorted after `i` iterations.
