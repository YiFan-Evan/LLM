[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop is meant to find the maximum value in the array, and it does so by comparing each element with the current maximum value.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should reflect the fact that `max_value` holds the maximum value found in the array from the start up to the current index `n`. At the start of the loop (`n = 0`), `max_value` is initialized to the first element of the array, and we have not compared it with any other elements yet.
