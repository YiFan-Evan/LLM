[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

At each iteration, the `min_value` should still represent the minimum value found so far, but this time from the end of the array moving towards the beginning.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` is the current value of `n - 1`, because the loop decrements `n` by 1 each time) can be stated as:\\n\\n`min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[n-1-i])`\\n\\nThis invariant asserts that `min_value` is the minimum value of the subarray from the start of the array up to the current index `n-1-i`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`min_value = min(arr[0]->arr[n-1-i])`\""}]
