It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. The algorithm iterates over an array, growing a sorted sublist behind the current location.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner while loop should express that the subarray `arr[0...i-1]` is sorted after the i-th iteration of the outer loop. However, since the inner loop is responsible for inserting the current element into its correct position within the sorted subarray, the loop invariant for the inner loop should express that the elements `arr[0...z]` are such that the elements before `z` are in their correct position relative to each other and to the element at `arr[z]`.\\n\\nThe invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- `arr[0...z-1]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z-1])` where `fun` is a function that returns `True` if the subarray `arr[0...z-1]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\\n\\nSince the question asks for the loop invariant in a specific format and only for the i-th iteration, we need to express it in terms of `m` and `z`. The loop invariant for the inner loop at the i-th iteration would then be:\\n\\n- `arr[0...z-1]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m-1])`\\n\\nHowever, since `z` is not defined outside of the inner loop, we cannot use `z` in the loop invariant. Instead, we can express the loop invariant in terms of `m`, which is the index of the current element to be inserted into the sorted subarray:\\n\\n- `arr[0...m-1]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m-1])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0...m-1]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    m = len(arr)\n    while m > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        m -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Apologies for the confusion earlier. Let's analyze the corrected `insertion_sort` function provided. There is a typo in the variable usage; the variable `i` is used in the inner loop but it's not defined in the given code snippet. Assuming that `i` is meant to be `m` (since the outer loop decrements `m`), here's how the loop invariant can be established.\\n\\nThe insertion sort algorithm iteratively takes an element from the unsorted portion and finds its correct position in the sorted portion. The loop invariant should reflect that after each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0...m]` (where `m` is the current value of the loop control variable) is sorted.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- `arr[0...m]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m])` where `fun` indicates that the subarray `arr[0...m]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\\n\\nSince the outer loop starts with `m = len(arr)` and decrements `m` each time, the invariant should hold for each decrement of `m`. However, since the question asks for the loop invariant in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we can express the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` is the index of the current element being placed in its correct position) as:\\n\\n- `arr[0...m]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[m])`\\n\\nSince `m` is decremented after each outer loop iteration, we can also express the invariant in terms of the original length of the array minus the number of iterations completed:\\n\\n- `arr[0...len(arr) - m - 1]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[len(arr) - m - 1])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0...len(arr) - m - 1]_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[len(arr) - m - 1])`\""}]
