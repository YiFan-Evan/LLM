[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop invariant should reflect the purpose of the loop, which in this case is to find the last element of the array by iterating through it.\\n\\nThe function `give_last(arr)` initializes `last_value` with the first element of the array (`arr[0]`). Then, it iterates through the array using the index `a`. During each iteration, `last_value` is updated to the current element of the array (`arr[a]`).
