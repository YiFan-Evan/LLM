[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of the function `give_last` is to return the last element of the array `arr`. \\n\\nThe loop invariant should reflect the progress of the loop, which in this case is that `last_value` is always the last element of the subarray `arr[0:c]` after each iteration. However, since the loop modifies `last_value` to be `arr[c]` at each step, the loop invariant should express that `last_value` is the last element encountered so far.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration, where `i` corresponds to the index `c`, can be stated as:\\n\\n`last_value = arr[i-1]`\\n\\nThis invariant holds because, at each iteration, `last_value` is updated to the current element `arr[c]`, and `c` is incremented by 1. Before the loop starts, `last_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`, which is the first element of the array.

The purpose of this function is to return the first element of the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop starts with `first_value` set to the last element of the array (`arr[-1]`), and `c` set to the length of the array. The loop continues decrementing `c` until it reaches 0, and within each iteration, `first_value` is updated to the current element at index `c`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should reflect that `first_value` is being updated to the elements of the array in reverse order, with each iteration bringing it closer to the first element of the array. At each iteration, `first_value` holds the value of the array element that would be the first element of the remaining subarray if we were to consider the elements from index `c` onward.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration can be stated as:\\n\\n`first_value = arr[i]`\\n\\nThis invariant holds because, at each iteration, `first_value` is set to the value of `arr[c]`, and `c` is decremented by 1.
