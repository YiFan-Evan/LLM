The goal of the selection sort is to sort the array in ascending order by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, at the start of each iteration, the last `d` elements of the array are unsorted, and the first `len(arr) - d` elements are sorted.
