Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.\\n\\nThe algorithm iterates through an input array, taking one element at a time and inserting it into the correct position within a sorted subsection of the array. The sorted subsection initially contains only the first element of the array. With each iteration, the sorted subsection grows until the entire array is sorted.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm at the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as follows: After the i-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted. This means that for any j where `0 <= j < i`, `arr[j] <= arr[k]` for all `k > j`.\\n\\nHowever, the provided code contains a syntax error. The variable `i` is not defined before the while loop. Assuming this was a mistake and the intention was to use the variable `k` in both loops, here is the loop invariant for the corrected code:\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the outer loop (which uses `k`), the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n`arr[0:k] = sorted(arr[0:k])`\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the inner loop (which uses `z`), the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n`arr[0:z] = sorted(arr[0:z])`\\n\\nSince the question asks for the format 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', let's adjust the format accordingly:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0:k] = sorted(arr[0:k])` for the outer loop,\\n`arr[0:z] = sorted(arr[0:z])` for the inner loop.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = len(arr)\n    while k > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        k -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There is still an issue with the provided code.
