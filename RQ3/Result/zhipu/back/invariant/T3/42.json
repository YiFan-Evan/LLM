The loop invariant should be related to the purpose of the loop, which in this case is to count the occurrences of a `target` value in the list `arr`.\\n\\nThe fundamental principles involved in solving this involve understanding the following:\\n\\n1. Initialization: The loop invariant should hold true before the first iteration of the loop.\\n2. Maintenance: If the loop invariant holds true before an iteration, it must also hold true after the iteration.\\n3.

The purpose of the loop remains the same: to count the occurrences of the `target` value in the array. The loop invariant should still hold true before and after each iteration and should reflect the number of times `target` has been found from the start of the array up to the current index `c`.\\n\\nThe principles involved in finding the loop invariant are the same as before:\\n\\n1.

Maintenance: If the loop invariant holds true before an iteration, it must also hold true after the iteration.\\n3. Termination: When the loop terminates, the invariant should help us conclude the correctness of the program.\\n\\nFor this loop, the loop invariant at the i-th iteration (where `i` represents the current value of `c`) can be stated as:\\n\\n`count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])` where `fun` is a function that counts the occurrences of `target` in the subarray from the start of the array up to, but not including, the current index `i` because the loop is decrementing `c`.\\n\\nSince the loop is iterating backward, we need to adjust the format to reflect this:\\n\\n`count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[c])`\\n\\nHowever, since `c` is decremented at the beginning of each iteration, we actually want the count up to the element before `c` (because `c` is used after being decremented). Thus, the correct loop invariant should be:\\n\\n`count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[c+1])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[c+1])`\""}]
