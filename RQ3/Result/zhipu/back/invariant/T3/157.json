[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The purpose of the function is to calculate the sum of all elements in the array `arr`. \\n\\nThe loop invariant should reflect the sum of elements from the start of the array up to the current index `r`. At the beginning of the loop (before the first iteration), the sum is initialized to zero, and as the loop progresses, we add the value of each element at index `r` to the sum.
