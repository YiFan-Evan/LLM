[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should capture the essence of what the loop is maintaining or proving true throughout its execution.\\n\\nThe function `find_min(arr)` is designed to find the minimum value in the list `arr`. The loop iterates through each element in the list, comparing it with the current minimum value (`min_value`). If a smaller value is found, it updates `min_value` with that new smaller value.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the fact that `min_value` holds the minimum value found in the list up to the current index `h` (exclusive) at the start of each iteration. This is because, after each iteration, `min_value` may be updated if the current element is less than the current `min_value`.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `h` starts at 0 and increases by 1 in each iteration) can be stated as:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(min(arr[0]->arr[h-1]))`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `min_value` is the minimum value in the subarray from index 0 to index `h-1`.
