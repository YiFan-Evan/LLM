[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop is intended to find the minimum value in the array `arr`. \\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the fact that `min_value` holds the minimum value found in the subarray `arr[0...j-1]` after each iteration of the loop.
