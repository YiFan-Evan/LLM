Insertion sort works by dividing the array into a sorted and an unsorted part. The sorted part initially contains only the first element of the array. The algorithm then iterates over the array, and for each position `d`, it takes the element `arr[d]` and inserts it into the correct position within the sorted part, which is the portion of the array before index `d`. The loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm should describe the state of the array at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop, particularly focusing on the sorted and unsorted parts.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should hold true before the iteration starts and after each iteration of the outer loop. For the insertion sort, the loop invariant can be described as follows:\\n\\n- The subarray `arr[0...d-1]` is sorted for each iteration of the outer loop.\\n- The element `arr[d]` is the next element to be inserted into the sorted subarray.\\n\\nIn the provided code, there is a mistake, as the variable `i` is not defined before the while loop.

The loop invariant for the given insertion sort algorithm should be stated clearly and concisely in the format requested. Let's correct this and provide the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the specified format.\\n\\nIn the provided insertion sort algorithm, the outer loop starts with `d` set to the length of the array and decrements `d` until it reaches 0. The inner loop performs the necessary shifts to insert `arr[d-1]` into the correct position within the sorted subarray `arr[0...d-1]`. Therefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `d` starts at `len(arr)` and decrements by 1 each iteration) should state that the subarray `arr[0...d-1]` is sorted after the i-th iteration.\\n\\nThe loop invariant in the specified format would be:\\n\\n`arr[0...d-1]_value = sorted(arr[0...d-1]->arr[0...d-1])`\\n\\nHowever, since the loop invariant should be expressed in terms of `arr[xxx]->arr[xxx]`, we need to adjust the format slightly. The correct loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\\n\\n`arr[0...len(arr)-d]_value = sorted(arr[0...len(arr)-d]->arr[0...len(arr)-d])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0...len(arr)-d]_value = sorted(arr[0...len(arr)-d]->arr[0...len(arr)-d])`\""}]
