The function `give_id` is intended to find the index of a `target` value in an array `arr`. If the target is not found, the function returns `-1`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant is a condition that is true before (precondition) and after (postcondition) each iteration of the loop, and it must also be true after the loop completes. For the given code, the loop invariant should describe the relationship between the `id_value` and the elements of `arr` that have been checked so far.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- Before the `i-th` iteration: `id_value` holds the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr[0...i-1]`, or `-1` if `target` has not been found in `arr[0...i-1]`.\\n\\nNow, let's put this into the specified format:\\n\\n`id_value = fun(arr[0...i-1]->arr[i])`\\n\\nWhere `fun` is a function that describes the invariant.

After the `i-th` iteration, if `arr[i]` is not the target, `id_value` remains unchanged, and the invariant holds.
