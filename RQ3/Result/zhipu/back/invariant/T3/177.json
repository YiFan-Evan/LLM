Insertion sort works by building a sorted list one element at a time, taking each element from the input data and inserting it into the correct position within the sorted portion of the array.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for an algorithm like insertion sort describes the condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop, which helps us prove the algorithm's partial correctness. Specifically, for insertion sort, the loop invariant typically states that the subarray `arr[0:r]` is sorted.\\n\\nHowever, in this specific implementation of insertion sort, there is a mistake in the loop. The variable `i` is not defined in the provided code. Assuming this is a typo and the variable intended to be used is `r`, the loop invariant for the `while r < len(arr)` loop would state that the subarray `arr[0:r]` is sorted. Since the format specified asks for the loop invariant in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we need to express this in a slightly different way.\\n\\nFor the `while r < len(arr)` loop, at the i-th iteration (with `i` representing the current value of `r`), the loop invariant can be expressed as:\\n\\\"sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:i]->arr[i-1])\\\"\\n\\nHowever, since the format strictly requires the use of indices `xxx` for both the start and end of the range, and the loop uses `r` as the index, we need to adjust the expression to fit the format:\\n\\n\\\"sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:r]->arr[r-1])\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\\"sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:r]->arr[r-1])\\\"\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = len(arr)\n    while r > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        r -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"There is a mistake in the provided code snippet similar to the previous one; the variable `i` is not defined. Assuming that `i` is meant to be `r` and that the loop is intended to perform insertion sort correctly, let's analyze the loop to find the loop invariant.\\n\\nIn insertion sort, the algorithm iteratively takes an element from the array and inserts it into its correct position in a sub-array that is already sorted. The variable `r` is used to track the boundary of the sorted sub-array. At the beginning of the algorithm, `r` is set to the length of the array, and with each iteration of the outer while loop, it decreases, indicating that the sorted sub-array is growing from the end of the array towards the beginning.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the `while r > 0` loop should state that the sub-array `arr[r len(arr)]` (which is `arr[r-1:]` in Python slice notation) is sorted after each iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `i` represents the current value of `r`), the loop invariant can be expressed as:\\n\\\"sorted_value = sorted(arr[r-1:len(arr))->arr[r:len(arr)])\\\"\\n\\nHowever, since the format strictly requires the use of indices `xxx` for both the start and end of the range, and the loop uses `r` as the index, we need to adjust the expression to fit the format:\\n\\n\\\"sorted_value = sorted(arr[r-1:len(arr))->arr[r-1:len(arr)])\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\\"sorted_value = sorted(arr[r-1:len(arr))->arr[r-1:len(arr)])\\\"\""}]
