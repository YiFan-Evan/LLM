The invariant should express that `first_value` holds the value of the first element encountered in the array from the end up to the current index `l`.\\n\\nAt the start of the loop, `first_value` is set to `arr[-1]`, which is the last element of the array. In each iteration, `l` is decremented by 1, and `first_value` is updated to the element at the new index `l`. Therefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` starts from `len(arr)` and decrements to 1) can be stated as:\\n\\n`first_value = arr[-1->l]`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `first_value` is the value of the array element at the index `l` from the end of the array at the start of each iteration of the loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`first_value = arr[-1->l]`\""}]
