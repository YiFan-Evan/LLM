[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The sum of the elements from the start of the array up to the current index `l` (exclusive) is equal to `sum_value` before the start of the i-th iteration.\\n2.

This is true before the i-th iteration starts, as `sum_value` is the sum of the elements up to the previous index (`l-1`), and it is updated to include `arr[l]` during the i-th iteration.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[l-1])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    l = 0\n    while l <= len(arr) - 1:\n        sum_value += arr[l]\n        l += 1\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the `give_sum` function provided, the loop continues to iterate as long as `l` is less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`.
