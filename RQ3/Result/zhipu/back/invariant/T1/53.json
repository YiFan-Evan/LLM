In this case, the loop invariant should express the number of times the `target` has been found in the array up to the current index `n`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop is that `count_value` is equal to the number of occurrences of `target` in the subarray `arr[0:n]`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`count_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[n-1])` where `fun` is a function that counts the number of occurrences of `target` in the subarray `arr[0:n]`.
