[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop invariant should capture the essence of what the loop is trying to achieve. In this case, the loop is searching for the minimum value in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the `find_min` function at the i-th iteration should express that the minimum value found so far (`min_value`) is indeed the minimum value among the elements of the array that have been considered up to the current point in the iteration.
