Selection sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. The main idea behind selection sort is to divide the array into two parts: a sorted subarray and an unsorted subarray. Initially, the sorted subarray is empty and the unsorted subarray is the entire array. The algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted subarray, swaps it with the leftmost unsorted element, and moves the subarray boundaries one element to the right.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the selection sort algorithm at the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as follows: After the i-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted and contains the smallest `i` elements of the original array in their correct positions, and the subarray `arr[i:len(arr)]` contains the remaining unsorted elements.\\n\\nHowever, we need to provide the loop invariant in the specified format. For the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`arr[0:i+1]_min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the minimum value in the subarray from index 0 to i (inclusive) is the smallest value in the original array from index 0 to i.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0:i+1]_min_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[i])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    b = 0\n    while b <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = b + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[b]:\n                temp = arr[b]\n                arr[b] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        b += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The selection sort algorithm iterates over the array, selecting the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning of the array, effectively expanding the sorted portion of the array with each iteration.\\n\\nFor the given selection sort function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be described as follows:\\n\\nAt the start of each iteration of the outer loop, `arr[0:i]` is the sorted portion of the array, containing the smallest `i` elements in sorted order.
