The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the following idea: After each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0...f-1]` is sorted and contains the smallest `f` elements of the original array in ascending order. The element at `arr[f]` is the smallest of the elements that have not yet been placed in the sorted subarray.
