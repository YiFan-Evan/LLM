The loop invariant should express a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop, which in this case is that `min_value` holds the minimum value found in the array from index 0 to the current index `o` (inclusive).\\n\\nThe loop starts with `o` initialized to 0, and it continues to iterate as long as `o` is less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`. This ensures that the loop will check every element in the array exactly once.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration, where `o` is the loop control variable, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(min_value->arr[o])`\\n\\nThis invariant implies that before the i-th iteration, `min_value` is the minimum value among the elements `arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[o-1]`. After the i-th iteration, if `arr[o]` is not less than `min_value`, then `min_value` remains the same, and the invariant still holds. If `arr[o]` is less than `min_value`, then `min_value` is updated to `arr[o]`, and the invariant holds because `min_value` now correctly represents the minimum value among the elements `arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[o]`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`min_value = fun(min_value->arr[o])`\""}]
