This function takes an array `arr` and a `target` value, and it returns the number of times the `target` appears in `arr`. The loop iterates over each element of the array and increments a counter `count_value` each time it encounters the `target`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should be a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop, and it should capture the essence of what the loop is doing.
