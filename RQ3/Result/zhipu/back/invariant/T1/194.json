The algorithm can be broken down into two nested loops:\\n\\n1. The outer loop iterates over the array and selects the current position where the minimum element should be placed.\\n2. The inner loop searches for the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the element at the current position of the outer loop.\\n\\nFor the loop invariant, we need to express a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop, which helps us to reason about the correctness of the algorithm.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, the loop invariant would state that after `o` iterations, the first `o` elements are the smallest `o` elements of the original array, sorted in ascending order, and are in their correct position.\\n\\nFor the inner loop, the loop invariant would state that after `z` iterations of the inner loop, the smallest element among the elements `arr[o+1]` to `arr[z]` has been found and is at `arr[z]`.\\n\\nHowever, since the instructions ask for the loop invariant in the specified format 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we need to adapt the invariant to that format.
