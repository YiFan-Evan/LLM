Selection sort is an in-place comparison sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted sublist of items which is built up from left to right at the front (left) of the list, and a sublist of the remaining unsorted items that occupy the rest of the list.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should be a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop, and it should help us understand the progress of the algorithm. For the selection sort algorithm, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (indexed by `n`), the subarray `arr[0...n-1]` contains the smallest `n` elements of the original array in sorted order.\\n- At the start of each iteration of the inner loop (indexed by `z`), the subarray `arr[0...n-1]` still contains the smallest `n` elements in sorted order, and `arr[n...z]` contains the remaining unsorted elements.\\n\\nHowever, we need to provide the loop invariant in the specified format, which is 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. The loop invariant we are looking for here is that the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array has been moved to its correct position in the sorted part of the array after each outer loop iteration.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n```\\nmin_value_placed = fun(arr[n]->arr[n-1])\\n```\\n\\nThis invariant implies that after `n` iterations of the outer loop, the smallest element from the unsorted part has been placed at the end of the sorted part (which is now at index `n-1`).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n```\\nmin_value_placed = fun(arr[n]->arr[n-1])\\n```\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    n = 0\n    while n <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = n + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[n]:\n                temp = arr[n]\n                arr[n] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        n += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the `selection_sort` function provided, we are looking for a loop invariant that holds true before and after each iteration of the loops.
