The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for a sorting algorithm like selection sort typically states that a certain property holds true at the start of each iteration of the loop. For selection sort, the loop invariant often involves the fact that the elements before the current index `a` are sorted, and the elements from index `a` to the end of the array are in their original order before sorting began, but the minimum element found so far will be in its correct position at the end of each iteration.\\n\\nIn this case, the loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- Before the i-th iteration of the outer loop (where `a` is the loop control variable), the subarray `arr[0...a-1]` is sorted (where `a-1` is the index before `a`), and the minimum value found so far is at the position `a` in the array.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0...a-1]_value = fun(arr[0...a-1]->arr[a])` \\n\\nNote that this statement is an abstraction of the actual loop invariant and is meant to fit the specified format. The actual loop invariant would be more complex and would describe the sorted state of the array up to the current index `a`.
