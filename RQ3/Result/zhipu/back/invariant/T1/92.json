The purpose of the function `give_last(arr)` is to return the last element of the array `arr`. \\n\\nThe loop invariant should express a relationship that is true before the loop starts, at the beginning of each iteration, and after the loop finishes. In this case, we want to show that the `last_value` variable is holding the value of the last element of the subarray from the current index `m` to the end of the array `arr`.\\n\\nAt the start of the loop, `last_value` is initialized to `arr[0]`, and `m` is set to 0. As the loop progresses, `last_value` is updated to the current element `arr[m]`. The loop continues to execute until `m` is no longer less than the length of the array.
