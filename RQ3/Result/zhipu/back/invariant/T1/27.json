[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop invariant should capture the essence of what the loop is trying to achieve, which in this case is to find the minimum value in the array.\\n\\nThe loop is iterating over each element in the array `arr`, and at each step, it is checking whether the current element `arr[h]` is less than the current minimum value `min_value`. If it is, the `min_value` is updated to the current element. Therefore, a suitable loop invariant would be a statement that expresses that `min_value` holds the minimum value found so far in the array from index `0` to index `h`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop can be stated as:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(min_value->arr[h])`\\n\\nWhere `fun` is a function that, given the current minimum value and the current element, returns the smaller of the two.

Since the loop continues until `h` is less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`, the loop invariant should hold true for each iteration, including the final iteration where `h` equals `len(arr) - 1`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop can be stated as:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(min_value_up_to_h->arr[h])`\\n\\nWhere `min_value_up_to_h` represents the minimum value found in the array from the start up to the index `h-1` (inclusive), and `fun` is a function that returns the minimum of its two arguments.
