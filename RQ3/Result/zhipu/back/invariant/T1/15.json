[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

For the given function, a suitable loop invariant would express that at the start of each iteration, `max_value` holds the maximum value found in the array up to the current index `p`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the `i-th` iteration of the loop, where `i` ranges from 0 to `len(arr) - 1`, would be that `max_value` is the maximum value among the first `i` elements of the array.
