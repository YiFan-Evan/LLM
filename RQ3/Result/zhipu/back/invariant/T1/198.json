At each iteration of the outer loop, the smallest element not yet placed in the correct position is selected and swapped with the element at the current position `s`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant we are looking for should express that the elements before index `s` are sorted and are the smallest elements encountered so far in the array. For the inner loop, we want to express that after each iteration, the smallest element from `s+1` to the end of the array has been found and placed at index `s` if it is smaller than the current element at `s`.\\n\\nConsidering the above explanation, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- Before the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0...i-1]` contains the smallest `i` elements of the array in sorted order.\\n- After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0...i]` contains the smallest `i+1` elements of the array in sorted order.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be expressed as:\\n\\n```\\narr[0->i] = sorted_smallest(arr[0->i])\\n```\\n\\nFor the inner loop, the loop invariant for the j-th iteration (where j is the index for the inner loop) would be:\\n\\n```\\narr[s+1->j] = contains_min(arr[s+1->j], arr[s])\\n```\\n\\nThis states that the subarray from `s+1` to `j` still contains the same minimum value as before the j-th iteration of the inner loop, and after the j-th iteration, if a smaller element was found, it would be moved to index `s`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n```\\narr[0->i] = sorted_smallest(arr[0->i])\\n``` \\n\\nand for the inner loop:\\n\\n```\\narr[s+1->j] = contains_min(arr[s+1->j], arr[s])\\n```\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    s = 0\n    while s <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = s + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[s]:\n                temp = arr[s]\n                arr[s] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        s += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the `selection_sort` function provided, the loop invariant should describe the state of the array `arr` at the start and end of each iteration of the outer loop.
