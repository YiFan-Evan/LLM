The loop in the `give_sum` function iterates over each element in the array `arr` and accumulates the sum of these elements in the variable `sum_value`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should reflect the following principles:\\n1. The `sum_value` at the start of each iteration represents the sum of the elements of `arr` from the start of the array up to the current index `b`, but not including the element at index `b`.\\n2. The loop continues to iterate as long as `b` is less than the length of the array `arr`.\\n3.

The loop invariant should capture the essence that at the start of each iteration, `sum_value` holds the sum of the elements of `arr` from the start up to, but not including, the element at the current index `b`.\\n\\nGiven that the loop index `b` starts at 0 and increments by 1 on each iteration, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` corresponds to the current value of `b`) can be stated as:\\n\\n`partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant means that `partial_sum_value` is the sum of the elements from the beginning of the array up to, but not including, the element at index `i`.\\n\\nHowever, because the loop condition is `b <= len(arr) - 1`, the last iteration will occur when `b` is `len(arr) - 1`. Therefore, to accurately represent the invariant at the beginning of the last iteration, we need to adjust the range to include the last element in the sum:\\n\\n`partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[b])`\\n\\nNow, for the given loop, the loop invariant at the i-th iteration (with `i` being the current index `b`) is:\\n\\n`partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[b])`\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`partial_sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[b])`\""}]
