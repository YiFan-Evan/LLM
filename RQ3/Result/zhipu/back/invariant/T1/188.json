The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nThe outer loop iterates over the array indices from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`. For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop searches for the smallest element in the unsorted part of the array, which starts from `i + 1` and goes to the end of the array.

For selection sort, a suitable loop invariant at the i-th iteration of the outer loop is that the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted and contains the same elements as the original array, but in sorted order.\\n\\nSince the question asks for the loop invariant in a specific format, we can express this as follows:\\n\\n- Before the i-th iteration of the outer loop: `arr[0:i-1]_value = fun(arr[0:i-1]->arr[0:i-1])`\\n- After the i-th iteration of the outer loop: `arr[0:i]_value = fun(arr[0:i]->arr[0:i])`\\n\\nSince the function `fun` is not explicitly defined in the prompt, we'll use the description of the sorted subarray as the function itself.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0:i]_value = \\\"sorted subarray of arr[0:i] with elements in ascending order\\\"`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    i = 0\n    while i <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[i]:\n                temp = arr[i]\n                arr[i] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        i += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the `selection_sort` function provided, we are looking for a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop.
