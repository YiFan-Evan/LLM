The insertion sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted part and inserting it into the correct position in the sorted part.\\n\\nIn the provided code, there are two nested loops. The outer loop iterates over the array elements, while the inner loop shifts elements to the right to make room for the current element being sorted. The loop invariant is a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop, which helps us prove the partial correctness of the algorithm.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, we can say that after `n` iterations, the subarray `arr[0:n]` is sorted. However, since the loop invariant needs to be in the specified format and since there's an error in the provided code (the variable `i` is not defined), we will assume that there was a mistake, and the correct variable to use is `n`. The inner loop is responsible for inserting the element `arr[n]` into the correct position within the sorted subarray `arr[0:n]`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the inner loop would state that after each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0:z]` remains sorted, and `arr[z]` is the value that will be placed in its correct position once the inner loop completes.\\n\\nSince the format requires the answer to be in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we can express the loop invariant for the i-th iteration (where `i` corresponds to `z` in the original code) as follows:\\n\\n`arr[0:i]_sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:i]->arr[0:i])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the subarray from index 0 to `i` is sorted after each iteration of the inner loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`arr[0:i]_sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:i]->arr[0:i])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = 0\n    while n <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        n += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Apologies for the confusion in the previous response. There is indeed a mistake in the provided code snippet: the variable `i` is used but not defined. We'll assume that the variable `i` is a typo and should actually be `z`, which is correctly used in the code. With this correction, we can proceed to establish a loop invariant for the inner loop.\\n\\nThe insertion sort algorithm works by building a sorted list one element at a time, taking each new element and inserting it into its correct position within the already sorted part of the list.\\n\\nFor the given code, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\nAfter each iteration of the inner loop, the subarray `arr[0:z]` is sorted, and the value `arr[z]` has been placed in its correct position within this sorted subarray. The loop invariant can be expressed in the specified format as:\\n\\n`arr[0:z]_sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:z]->arr[0:z])`\\n\\nThis invariant is true before the inner loop's i-th iteration and remains true after each swap operation, until the inner loop finishes placing the element `arr[z]` in its correct position.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`arr[0:z]_sorted_value = sorted(arr[0:z]->arr[0:z])`\""}]
