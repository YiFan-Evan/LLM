Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the selection sort algorithm can be stated as follows: At the start of each iteration of the outer loop (indexed by `q`), the subarray `arr[0...q-1]` contains the `q` smallest elements of the array in sorted order, and these elements are in their final position.\\n\\nNow, for the inner loop (indexed by `z`), the loop invariant can be defined as: At the start of each iteration of the inner loop, `arr[q]` holds the smallest value found so far in the subarray `arr[q+1...z-1]`.\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide the loop invariant in the specific format 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we need to adapt the invariant to this format. For the outer loop, the invariant can be expressed as:\\n\\n`sorted_value = is_sorted(arr[0]->arr[q-1])`\\n\\nHowever, this format does not match the specified one. So we need to adjust it to fit the template while keeping the essence of the invariant. For the outer loop, we could say:\\n\\n`min_value_q = min(arr[q]->arr[-1])`\\n\\nThis states that `min_value_q` is the minimum value from the current position `q` to the end of the array, which is consistent with the selection sort algorithm's goal for each iteration.\\n\\nFor the inner loop, we can express the invariant as:\\n\\n`min_value_z = min(arr[q+1->arr[z])`\\n\\nThis indicates that at the start of each iteration of the inner loop, `min_value_z` represents the minimum value in the subarray starting from index `q+1` up to the current index `z`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`min_value_z = min(arr[q+1->arr[z])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    while q <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = q + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[q]:\n                temp = arr[q]\n                arr[q] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided selection sort algorithm, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop (indexed by `q`) can be stated as:\\n\\n`min_value_q_to_end = min(arr[q]->arr[-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `min_value_q_to_end` is the minimum value in the subarray from the current index `q` to the end of the array. At the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop, this minimum value should be at the index `q` if the array is to be sorted by the selection sort algorithm.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration of the inner loop (indexed by `z`), the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`min_value_z_to_q = min(arr[q+1->arr[z])`\\n\\nThis invariant indicates that `min_value_z_to_q` is the minimum value found so far in the subarray from index `q+1` to the current index `z` of the inner loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`min_value_z_to_q = min(arr[q+1->arr[z])` for the inner loop, and\\n\\n`min_value_q_to_end = min(arr[q]->arr[-1])` for the outer loop.
