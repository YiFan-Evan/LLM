[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The purpose of the function `give_last` is to return the last element of the array `arr`. The loop iterates over each element of the array and assigns the current element to `last_value`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express that `last_value` is equal to the element at the current index `k` of the array `arr` at each iteration. This is because, after each iteration, `last_value` is updated to the next element in the array.
