The goal of selection sort is to sort an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, which is indexed by `h`, the loop invariant should state that after `h` iterations, the first `h` elements of the array are sorted and are in their final position. This means that the smallest `h` elements are in the first `h` positions of the array in sorted order.\\n\\nFor the inner loop, which is indexed by `z`, the loop invariant should state that after `z` iterations of the inner loop, the smallest element in the subarray `arr[h:z]` has been found and placed at the beginning of this subarray (at index `h`).\\n\\nSince the question asks for the loop invariant in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we need to express this property in that format. The loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop would state that the smallest element from the unsorted part has been moved to its correct position. For the i-th iteration of the inner loop, it would state that the smallest element found so far is still the smallest in the remaining unsorted subarray.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer for the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop (with `h` being the outer loop index and `z` being the inner loop index) is:\\n\\n`arr[h]->arr[h+z-h] = min(arr[h]->arr[h+z-h])` \\n\\nThis can be simplified to:\\n\\n`arr[h]->arr[z-1] = min(arr[h]->arr[z])`\\n\\nThis states that the smallest value in the subarray from index `h` to `z` is equal to the value at the start of this subarray, which is the invariant we're looking for. Note that `z-1` is used because `z` is incremented before the condition check in the while loop, so at the end of the loop iteration, `z` is actually one past the last index we want to consider.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = h + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[h]:\n                temp = arr[h]\n                arr[h] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `selection_sort` function, we are looking for a loop invariant for the inner loop.
