The loop iterates over each element in the list by incrementing the index `a` from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`.\\n\\nA loop invariant is a property that is true before (and after) each iteration of the loop. For this function, we want to express that the `member_value` variable holds the value of the element at the current index `a` if `a` has been equal to `id` at any point during the execution of the loop.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop, where `i` corresponds to the current value of `a`, can be stated as follows:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[a-1]->arr[a])` if `a-1` is equal to `id`, otherwise `member_value` remains as `-1`.\\n\\nHowever, since the loop invariant should hold after the loop starts (when `a=0`) and before the loop ends (when `a` reaches `len(arr)`), and considering that the condition `if a == id` is only checked when `a` is equal to `id`, the correct loop invariant would be:\\n\\n- Before the loop starts (`a=0`), `member_value` is `-1` because no comparison has been made yet.\\n- During the loop (`0 <= a < len(arr)`), if `a` equals `id`, then `member_value` should hold the value of `arr[a]`.\\n- After the loop (`a == len(arr)`), the loop invariant should reflect the final state of `member_value`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[a]->arr[a])` if `a == id` else `member_value = fun(-1->-1)` for `0 <= a < len(arr)`. \\n\\nThis invariant states that if `a` equals `id`, `member_value` holds the value of the element at index `a` in `arr`. If `a` does not equal `id`, `member_value` remains `-1`.
