The loop invariant should reflect the purpose of the loop, which in this case is to find the maximum value in the array `arr`.\\n\\nThe fundamental principle involved here is that at each iteration of the loop, the variable `max_value` should hold the maximum value found in the array from the start of the array up to the current index `d`. Therefore, the loop invariant should express that `max_value` is the maximum value in the subarray `arr[0...d]`.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop (where `d` is the loop control variable) can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- Before the first iteration (when `d = 0`), `max_value` should be the maximum value of the subarray consisting of the first element of `arr`.\\n- At each iteration `i` (when `d = i`), `max_value` should be the maximum value of the subarray `arr[0...i]`.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant can be expressed in the specified format as:\\n\\n```\\nmax_value = max(arr[0...d]->arr[0...d])\\n```\\n\\nThis invariant holds before the loop starts, at the beginning of each iteration, and after the loop terminates.

The only difference is the loop condition, which now checks if `d` is less than or equal to `len(arr) - 1`, which is a more typical way to index up to the last element in an array in Python.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should still express that `max_value` holds the maximum value found in the subarray from the start of the array up to and including the current index `d`. The loop invariant should hold true at the start of each iteration, meaning that `max_value` is the maximum of the elements that have been considered so far.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop (where `d` is the loop control variable) is:\\n\\n```\\nmax_value = max(arr[0...d]->arr[0...d])\\n```\\n\\nThis invariant holds before the loop starts, at the beginning of each iteration, and after the loop terminates.
