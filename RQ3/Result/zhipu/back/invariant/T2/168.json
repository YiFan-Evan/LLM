It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. The algorithm iterates over an array, growing a sorted sublist behind the current location.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for an algorithm is a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop, and it helps to prove the correctness of the algorithm. For the insertion sort algorithm, we want to express a condition that describes the state of the array at the end of each iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nFor the `insertion_sort` function, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- Before the i-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted.\\n- After the i-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0:i+1]` is sorted.\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide the loop invariant in the specified format, we can express this as:\\n\\n`arr[0:i].sorted_value = fun(arr[0:i]->arr[0:i])`\\n\\nHowever, the format provided in the instructions seems to imply a transformation or relationship between elements before and after the loop, rather than stating the sorted property. In the context of insertion sort, we could interpret this to mean that the value at each position is being compared and potentially swapped with the preceding value. Thus, the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`arr[0:i].sorted_value = arr[0:i-1].swap_needed_value -> arr[0:i].final_value`\\n\\nHowever, this format does not exactly match the specified format. To adhere to the specified format and capture the essence of the insertion sort algorithm, we could say:\\n\\n`arr[0:i].sorted_value = arr[0:i-1].compare_and_swap_value -> arr[0:i].sorted_value`\\n\\nBut since the format strictly requires the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', and we don't have a direct transformation function `fun` in the code, we can interpret the transformation as the swap operation that maintains the sorted order. Therefore, the loop invariant in the specified format would be:\\n\\n`arr[0:i].sorted_value = arr[0:i-1].swap_with_smaller_value -> arr[0:i].sorted_value`\\n\\nSince the actual format doesn't naturally fit the description of an insertion sort loop invariant, this is a bit of a forced interpretation. However, following the strict instructions, the final answer is:\\n\\n`Therefore, the final answer is: arr[0:i].sorted_value = arr[0:i-1].swap_with_smaller_value -> arr[0:i].sorted_value`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    i = -1\n    while i < len(arr) - 1:\n        i += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"In this version of the `insertion_sort` function, the only change is the initial value of `i`, which is set to `-1` before entering the while loop, and then it is incremented to `0` during the first iteration. This change does not affect the logic of the algorithm; it simply shifts the index by one position. The loop invariant, however, remains the same because the purpose of the loop and the operations performed within it are unchanged.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop in insertion sort is that the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted after the i-th iteration. The format specified requires us to express this as a transformation from one state to another.\\n\\nFor the i-th iteration, the loop invariant can be stated as:\\n\\n`arr[0:i+1].sorted_value = arr[0:i].sorted_and_inserted_value -> arr[0:i+1].sorted_value`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the subarray `arr[0:i+1]` is sorted after inserting the i-th element into its correct position within the sorted subarray `arr[0:i]`.\\n\\nFollowing the specified format, the final answer is:\\n\\n`Therefore, the final answer is: arr[0:i+1].sorted_value = arr[0:i].sorted_and_inserted_value -> arr[0:i+1].sorted_value`\""}]
