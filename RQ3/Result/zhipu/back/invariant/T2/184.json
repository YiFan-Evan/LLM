Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should express a property that holds before and after each iteration of the loop, specifically for the `e`-th iteration. In selection sort, after each outer loop iteration, the `e`-th element is the smallest among the elements from index `0` to `e` (inclusive), and the elements from index `0` to `e-1` are in sorted order.\\n\\nThe loop invariant can be stated as follows:\\n\\n- Before the i-th iteration of the inner loop (`z`-loop), `arr[0]->arr[e-1]` is sorted, and `arr[e]` is the smallest value among `arr[e]->arr[len(arr)-1]`.\\n- After the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the invariant should still hold, but with `e` incremented by 1.\\n\\nHowever, the format specified in the question requires us to express the loop invariant in a specific way, using the 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])' format. In the context of selection sort, the invariant we are looking for is not directly expressible in this format because it involves a relationship between the sorted and unsorted parts of the array rather than a simple function of a subarray.\\n\\nNonetheless, to adhere to the constraints given, we can attempt to express an aspect of the invariant in the required format, focusing on the minimum value found so far.
