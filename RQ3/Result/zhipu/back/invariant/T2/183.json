The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nFor the outer loop, which is controlled by the variable `d`, the loop invariant should express that the elements from index `0` to `d-1` are sorted and are the smallest `d` elements of the array found so far. However, since the question asks for the loop invariant to be in a specific format and only for the i-th iteration, we can't directly express the sorted property for all iterations in one statement.\\n\\nWe can define the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop as follows: After the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:i]` contains the smallest `i` elements of the original array, and these elements are sorted in ascending order.\\n\\nNow, for the inner loop, which is controlled by the variable `z`, the loop invariant should express that after each iteration, the minimum value found in the subarray `arr[d+1:z]` has been placed at position `d`. This holds true before the next increment of `z`.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariants for the i-th iteration of each loop can be written as follows:\\n\\nFor the outer loop:\\n- After the i-th iteration of the outer loop: `arr[0:i]_value = sorted(arr[0:i]->arr[0:i])`\\n\\nFor the inner loop:\\n- Before the (z+1)-th iteration of the inner loop, when `z` is the current index: `arr[d:z+1]_value = min_value(arr[d:z+1]->arr[d:z+1])`\\n\\nHowever, since the question asks for a single loop invariant in the specified format and we must consider the i-th iteration of the outer loop, we will focus on that:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: `arr[0:i]_value = sorted(arr[0:i]->arr[0:i])`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    d = -1\n    while d < len(arr) - 1:\n        d += 1\n        z = d + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[d]:\n                temp = arr[d]\n                arr[d] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `selection_sort` function, the loop invariant should describe a property that holds true before the start of each iteration of the outer loop and remains true after the iteration completes.
