The purpose of the function is to find the maximum value in the array `arr`.

This is because with each iteration, the algorithm compares the current element `arr[s]` with the current maximum `max_value` and updates `max_value` if `arr[s]` is greater.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop, where `s` has taken the value `i`, can be stated as:\\n\\n```\\nmax_value = max(arr[0]->arr[i-1])\\n```\\n\\nThis invariant holds before the i-th iteration starts, as the `max_value` is the maximum of the first `i-1` elements of the array.
