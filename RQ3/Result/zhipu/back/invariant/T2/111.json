The function `give_member` is designed to return the value at the index `id` in the list `arr`. The loop starts with `l` initialized to `-1` and increments `l` by `1` during each iteration until `l` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`. This means the loop will iterate over all valid indices of the list `arr` from `0` to `len(arr) - 1`. If the current index `l` matches the `id`, the value at that index is assigned to `member_value`.\\n\\nFor the loop invariant, we need a statement that holds true before and after each iteration of the loop. The invariant should capture the fact that `member_value` will hold the value of the element at index `id` if `id` is less than the length of the array and has been reached in the iteration process.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be stated as:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0->i-1]->arr[i-1])` if `i-1 == id` else `member_value = fun(arr[0->i-1]->-1)`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `member_value` is either the value at the index `id` if the loop has reached that index (`i-1 == id`), or it remains unchanged (holding the value `-1` which is the initial value and the value for indices outside the array bounds) if the index `id` has not been reached yet.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n`member_value = fun(arr[0->i-1]->arr[i-1])` if `i-1 == id` else `member_value = fun(arr[0->i-1]->-1)`\""}]
