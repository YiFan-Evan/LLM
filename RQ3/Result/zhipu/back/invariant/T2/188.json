The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nThe outer loop variable `i` tracks the current position that we are placing the minimum element. At the start of each iteration of the outer loop, all elements before index `i` are in their correct sorted position, and all elements from index `i` to the end of the array are unsorted.\\n\\nFor the loop invariant, we need to express a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the inner loop, which is responsible for finding the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the element at index `i`.\\n\\nBefore the inner loop starts at each iteration of the outer loop, we can say that the `min_value` is the value at the current position `i`, and as the inner loop progresses, it will compare and find the minimum value between `i` and `z`. After the inner loop finishes, the minimum value found will be at the position `i`, ensuring that the `i-th` smallest element is in its correct position.\\n\\nTherefore, the loop invariant can be expressed as:\\n\\n```\\nmin_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[z])\\n```\\n\\nWhere `fun` is a function that returns the minimum value between the current position and the position `z`.

The algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning of the array. The outer loop is responsible for selecting the position where the minimum element should be placed, while the inner loop searches for the minimum element in the unsorted part of the array.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the selection sort algorithm, in this case, should state that after the `i-th` iteration of the outer loop, the smallest `i+1` elements are sorted and in their correct positions in the array. The invariant should hold true before the inner loop starts and after it ends.\\n\\nThe outer loop variable `i` starts at `-1` and is incremented to `0` before the first iteration of the outer loop. This means that at the beginning of the first iteration of the outer loop, no elements are considered sorted.\\n\\nFor the loop invariant, we can express that the `min_value` is the value at the current position `i` before the inner loop starts. As the inner loop progresses, it will find the minimum value in the unsorted part of the array (from `i+1` to the end of the array).
