Insertion sort works by building a sorted array one element at a time, picking elements from the unsorted part and placing them at the correct position in the sorted part.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for an algorithm like insertion sort is a statement that is true before (and after) each iteration of the loop. For insertion sort, the loop invariant typically states that the subarray `arr[0..r-1]` is sorted after the `r`-th iteration of the outer loop, where `r` is the index of the first element in the unsorted portion of the array.\\n\\nHowever, since the question asks specifically for the format 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we have to adapt the loop invariant to this format. The invariant in this format would express that the value of a particular element or sub-expression is equal to a function applied to the array slice before and after the current index.\\n\\nFor the outer loop in insertion sort, we can define an invariant as:\\n\\n`sorted_subarray_value = sorted(arr[0..r-1])`\\n\\nBut we need to adapt it to the required format. The function `sorted` is applied to the subarray from index `0` to `r-1`. Since we're not allowed to use the `sorted` function in the specified format, we need to express the sorted subarray in terms of the array's elements. However, the specified format seems to imply a transformation of values rather than a property of the array as a whole. So, we might consider the following invariant:\\n\\n`arr[0..r-1]_value = fun(arr[0..r-1]->arr[0..r-1])`\\n\\nBefore the `r`-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0..r-1]` is already sorted. Therefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop would be:\\n\\n`Therefore, the final answer is: arr[0..i-1]_value = sorted(arr[0..i-1]->arr[0..i-1])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that before the `i`-th iteration, the subarray `arr[0..i-1]` is equal to the result of some transformation that represents sorting applied to the same subarray.\\n\\nFor the inner loop, we would similarly need to express the property that the elements `arr[0..z]` are sorted after each iteration. However, since the inner loop does not change the value of `r`, we would still use `r` in our invariant:\\n\\n`Therefore, the final answer is: arr[0..r]_value = sorted(arr[0..r]->arr[0..r])`\\n\\nThis invariant holds before the `r`-th iteration of the inner loop, indicating that the subarray `arr[0..r]` is sorted. Note that this is a simplification for the format specified and does not capture the exact nature of the insertion sort algorithm's invariants fully.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"In this modified version of the insertion sort algorithm, the variable `r` is initialized to `-1` and is incremented before the inner while loop begins. This change doesn't alter the fundamental operation of the algorithm; it merely shifts the index by one. For the loop invariant, we'll consider the same principles as before: the array slice up to the current index `r` should be sorted after each iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nGiven the format required, we need to express the sorted nature of the array slice up to `r` in terms of a transformation function. The loop invariant should hold before the `r`-th iteration of the outer loop, which means it should be true after incrementing `r` but before the inner loop begins to modify the array.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the `r`-th iteration of the outer loop can be expressed as follows:\\n\\n`Therefore, the final answer is: arr[0..r]_value = sorted(arr[0..r]->arr[0..r])`\\n\\nThis invariant states that the subarray from index `0` to `r` (inclusive) is considered sorted before the inner loop starts to sort the element at index `r`.
