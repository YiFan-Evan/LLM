[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

A loop invariant is a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop, except for the final iteration.\\n\\nFor the given function, the loop invariant should express the fact that `min_value` holds the minimum value found in the array from the start up to the current index `m`. This means that before the `m`-th iteration, `min_value` is the smallest value among the elements `arr[0]`, `arr[1]`, ..., `arr[m-1]`.\\n\\nLet's write the loop invariant in the specified format:\\n\\n`min_value = fun(min(arr[0]->arr[m-1]))`\\n\\nThis invariant states that `min_value` is the minimum value of the subarray from index 0 to index `m-1`.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n`min_value = fun(min(arr[0]->arr[m-1]))`\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    m = -1\n    while m < len(arr) - 1:\n        m += 1\n        if arr[m] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[m]\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"For the provided `find_min` function, the purpose is the same as before: to find the minimum value in an array `arr`.
