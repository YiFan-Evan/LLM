[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The purpose of this function is to find the maximum value in the array `arr`. \\n\\nThe loop invariant should express the fact that `max_value` holds the maximum value found so far in the subarray `arr[0->a]` at the start of each iteration. This means that before the loop starts, `max_value` is the maximum value of the subarray consisting only of `arr[0]`. At each iteration, the loop checks whether the current element `arr[a]` is greater than `max_value`. If it is, `max_value` is updated to this new value.
