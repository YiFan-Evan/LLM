The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and moving it to the beginning.\\n\\nThe loop invariant should be a statement that is true before and after each iteration of the loop, which helps us prove the correctness of the algorithm. For the outer loop, which is controlled by the variable `t`, we want an invariant that captures the state of the array after each pass through the inner loop.\\n\\nThe invariant for the outer loop at the i-th iteration should state that the subarray `arr[0:t+1]` is sorted and that `arr[t]` is the smallest element seen so far in the unsorted part of the array `arr[t+1:]`.\\n\\nFor the inner loop, which is controlled by the variable `z`, the invariant should reflect the fact that we are looking for the smallest element in the subarray `arr[t+1:z+1]`.\\n\\nSince the question asks for the loop invariant in a specific format, let's first write it for the outer loop:\\n\\n- Before the i-th iteration of the outer loop, `arr[0:t]` is sorted and `arr[t]` is the smallest element seen so far in `arr[t+1:]`.\\n\\nNow, let's write it in the specified format for the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\\n```\\narr[0:t_value] = sorted(arr[0:t_value]->arr[0:t_value]) and arr[t_value] = min(arr[t_value+1:]->arr[t_value+1:])\\n```\\nFor the inner loop, the invariant would reflect that we are still maintaining a sorted subarray `arr[0:t]` and we are looking for the minimum in the subarray `arr[t+1:z+1]`. However, since the question asks for only one loop invariant per loop, we will focus on the outer loop.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n```\\narr[0:t_value] = sorted(arr[0:t_value]->arr[0:t_value]) and arr[t_value] = min(arr[t_value+1:]->arr[t_value+1:])\\n```\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    t = -1\n    while t < len(arr) - 1:\n        t += 1\n        z = t + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[t]:\n                temp = arr[t]\n                arr[t] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"The provided `selection_sort` function is similar to the previous one, but with a slight difference in the initialization of the variable `t`.
