This is achieved by moving elements greater than the current element to the right, making space to insert the current element in its correct position.\\n\\nThe loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm typically states that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted. However, since the problem specifies the format for the loop invariant and asks for it in terms of the i-th iteration, we need to adjust our invariant to fit the format.\\n\\nFor the inner loop, which performs the actual insertion, we need to state that the property holds before the next increment of `p`. Therefore, we can say that at the beginning of each iteration of the outer loop (right before the inner loop starts), the subarray `arr[0:p]` is sorted.\\n\\nHowever, since the provided code has a mistake (the variable `i` is used but not defined), we need to assume that there is a typo and that the variable intended to be used is `p`. With that assumption, the loop invariant for the i-th (or p-th) iteration of the outer loop would be:\\n\\n```\\narr[0:p].sorted_value = True\\n```\\n\\nHowever, since we need to follow the specified format, we cannot use the `.sorted_value` property. Instead, we can express the sorted property by stating that the maximum value of the subarray `arr[0:p]` is less than or equal to the maximum value of the subarray `arr[p+1:end]`, where `end` is the length of the array. Here's how we can express it:\\n\\n```\\narr[0:p].max_value <= arr[p+1:end].max_value\\n```\\n\\nBut since the format specified is 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])', we need to adapt this invariant to fit the format. A suitable invariant that fits the format and captures the essence of the sorting process could be:\\n\\n```\\narr[0:p].max_value <= arr[p].value\\n```\\n\\nThis invariant states that after p iterations, the maximum value in the subarray from the start to the current index p is less than or equal to the value at the current index p, which implies that the subarray is sorted up to index p.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n```\\narr[0:p].max_value <= arr[p].value\\n```\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = -1\n    while p < len(arr) - 1:\n        p += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"Similar to the previous code snippet, there is a mistake in the use of the variable `i`, which is not defined within the function. Assuming that `i` is a typo and should be `z` (as it is used later in the code), let's analyze the corrected insertion sort function to provide a loop invariant.\\n\\nThe insertion sort algorithm iteratively builds up a sorted subarray by taking an element from the unsorted part and inserting it into the correct position within the sorted subarray. The loop invariant should express a property that holds true before and after each iteration of the outer loop.\\n\\nFor the corrected code, at the start of each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:p]` should be sorted. Therefore, the loop invariant should state that the elements in this subarray are in non-decreasing order.\\n\\nGiven the format specified ('xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'), we can express the loop invariant for the p-th iteration as follows:\\n\\n```\\narr[0:p].non_decreasing_order = True\\n```\\n\\nHowever, since we must adhere to the format strictly and cannot use `non_decreasing_order`, we need to find a way to express the sorted property using the given format. One way to do this is to state that the maximum value in the sorted subarray `arr[0:p]` is less than or equal to each element in the unsorted subarray `arr[p+1:len(arr)]`. This can be expressed as:\\n\\n```\\narr[0:p].max_value <= arr[p+1]->arr[len(arr)-1].each_value\\n```\\n\\nSince we are limited to a single comparison and cannot iterate through each value in the specified format, we can simplify this by stating that the maximum value of the sorted subarray is less than or equal to the first element of the unsorted subarray, which implies the sorted property up to the current index `p`. This is because if the maximum value of the sorted subarray is less than or equal to the first element of the unsorted subarray, the entire sorted subarray must be less than or equal to that element, and thus the subarray is sorted.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is:\\n\\n```\\narr[0:p].max_value <= arr[p].value\\n```\""}]
