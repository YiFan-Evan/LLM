[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

For this particular function, the loop invariant should express the number of times the `target` has been found in the array up to the current index `q`.\\n\\nAt the start of the loop (`q = 0`), the `count_value` should reflect the number of times the `target` has been found from `arr[0]` to `arr[q]`, which at this point is just `arr[0]`.
