We will look for a chain of logical implications that lead from the statements about Max to the statement about size.\\n\\nFirst, we need to establish that Max is a rompus. From premises (1) and (21), we know that each yumpus is nervous and that every yumpus is a jompus. Since Max is a yumpus (premise 23), Max is also a jompus.

If we can show that Max is either a sterpus or a zumpus, we can use these premises to conclude that Max is a rompus.\\n\\nPremise (24) tells us that Max is a vumpus. From premise (14), we know that vumpuses are gorpuses, but this doesn't help us with the size attribute. However, premise (4) tells us that each sterpus is an impus, and since we don't have any information that connects Max directly to sterpuses or impuses, we can't use this chain.\\n\\nPremise (19) tells us that each sterpus is not large.

If we can show that Max is a rompus, we can then use this premise to say that Max is also a sterpus, and then use premise (19) to say that Max is not large.\\n\\nTo show that Max is a rompus, we need to find a connection between Max and rompuses. Premise (2) states that every yumpus is a tumpus, and premise (8) states that tumpuses are numpuses. Since Max is a yumpus (premise 23), Max is also a tumpus and a numpus.
