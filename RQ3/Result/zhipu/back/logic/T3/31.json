We must find a premise that confirms Stella is a grimpus to derive the conclusion that Taylor is a visionary.\\n\\nPremise (2) states that every sterpus is a grimpus, but we need to establish that Stella is a sterpus or another type of being that is a grimpus. Premises (12) and (13) tell us that Stella is either a numpus, a yumpus, or a rompus, or a yumpus, a rompus, or a sterpus.
