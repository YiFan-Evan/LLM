The goal is to show that Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus. To do this, we can use the premises that describe the properties of lempus and the properties of Polly to make connections.\\n\\nFirst, we need a premise that connects dullness and brightness with lempus. From the premises given, (7) states that everything that is floral, earthy, and a lempus is a lorpus, but this does not help us with dullness and brightness. We need to find another way to link lempus with these properties.\\n\\nPremise (2) tells us that everything that is sweet, spicy, and a rompus is a lempus. We know from (10) that Polly is sweet, and from (8) that Polly is spicy, so Polly matches the criteria for being a lempus according to (2), except for being a rompus.\\n\\nPremise (15) tells us that Polly is a rompus. This means that by combining (2) and (15), we can conclude that Polly is a lempus because she is sweet, spicy, and a rompus.\\n\\nNow we need to connect dullness and brightness to Polly. We have (11) that Polly is bright and (13) that Polly is dull. These two premises together with the fact that Polly is a lempus (derived from (2) and (15)) fulfill the proof obligation.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal set of premise propositions that allows us to derive the proof obligation (16) is (2), (8), (10), (11), (13), and (15).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(8),(10),(11),(13),(15)->(16)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is dull, bright, and a lempus then Taylor is a visionary.
