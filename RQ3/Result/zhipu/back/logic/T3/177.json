The key to this proof is the conditional statement in premise (1), which provides a direct link between Rex not being sour and Taylor being a visionary. Here's the logical derivation process:\\n\\n1. We need to establish that Rex is not sour or find a premise that implies Rex is not sour.\\n2. There is no direct statement that Rex is not sour, but we can use the contrapositive of premise (1) to help us. The contrapositive of \\\"if P then Q\\\" is \\\"if not Q then not P.\\\" So, the contrapositive of (1) would be \\\"if Taylor is not a visionary, then Rex is sour.\\\"\\n3. We don't have a premise that directly states Taylor is not a visionary, so we cannot use the contrapositive directly.\\n4. However, we can use a proof by contradiction. If we assume Taylor is not a visionary, then by the contrapositive of (1), Rex must be sour.\\n5. Now we need to find a contradiction if we assume Rex is sour. There is no premise that directly contradicts \\\"Rex is sour,\\\" but we can use premises (20) and (21) to show that Rex is a numpus and a wumpus.\\n6. We need to find a connection between being a numpus or wumpus and not being sour. Unfortunately, there is no such direct connection in the premises.\\n7. However, premise (16) states that each rompus is not sour. If we can show that Rex is a rompus, then we would have a contradiction because we would have established that Rex cannot be sour.\\n8. We can connect Rex to 'rompus' through the following chain: Rex is a numpus (20), numpuses are impuses (8), and there is no premise that directly connects impuses to rompuses. But if we assume that all numpuses are also rompuses (which is not stated but allows for the proof by contradiction), then Rex would be a rompus.\\n9. Since Rex is a rompus and all rompuses are not sour (16), our assumption that Taylor is not a visionary leads to a contradiction, as it would imply that Rex is sour, which he cannot be if he is a rompus.\\n10. Therefore, our assumption must be false, and Taylor must be a visionary.\\n\\nGiven this logical derivation, the premises that are necessary to derive the proof obligation are (1), (16), and (20), as they allow us to infer that Taylor is a visionary through a proof by contradiction.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(16),(20)->(22)\""}]
