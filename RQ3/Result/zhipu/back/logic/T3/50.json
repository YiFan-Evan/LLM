To do this, we must first establish that Max is not an impus using the given premises.\\n\\nFrom premises (5), (16), (12), and (8), we can deduce that Max is a zumpus, a wumpus, a gorpus, and a jompus. Since Max is a jompus and premise (10) states that jompuses are yumpuses, we can deduce that Max is a yumpus. Now, premise (13) states that everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a yumpus. Since Max is a zumpus and a wumpus (a type of tumpus), if Max were also an impus, he would be a yumpus, which would not contradict anything. However, we don't need to prove that Max is an impus; we need to show that he is not an impus to satisfy premise (1).\\n\\nTo show that Max is not an impus, we can use a proof by contradiction. If we assume that Max is an impus, then by premise (13), Max would also be a yumpus. But we already established that Max is a jompus, and by premise (10), jompuses are yumpuses, which means Max is a yumpus regardless of whether he is an impus. This does not provide a contradiction, so we cannot use this to prove that Max is not an impus.\\n\\nInstead, we need to look at premise (9), which states that everything that is a zumpus, a tumpus, and an impus is a grimpus. Since Max is a zumpus and a wumpus, if he were also an impus, he would be a grimpus. But we have no information that Max is a grimpus, and we don't need it because we can use premise (4), which states that everything that is a zumpus, a wumpus, and a gorpus is a vumpus. Since Max is a zumpus, a wumpus, and a gorpus, he must be a vumpus. Being a vumpus is a property that is not compatible with being an impus, as there is no premise suggesting that something can be both a vumpus and an impus.\\n\\nTherefore, we have established that Max is not an impus by using premises (4), (5), (12), and (8).
