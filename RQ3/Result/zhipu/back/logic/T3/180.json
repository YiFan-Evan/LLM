From (1), we know that everything that is a vumpus is a tumpus. Next, from (5) we know that everything that is a sterpus, a zumpus, or an impus is a shumpus.

Since Sally is a vumpus, we can work backward to see if she can be an impus. From (4), we know each brimpus is a lorpus. Since Sally is a brimpus (from (12)), she is also a lorpus. Now, going back to (2), we know that everything that is a dumpus, a shumpus, or a wumpus is a tumpus. Since Sally is a lorpus and a lorpus is not listed as a condition for being a tumpus in this premise, we cannot use this to conclude that Sally is an impus.\\n\\nWe need to find a contradiction that shows Sally cannot be an impus.
