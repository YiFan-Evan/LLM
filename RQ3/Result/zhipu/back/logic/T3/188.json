Since Rex is a jompus, it follows that Rex is also a grimpus.

We look at premise (1), which states that if Rex is a tumpus or a dumpus or a wumpus, then Taylor is a visionary.\\n\\nTo use modus ponens (a form of logical deduction), we need to have the antecedent of the conditional statement (Rex is a tumpus or a dumpus or a wumpus) established as true to conclude the consequent (Taylor is a visionary).
