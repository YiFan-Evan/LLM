The goal is to show that Rex cannot be a lempus. To do this, we will look for contradictions or inconsistencies that arise if we assume Rex is a lempus and use the given premises to derive the proof obligation.\\n\\nFirst, let's identify the relevant premises that deal with lempuses and their relationships to other categories mentioned in the proof obligation:\\n\\n- (2) Every wumpus is a lempus and a gorpus and an impus.\\n- (7) Each lempus is a rompus.\\n- (11) Lempuses are wumpuses.\\n- (16) Each lempus is a dumpus.\\n\\nWe also need to consider the premises that describe Rex's attributes:\\n\\n- (1) Rex is a lorpus.\\n- (10) Rex is a dumpus.\\n- (12) Rex is a sterpus.\\n- (15) Rex is a vumpus.\\n- (17) Rex is a dumpus.\\n- (18) Rex is a vumpus.\\n- (19) Rex is a numpus.\\n- (20) Rex is a yumpus.\\n\\nTo prove that Rex is not a lempus, we need to find a contradiction. Let's use the fact that Rex is a dumpus (premises 10 and 17) and that each lempus is a dumpus (premise 16). This does not immediately lead to a contradiction, but let's continue.\\n\\nSince Rex is a vumpus (premises 15 and 18), and every wumpus is a lempus (premise 2), one might initially think that Rex must be a lempus. However, we need to check if there's any premise that would contradict Rex being a lempus. Looking at the premises, there's nothing directly stating that Rex cannot be a lempus based on his being a vumpus or dumpus alone.\\n\\nBut we need to consider the proof obligation: we need to show that Rex is not a lempus. To do this, we can use premises that show the properties of shumpuses, because if Rex were a lempus, he would also be a wumpus (premise 11), and if he were a wumpus, he could potentially be a shumpus (premise 6). However, premise 13 states that shumpuses are not impuses. Since we don't have a direct premise that connects Rex to being a shumpus, we need to look for an indirect contradiction.\\n\\nIf we assume Rex is a lempus, he would also be a rompus (premise 7). But if Rex were a rompus, and given that each gorpus is a rompus (premise 3), and Rex is not a gorpus because he is a lorpus (premise 1) and there's no premise stating that a lorpus can also be a gorpus, we have a contradiction.\\n\\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises needed to derive that Rex is not a lempus is:\\n\\n(1),(3),(7)->(21)\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(7)->(21)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Rex is not a lempus then Taylor is a visionary.
