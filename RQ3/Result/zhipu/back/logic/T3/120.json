Since we need to prove that Alex is a tumpus, we should look for premises that indicate Alex is one of those three types. From (11), we learn that Alex is a sterpus, and from (14), we know that Alex is a zumpus. However, from (5), we know that zumpuses are jompuses, and from (9), we know that Alex is a jompus. While this establishes that Alex is a jompus, it doesn't help us directly with the conclusion about Alex being a tumpus. But from (11) again, we also know that Alex is a sterpus, which, according to (6), makes Alex a tumpus.\\n\\nLastly, we need to show that Alex is not a gorpus.
