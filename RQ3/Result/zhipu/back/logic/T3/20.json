By transitivity, Alex is also a yumpus.\\n\\nFrom premise (6), we know that yumpuses are impuses. Therefore, Alex is an impus.\\n\\nPremise (4) states that impuses are dumpuses and lorpuses.

If we can show that Alex is a numpus, then we can also conclude that Alex is a brimpus because of the transitive property of the relationships.\\n\\nPremise (3) states that gorpuses are zumpuses.
