We can use the transitive property, contradictions, and definitions to link the premises to the proof obligation.\\n\\nFirst, we need to find a connection between Max and the property of being moderate. We see that Max is a gorpus (24) and every gorpus is a tumpus (5). We also know that every wumpus is not moderate (8) and that wumpuses are sterpuses (13). If we can connect tumpuses to wumpuses or sterpuses, we can use the property of wumpuses not being moderate to conclude that Max is not moderate.\\n\\nPremise (20) tells us that every wumpus is a lorpus, and premise (16) tells us that each lorpus is not small. However, we need a connection between tumpuses and wumpuses or sterpuses. We don't have a direct connection, but we can use premises (21) and (22) to connect zumpuses to both wumpuses and shumpuses. Since zumpuses are shumpuses (21) and shumpuses are not sweet (3), and zumpuses are wumpuses (22), we can deduce that there's a connection between wumpuses and something related to shumpuses.\\n\\nNow, we need to connect Max to the wumpuses. Since Max is a brimpus (23) and every brimpus is a numpus (6), and numpuses are melodic (1), we are not yet close to the property of not being moderate. But premise (12) tells us that each numpus is a lempus, and premise (19) tells us that lempuses are zumpuses. This gives us a chain: Max -> brimpus -> numpus -> lempus -> zumpus. Since zumpuses are wumpuses (22), we can say that Max is indirectly connected to wumpuses.\\n\\nNow, with the connection between Max and wumpuses established through a chain of premises, we can use premise (8) that every wumpus is not moderate to conclude that Max, being connected to wumpuses, is also not moderate.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (5),(8),(20),(21),(22),(23),(6),(1),(12),(19)->(25)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
