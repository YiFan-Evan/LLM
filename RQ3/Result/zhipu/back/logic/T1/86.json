Since we've established that Sally is both a gorpus and a lorpus, we need to show she is also a vumpus. From premise (8), we know that Sally is indeed a vumpus.\\n\\nNow, using premises (1) and the facts that Sally is a gorpus, a lorpus, and a vumpus, we can deduce that Sally is a yumpus.\\n\\nPremise (6) states that everything that is a gorpus, a sterpus, and a shumpus is also a jompus, a numpus, and a rompus.
