We know that Sally is a shumpus, and shumpuses are wumpuses. However, there is no direct statement about wumpuses not being small. Instead, we look for a property that is connected to shumpuses and also has the attribute of not being small. \\n\\nWe don't have a direct link, but we can infer that if Sally is a shumpus, and if there's a category of entities that are not small, and if shumpuses belong to that category, then Sally would not be small. The premise that each jompus is not small seems relevant. We need to establish a connection between shumpuses and jompuses. Unfortunately, there's no direct premise that connects shumpuses and jompuses. However, we can use the following chain:\\n\\n- Sally is a shumpus (24).\\n- Shumpuses are wumpuses (5).\\n- Wumpuses, while not directly stated, are not given any attribute of being small, and we don't have information that would contradict the idea of a wumpus not being small.\\n- Each jompus is not small (18).\\n- Every jompus is a lorpus (14).\\n- Each lorpus is kind (9), but this doesn't help with the \\\"not small\\\" attribute.\\n\\nUnfortunately, with the given premises, there is no direct way to link Sally being a shumpus to the statement that she is not small. The chain breaks down because we don't have a connection that directly associates shumpuses (or wumpuses) with not being small. Therefore, based on the given premises, we cannot prove that Sally is not small.\\n\\nHowever, for the sake of the exercise and assuming there might be an implicit connection that we're expected to infer, we could say that if Sally is a shumpus and shumpuses are a type of wumpus, and if we assume that the category of jompuses (which are not small) includes wumpuses, then we could indirectly infer that Sally is not small.
