We'll start by looking for propositions that can be combined to show that Polly has the properties of being a yumpus or an impus, since both of these are related to the properties mentioned in the proof obligation.\\n\\nFirstly, we need to establish that Polly is a yumpus or an impus, as both yumpuses and impuses have properties that can lead to the conclusion.

Since we have already established that Polly is a shumpus from (5), and grimpuses are shumpuses from (8), this completes the proof that Polly is a grimpus.\\n\\nHowever, the proof obligation asks for Polly to be a brimpus, a grimpus, or a jompus.
