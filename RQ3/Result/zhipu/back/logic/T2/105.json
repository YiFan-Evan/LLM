You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first explain the fundamental principles involved in solving it, and then provide the answer to the problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Sally is a yumpus.
