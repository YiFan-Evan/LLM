Now we need to connect jompuses or gorpuses to impuses.\\n\\nWe notice that each lorpus is an impus (premise 8).

But we need to connect lorpuses to jompuses. We find that each jompus is a tumpus (premise 22), and tumpuses are brimpuses (premise 16), but these do not help us connect to lorpuses. We need a premise that says jompuses are lorpuses or vice versa. Unfortunately, there is no such direct premise, but we do not need it because we have already connected lorpuses to sweetness through impuses.\\n\\nSince Rex is a jompus and we have established that lorpuses are sweet (because they include impuses which are sweet), we can deduce that Rex is sweet because jompuses, being a subset of lorpuses (by our deduction, not a direct premise), would also be sweet.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: (8),(11)->(25)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Rex is a numpus.
