[{"role": "user", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first explain the fundamental principles involved in solving it, and then provide the answer to the problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OK."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Yumpuses are sterpuses and jompuses.

According to premise (6), vumpuses are grimpuses and lorpuses. However, this doesn't directly help us, as we need to link Sally to being a yumpus and a wumpus.\\n\\nFrom (10), we also know Sally is a rompus. According to premise (7), rompuses are vumpuses and gorpuses. This tells us that since Sally is a rompus, she is also a vumpus (which we already knew) and a gorpus.\\n\\nWe have now shown that Sally is a gorpus based on the information that she is a rompus, and rompuses are gorpuses.
