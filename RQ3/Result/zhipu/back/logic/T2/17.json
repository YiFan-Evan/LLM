We can see from (23) that Max is a brimpus, and from (11) that brimpuses are vumpuses. However, we need to connect vumpuses to wumpuses to use (8). We don't have a direct statement that vumpuses are wumpuses, but we can use (13) and (22) to connect wumpuses to zumpuses, and then (21) to connect zumpuses to shumpuses. Unfortunately, we don't have a direct connection between shumpuses and wumpuses or vumpuses. We do have (12) that numpuses are lempuses, and (6) that brimpuses are numpuses. But we still lack a direct connection between lempuses and wumpuses.\\n\\nWe notice that we can use (4) to say that lempuses are grimpuses, and from (11) that brimpuses are vumpuses. If we can connect grimpuses to wumpuses, we can use (8). However, there is no direct statement connecting grimpuses to wumpuses.\\n\\nThe critical connection we are missing is that all wumpuses are also lorpus (from (20)), and every lorpus is not small (from (16)), which doesn't help us directly. But if we look at (13), we see that wumpuses are sterpuses, and we have no information about sterpuses that helps us here.\\n\\nIt seems we have hit a dead end because we cannot connect any of the properties of Max as a brimpus or gorpus to the property of not being moderate. We don't have a premise that directly connects brimpuses or gorpuses to wumpuses in a way that would allow us to use (8).\\n\\nTherefore, based on the given premises, we cannot derive the proof obligation that \\\"Max is not moderate.\\\" There is insufficient information to connect the premises to the conclusion.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: There is no minimal set of premises that can derive (25) \\\"Max is not moderate\\\" from the given premises.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Max is a gorpus.
