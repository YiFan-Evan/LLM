Since the path is circular and has 20 dots, we can think of each dot as a position number from 1 to 20, with the top dot being position 1.

If we reach a position number less than 1 or greater than 20, we wrap around the circle accordingly (since it's a circular path).\\n\\nLet's break down the movements:\\n\\n1. Start at the tent. Since the tent is not the top of the path, we need to know its position. However, the position of the tent is not given directly, so we have to count from the top (face powder) to the tent. There are 5 items between the face powder and the tent (Angora rabbit, tent, dung beetle, Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier, Shetland Sheepdog), so the tent is at position 6.\\n\\n2. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise from the tent: 6 - 2 = 4. This brings us to the position of the Angora rabbit.\\n\\n3. Move 5 steps clockwise from the Angora rabbit: 4 + 5 = 9. This brings us to the position of the cliff dwelling.\\n\\n4. Move 9 steps clockwise from the cliff dwelling: 9 + 9 = 18. This brings us to the position of the tiger.\\n\\n5. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise from the tiger: 18 - 8 = 10.

Move 18 steps clockwise from the horizontal bar (position 8): 8 + 18 = 26. We wrap around the circle by subtracting 20 from 26: 26 - 20 = 6.
