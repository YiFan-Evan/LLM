Since the path consists of 20 connected dots, moving 20 steps in either direction will bring us back to the starting point.\\n\\nThe movements described are in multiples of 6 (18, 10, 6, and 19), which means we can simplify the problem by looking at the remainders of these movements when divided by 20 (since moving 20 steps returns us to the starting point). This is because the circular path creates a modular arithmetic system where positions are equivalent if they are separated by a multiple of the total number of positions (20 in this case).\\n\\nLet's calculate the position after each movement, considering that we start at the home theater (without loss of generality, let's assume the home theater is at position 1):\\n\\n1.
