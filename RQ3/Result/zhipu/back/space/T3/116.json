Starting from the gown, move 2 steps counter-clockwise. This will take us to the boa constrictor.\\n2. Move 16 steps clockwise from the boa constrictor. Since the path has 10 dots, we can simplify this movement by considering that every 10 steps we make a full loop and end up at the starting point. Therefore, 16 steps clockwise is the same as 16 mod 10, which is 6 steps. This will take us past the gown, the wolf spider, the saxophone, the shopping cart, and two more steps to the mud turtle.\\n3. Move 14 steps clockwise from the mud turtle.
