If we move 17 steps clockwise from the starting position at the plate, we will end up at the same position as if we moved 17 % 20 steps, because after 20 steps we would loop back to the start. So, 17 % 20 = -3 (since we're considering negative steps as counter-clockwise movement).\\n\\nNow we need to move 3 steps counter-clockwise from the plate:\\n- 1 step counter-clockwise from the plate leads to the drilling rig.\\n- 2 steps counter-clockwise leads to the prayer rug.\\n- 3 steps counter-clockwise leads to the Keeshond.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Keeshond.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
