The circular path has 20 dots, and moving clockwise around the circle means we pass from one dot to the next in the given sequence.\\n\\nWhen moving around a circle, if we move n steps from a given point, we land on the item that is n positions ahead in the sequence. If the number of steps is equal to or greater than the number of dots in the circle, we must find the remainder after dividing the number of steps by the number of dots (in this case, 20).
