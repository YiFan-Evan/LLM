Since the path is circular and consists of 20 connected dots, we can think of the movement in terms of modular arithmetic, where we take the total number of steps moved and use modulo 20 to find the final position on the path.\\n\\nHere's the process step by step:\\n\\n1. Start at the sundial.\\n2. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\\n3. Move 15 steps counter-clockwise.\\n4. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise.\\n5. Move 16 steps clockwise.\\n\\nSince we're moving counter-clockwise, we subtract the number of steps from our current position. When moving clockwise, we add the steps to our position.\\n\\nStarting at the sundial, which we can consider as position 0, we have:\\n\\n1. Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from position 0 (sundial) takes us to position -3. Since the path is circular, we find the equivalent position by taking the modulo with 20: (-3) % 20 = 17. Position 17 is the movie theater.\\n2. Moving 15 steps counter-clockwise from position 17 (movie theater) takes us to position 17 - 15 = 2. Position 2 is the bald eagle.\\n3.
