Identify the starting position: The traffic light is the last item mentioned before the movements, so we start there. Since there are 20 items in total, we can assign the traffic light as position 20.\\n\\n2. Calculate the movements: We move 7 steps counter-clockwise, then 16 steps counter-clockwise, then 1 step counter-clockwise, and finally 6 steps clockwise.\\n\\n3. Combine the movements: To simplify, we can add the counter-clockwise steps and then subtract the clockwise steps. So, the total movement in a counter-clockwise direction is 7 + 16 + 1 = 24 steps. Then we subtract the 6 clockwise steps: 24 - 6 = 18 steps counter-clockwise.\\n\\n4. Calculate the final position: Since we're moving counter-clockwise, we subtract the total steps from the starting position. Position 20 minus 18 steps counter-clockwise brings us to position 2.\\n\\n5.
