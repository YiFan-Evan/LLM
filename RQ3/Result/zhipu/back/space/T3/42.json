Next, we move 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Since the path has 10 dots, 20 steps will take us all the way around the circle twice, which means we will end up back at the starting point from where we began the counter-clockwise movement. However, since we have already moved 6 steps clockwise from the valley, we need to subtract those 6 steps from the 20 steps we are moving counter-clockwise.
