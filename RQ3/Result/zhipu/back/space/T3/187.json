The map is circular, with 20 items evenly spaced around it.\\n2. Moving clockwise means moving from one item to the next in the given sequence.\\n3. Moving counter-clockwise means moving from one item to the previous one in the reverse of the given sequence.\\n4. When moving around a circle, if you move the same number of steps in opposite directions, you end up in the same position.\\n\\nGiven that you move 7 steps clockwise and then 20 steps counter-clockwise, you are effectively moving 20 - 7 = 13 steps counter-clockwise because moving 20 steps in the opposite direction cancels out the 7 steps you took clockwise.\\n\\nSince the path has 20 dots, moving 13 steps counter-clockwise from the academic gown would bring you to the 13th item before the academic gown in the given sequence.

The map is circular with 20 items.\\n2. Moving 14 steps clockwise from the academic gown will bring us to the 14th item in the sequence.\\n3. Moving 40 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 40 items backward in the sequence. However, since the map is circular, we can also think of this as moving 40 - 20 = 20 steps clockwise, which brings us back to the starting point (academic gown), and then another 20 steps clockwise from there.\\n4. To find the net movement, we add the clockwise movements and subtract the counter-clockwise movements: 14 (clockwise) + 20 (equivalent of 40 counter-clockwise) = 34 steps clockwise.\\n\\nNow, we need to find the item located 34 steps clockwise from the academic gown. Since there are 20 items, we can calculate the position by taking the total steps and finding the remainder when divided by the number of items:\\n\\n34 % 20 = 14\\n\\nThis means that we end up 14 steps from the starting point after accounting for the full rotations.
