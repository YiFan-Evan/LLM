We count 5 dots clockwise from the European polecat and find the item on the 5th dot.\\n\\nThe second movement is 18 steps from the same starting point. We count 18 dots clockwise and find the item on the 18th dot.\\n\\nThe third movement is another 18 steps. Since we've already counted 18 steps before, we would count another 18 steps, which means we are moving 36 steps in total from the starting point in a clockwise direction.\\n\\nThe fourth movement is 5 steps again from the new position.\\n\\nTo find the final item after all these movements, we need to calculate the total number of steps taken and then find the item at that position.
