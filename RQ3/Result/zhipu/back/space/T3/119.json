Moving 18 steps clockwise from the tench will take us past the military uniform, the Scottish Deerhound, and the Scottish Terrier, and continue around the circle. Since the path is circular with 10 dots, we can calculate the position by taking the remainder of the steps divided by 10 (18 % 10 = 8).
