The circular path has 10 dots, so moving 10 dots in a clockwise direction brings us back to the starting point.\\n\\nHere are the movements:\\n\\n1. Move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction. This will bring us back to the starting point, which is the ping-pong ball.\\n2. Move around the ring by 14 steps in a clockwise direction. Since we are starting from the ping-pong ball again, we count 14 steps forward. This will take us past the loupe and the snoek, and we will end up at the dot after the snoek, which is the dot where the Pekingese is located.\\n3. Move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Starting from the Pekingese, we move 4 steps backward. This will take us past the cucumber and the swing, and we will end up at the dot with the tricycle.\\n\\nAdding up the movements: 10 (clockwise) + 14 (clockwise) - 4 (counter-clockwise) = 20 steps clockwise. Since 20 steps is exactly twice the number of dots on the path, we end up at the same position we would be after 10 steps, which is the ping-pong ball.
