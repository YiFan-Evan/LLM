Starting at the soda bottle, moving 2 steps clockwise from the Lhasa Apso brings us to the shield.\\n2. From the shield, moving 10 steps clockwise brings us to the space bar (since we pass 9 other items, which is one full loop around the circle).\\n3. From the space bar, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise (because 20 is 2 times the total number of dots, which means we would complete 2 full loops and end up where we started if we moved clockwise, or 2 steps past the starting point if we moved counter-clockwise).\\n\\nSo after moving 2 steps clockwise from the space bar, we will land on the wing.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: wing.\""}]
