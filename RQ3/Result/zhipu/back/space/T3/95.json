Move another 8 steps clockwise.\\n\\nFirst, we add the steps together: 12 + 8 = 20 steps.\\n\\nSince there are 10 dots on the path, we can determine the final position by taking the total number of steps (20) and finding the remainder when divided by the number of dots (10).

In this case, since we are already at the police van, we don't move at all after the 20 steps\u2014because we've looped around completely and are back at the starting point.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: police van.\""}]
