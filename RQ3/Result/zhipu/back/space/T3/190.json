Starting at the Afghan Hound (position 8), move 13 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   8 - 13 = -5\\n   Adding 20 to -5 gives us 15, which is the position of the bell-cot.\\n\\n2. From the bell-cot (position 15), move 15 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   15 - 15 = 0\\n   Since we're at position 0, we are at the top of the path, where the tricycle is located.\\n\\n3.
