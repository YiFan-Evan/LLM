Move 15 steps CCW from the bow.\\n2. Move 16 steps CW.\\n3. Move 9 steps CW.\\n4. Move 6 steps CW.\\n\\nSince the path has 20 dots, we can think of each dot as a position numbered 1 to 20, with the bow being at a position we'll call \\\"0\\\" for simplicity. Moving CCW is like subtracting from the current position, and moving CW is like adding to the current position. When we reach a number less than 1, we add 20 to wrap around to the other side of the circle. Similarly, when we reach a number greater than 20, we subtract 20 to wrap around to the beginning of the circle.\\n\\nStarting at the bow (position 0):\\n1. Moving 15 steps CCW: 0 - 15 = -15. Adding 20 to wrap around: -15 + 20 = 5. We are now at position 5, which is the mashed potato.\\n2. Moving 16 steps CW from the mashed potato (position 5): 5 + 16 = 21.
