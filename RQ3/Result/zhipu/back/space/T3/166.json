Each movement changes our position by a certain number of dots, and since the map is circular, we can think of the movements as adding or subtracting from our current position, with an overflow or underflow wrapping around to the beginning or end of the path.\\n\\nGiven that there are 20 dots on the path, moving 20 steps in either direction would bring us back to the starting point. Therefore, any movement that is a multiple of 20 will not change our position.\\n\\nLet's calculate the net movement:\\n\\n- Moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the Maltese is equivalent to moving 17 steps clockwise (since 20 - 3 = 17).\\n- Moving 19 steps clockwise is straightforward and does not need conversion.\\n- Moving 13 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 7 steps clockwise (since 20 - 13 = 7).\\n- Moving 9 steps clockwise is straightforward and does not need conversion.\\n\\nNow, let's add up the movements:\\n\\n17 (counter-clockwise from Maltese) + 19 (clockwise) + 7 (counter-clockwise) + 9 (clockwise) = 52 steps clockwise.\\n\\nSince 52 is more than 20, we need to find the equivalent movement within one full loop of the circle.
