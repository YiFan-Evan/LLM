Since the path is circular and has 20 dots, moving 18 steps backward from any point will bring us to the item that is 2 steps forward in a clockwise direction from the original point. This is because 20 - 18 = 2, and moving backward 18 steps from a point is equivalent to moving forward 2 steps in the opposite direction.\\n\\nAfter moving 18 steps counter-clockwise from the umbrella, we will be at the point where we started, which is the umbrella. Then, we are instructed to move 2 more steps in a counter-clockwise direction.
