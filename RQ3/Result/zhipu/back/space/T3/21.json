Since the path is circular and consists of 5 connected dots, moving around the ring by the total number of steps will bring us back to the starting point or to a position that is a certain number of steps away from it, depending on the total steps taken.\\n\\nThe items on the path in clockwise order are: common squirrel monkey, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, electric locomotive, hoop skirt, and seashore.

Since we've already moved 6 steps, we add those to the 8, resulting in a total of 14 steps.
