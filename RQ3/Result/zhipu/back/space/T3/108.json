We can add these movements together to find the total number of steps moved:\\n\\n7 steps + 1 step + 8 steps = 16 steps\\n\\nNow, because the path is circular, we need to consider that after moving past the 10th dot, we loop back around to the first dot. To find out where we end up after 16 steps, we can take the total number of steps and use the modulo operation with the number of dots in the path (10), which will give us the position relative to the starting point:\\n\\n16 % 10 = 6\\n\\nThis means we end up 6 dots away from where we started, moving counter-clockwise.
