Moving 18 steps counter-clockwise from the academic gown. Since we are moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 18 from the current position (1st item). However, since the path is circular, we can also think of this as moving 2 steps clockwise (because 10 - 18 = -8, and -8 modulo 10 is 2). This will take us to the carousel.\\n\\n3. Moving 8 steps clockwise from the carousel. This will take us to the rhinoceros beetle because the carousel is the 2nd item, and moving 8 steps forward lands us on the 10th item, which is the rhinoceros beetle.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: rhinoceros beetle.\""}]
