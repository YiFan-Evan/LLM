Moving clockwise by 18 steps from the common gallinule will take us past the Irish Wolfhound and back around to the path. Since the path has 10 dots, we can calculate the position by taking the total steps moved and finding the remainder when divided by the number of dots (10). So, 18 % 10 = 8, which means we end up 8 steps from the starting point.\\n3. After 18 steps clockwise, we are at the lemon.\\n\\nNext, we move 12 steps counter-clockwise from the lemon:\\n\\n4.

We moved 18 steps clockwise and then 12 + 14 = 26 steps counter-clockwise.\\n9. To find the net movement, we subtract the counter-clockwise steps from the clockwise steps: 18 - 26 = -8. Since we are moving in a circular path, we take the absolute value of the net movement and find the remainder when divided by the number of dots (10): |-8| % 10 = 2.\\n10. This means we have moved 2 steps backward from the starting point.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Basset Hound.\""}]
