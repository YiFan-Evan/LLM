When we reach the end of the sequence (either 20 or 1), we wrap around to the beginning (either 1 or 20).\\n\\nHere's the sequence of movements:\\n1. Start at the golf ball (position 1).\\n2. Move 8 steps counter-clockwise, which would take us to position 13 (since we wrap around after 20).\\n3. Move 5 steps clockwise from position 13, which would take us to position 18.\\n4. Move 16 steps clockwise from position 18, which would take us to position 2 (since 18 + 16 = 34, and 34 - 20 = 14, and 14 + 1 = 15, but we wrap around after 20 so it's position 2).\\n5. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise from position 2, which would take us to position 9 (since 2 - 14 = -12, and -12 + 20 = 8, and 8 + 1 = 9).\\n\\nNow, looking at the items on the path in their given order, we can identify the item at position 9:\\n1.
