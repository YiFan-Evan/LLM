The movement in one direction can be counteracted by an equivalent movement in the opposite direction. For example, moving 1 step clockwise and then 1 step counter-clockwise will bring us back to our original position.\\n3. When moving around a circular path, if we move more steps than the number of dots, we will loop around and end up at a position that can be determined by taking the total steps moved and finding the remainder when divided by the number of dots.\\n\\nGiven that we start at the scorpion:\\n\\n- Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: This will take us past the library and to the dot before the library.\\n- Move 5 steps clockwise: This will take us past the scorpion, the African rock python, the gas pump, and we will stop at the nematode.\\n\\nSince we are moving in a circular path, we can also calculate our final position mathematically. We start at the scorpion, which we can consider as position 2 (since the library is position 1, moving clockwise).
