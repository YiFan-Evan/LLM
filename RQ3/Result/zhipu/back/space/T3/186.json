When moving in a circle, if you exceed the number of items (in this case, 20 dots), you loop back around to the beginning. This means that each complete loop around the circle brings you back to the starting point.\\n\\nTo find the item after a series of movements, we can add up all the steps taken in one direction and then subtract the steps taken in the opposite direction. This will give us the net movement around the circle. Since the circle has 20 dots, any net movement that is a multiple of 20 will bring us back to the starting point. We then need to account for the remainder of the steps, which will determine our final position.\\n\\nLet's calculate the net movement:\\n\\n1. Move 15 steps clockwise from the green mamba.\\n2. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise.\\n3. Move 17 steps clockwise.\\n4. Move 10 steps clockwise.\\n\\nNow, we add the clockwise steps and subtract the counter-clockwise steps:\\n\\n15 (clockwise) - 6 (counter-clockwise) + 17 (clockwise) + 10 (clockwise) = 36 steps clockwise.\\n\\nSince 36 is a multiple of 20 (20 * 1 = 20, and 20 * 2 = 40), we know that after moving 36 steps clockwise, we will loop around once and end up at the same position as we started from, which is the green mamba. However, because we are moving 36 steps, we need to find the position that is 16 steps (36 - 20) beyond the green mamba (since we looped around once).\\n\\nCounting 16 steps clockwise from the green mamba, we pass the white-headed capuchin, the digital watch, the French horn, and the Chihuahua.
