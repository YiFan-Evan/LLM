Since the path is circular with 10 dots, we can think of each dot as a position number from 1 to 10, with the starting dot at the top being position 1.\\n\\nStarting from the oystercatcher, which we can consider as position 5 (since it's the fifth item from the pencil case), we move 6 steps clockwise. Moving 6 steps from position 5 will land us on position 11, but since there are only 10 positions, we wrap around to position 1 (because 11 - 10 = 1). The item at position 1 is the Papillon.\\n\\nNext, we move 16 steps counter-clockwise. Since we are moving in the opposite direction, we subtract these steps from our current position. Starting from position 1 and moving 16 steps counter-clockwise will land us on position -15 (because 1 - 16 = -15). To find the correct position, we add 10 to -15 until we are within the range of 1 to 10. -15 + 10 = -5, and -5 + 10 = 5.
