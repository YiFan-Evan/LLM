Since the map is circular with 10 dots, moving 10 steps in one direction brings us back to the starting point.\\n2. Moving in a counter-clockwise direction is equivalent to moving in a clockwise direction but in the opposite direction.\\n3. To find the final position after a series of movements, we can add the steps and then take the result modulo 10 (since there are 10 dots on the map). This will give us the position relative to the starting point.\\n\\nStarting from the planetarium, we first move 6 steps counter-clockwise.
