Since the path has 20 dots, each step counter-clockwise takes us to the previous item in the list.

To find the item after these steps, we count backwards 32 items on the list. However, because we have only 20 items, we will circle back around the list multiple times. We can find the item by taking the total steps and finding the remainder when divided by the number of items (20). This is because each full loop around the 20-item list is equivalent to moving 20 steps, which would bring us back to the starting point.\\n\\n32 steps counter-clockwise divided by 20 items gives us a remainder of 12 (32 % 20 = 12).
