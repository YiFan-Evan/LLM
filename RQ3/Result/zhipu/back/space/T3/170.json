Since 64 is a multiple of 20 (20 * 3 = 60, and 20 * 4 = 80, with 64 falling in between), we can subtract the largest multiple of 20 that is less than 64 from 64 to find out how many steps past the starting point we end up.\\n\\n64 - 60 = 4 steps.\\n\\nThis means after the total movement, we are 4 steps away from the Saluki in a clockwise direction.
