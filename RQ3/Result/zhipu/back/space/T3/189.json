When moving around a circular path, if you move a certain number of steps, you eventually loop back around to the beginning. In this case, since the path consists of 20 connected dots, any movement that is a multiple of 20 will bring you back to the starting point. If the movement is not a multiple of 20, we can find the new position by using the remainder of the division of the steps taken by 20.\\n\\nLet's calculate the final position after each movement:\\n\\n1. Starting at the breakwater, moving 7 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   7 steps counter-clockwise from the breakwater would be 7 positions back on the list. Since the list is circular, we can find the new position by subtracting 7 from the current position and taking the remainder when divided by 20 (the total number of items).\\n\\n2. Then, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   We need to add the 10 steps to the previous position (after the first 7 steps) and again take the remainder when divided by 20.\\n\\n3. Then, moving 18 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   Add another 18 steps to the position after the second movement and take the remainder when divided by 20.\\n\\n4. Finally, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   Add the last 5 steps to the position after the third movement and take the remainder when divided by 20.\\n\\nNow, let's do the calculations:\\n\\n1. Starting at the breakwater (which is the 8th item on the list), moving 7 steps counter-clockwise:\\n   8 - 7 = 1 (the position of the confectionery store)\\n\\n2. Then, moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from the confectionery store:\\n   1 - 10 = -9 (since we can't have a negative position on the list, we add 20)\\n   -9 + 20 = 11 (the position of the airship)\\n\\n3. Then, moving 18 steps counter-clockwise from the airship:\\n   11 - 18 = -7 (again, we add 20)\\n   -7 + 20 = 13 (the position of the dust jacket)\\n\\n4. Finally, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise from the dust jacket:\\n   13 - 5 = 8 (the position of the tiger beetle)\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: tiger beetle\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
