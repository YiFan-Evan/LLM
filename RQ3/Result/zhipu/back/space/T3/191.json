Each movement is effectively a shift from one dot to another, and since the map is circular, we can use modular arithmetic to determine the final position.\\n\\nHere's the process:\\n\\n1. Start at the sunscreen (which is the last item on the list).\\n2. Move 18 steps clockwise. Since there are 20 dots, moving 18 steps from the last item will land on the item 18 positions ahead, which is the same as 20 - 18 = 2 positions behind the last item (because the list wraps around). So we count 2 items counter-clockwise from the sunscreen.\\n3. Move 9 steps clockwise. This will land on the item 9 positions ahead of the current position.\\n4. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise. This will land on the item 14 positions behind the current position.\\n5. Move 13 steps clockwise. This will land on the item 13 positions ahead of the current position.\\n\\nNow we calculate the final position by applying each movement in sequence, starting from the sunscreen:\\n\\n- From the sunscreen (last item), moving 18 steps clockwise: 20 - 18 = 2 positions counter-clockwise (since we're moving backwards, we subtract from 20). This lands us at the position of the item before the last one, which is the \\\"Bluetick Coonhound.\\\"\\n- From the Bluetick Coonhound, moving 9 steps clockwise: we move forward from the Bluetick Coonhound to the 9th item ahead, which is the \\\"Brittany.\\\"\\n- From the Brittany, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise: we move back from the Brittany to the 14th item behind, which lands us at the \\\"Italian Greyhound.\\\"\\n- From the Italian Greyhound, moving 13 steps clockwise: we move forward from the Italian Greyhound to the 13th item ahead, which is the \\\"Gordon Setter.\\\"\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Gordon Setter.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
