So, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise from the ruler takes us to:\\n\\n8 (Ruler) - 1 step = 7 (Espresso machine)\\n7 (Espresso machine) - 1 step = 6 (Dough)\\n6 (Dough) - 1 step = 5 (Ring-necked snake)\\n\\nNow we are at the ring-necked snake, which is item number 5.\\n\\nNext, we are told to move 3 steps clockwise.
