We'll start from the salt shaker and follow the steps:\\n\\n1. Move 2 steps clockwise from the salt shaker.

Finally, move 18 steps counter-clockwise from the palace. Since the path is circular with 10 items, moving 18 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 2 steps clockwise (because 10 items make a full circle, and 18 is 10 + 8, which means we complete 1 full circle and then move 8 steps backward, which is the same as moving 2 steps forward).\\n\\nSo, starting from the palace and moving 2 steps clockwise, we will find the grocery store.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: grocery store.\""}]
