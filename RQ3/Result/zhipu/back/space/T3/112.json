We'll start at the limousine and follow the steps as described:\\n\\n1. Moving 18 steps counter-clockwise from the limousine, we would pass each item in reverse order. Since there are 10 items, we can calculate the position by subtracting 18 from the limousine's position and then taking the remainder when divided by 10 (to account for the circular nature). The limousine is the 5th item, so:\\n   5 - 18 = -13\\n   -13 % 10 = 7 (because we add 10 until we get a non-negative number)\\n   This brings us to the 7th position on the list, which is the Miniature Poodle.\\n\\n2. Next, we move 14 steps clockwise from the Miniature Poodle. We calculate the new position by adding 14 to the current position and taking the remainder when divided by 10:\\n   7 + 14 = 21\\n   21 % 10 = 1\\n   This brings us to the 1st position on the list, which is the macaque.\\n\\n3. Finally, we move 12 steps clockwise from the macaque. Again, we add 12 to the current position and take the remainder when divided by 10:\\n   1 + 12 = 13\\n   13 % 10 = 3\\n   This brings us to the 3rd position on the list, which is the crane (bird).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: crane (bird).\""}]
