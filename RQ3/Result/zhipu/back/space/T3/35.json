After two full rotations, you will end up at the same position you started from.\\n\\nHowever, since we are moving counter-clockwise, we need to count the steps in reverse order from the Carolina anole.

For the second rotation, you would pass the brown bear, the quill, the paddle, and then stop at the marmoset, which is 4 steps after the Carolina anole.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: marmoset.\\\"\""}]
