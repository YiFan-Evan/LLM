The net movement is (10 - 24 + 10 - 6) = -10 steps, which means we have moved 10 steps backward (counter-clockwise) from the starting point.\\n\\nSince the starting point is the acorn, moving 10 steps backward from the acorn on a 20-step circular path lands us at the item that is 10 steps clockwise from the acorn.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Egyptian Mau.\""}]
