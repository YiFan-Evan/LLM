Starting at the tub, moving 8 steps clockwise will land us on the (8th position from the tub). Since there are 10 dots, we can find the position using modulo 10 arithmetic: (current position + steps) mod 10.\\n2. We then move 9 steps from that position, again using modulo 10 arithmetic to find the new position.\\n3. Finally, we move 6 steps from the second position, using modulo 10 arithmetic once more.\\n\\nLet's calculate:\\n\\nStarting at the tub (let's say position 8, since we'll count from the tub as position 0):\\n1. 8 (starting position of the tub) + 8 steps = 16, mod 10 = 6 (since 16 - 10 = 6).\\n2. 6 (new position after the first movement) + 9 steps = 15, mod 10 = 5 (since 15 - 10 = 5).\\n3. 5 (new position after the second movement) + 6 steps = 11, mod 10 = 1 (since 11 - 10 = 1).\\n\\nSo, after the three movements, we are at position 1 on the circular path, which corresponds to the item after the tub moving clockwise. The items in order are: tub, sea urchin, harmonica, freight car, macaque, wolf spider, Golden Retriever, tandem bicycle, earth star, and hummingbird.
