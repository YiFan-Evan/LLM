Move 17 steps counter-clockwise.\\n3. Move 4 steps clockwise.\\n4. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise.\\n\\nFirst, let's find out where we end up after each movement, considering that moving clockwise is positive and counter-clockwise is negative.\\n\\n1. Starting at the minibus (which is 16 steps from the top drumstick if we count clockwise), moving 11 steps clockwise would be:\\n16 (starting position) + 11 (clockwise steps) = 27 steps from the drumstick.\\n\\nSince there are only 20 dots, we use modulo 20 to find the position:\\n27 % 20 = 7 (we end up 7 steps from the drumstick)\\n\\n2. Now, moving 17 steps counter-clockwise from this position:\\n7 (current position) - 17 (counter-clockwise steps) = -10 steps from the drumstick.\\n\\nAgain, we use modulo 20 to find the position:\\n-10 % 20 = 10 (we end up 10 steps from the drumstick)\\n\\n3. Moving 4 steps clockwise from this position:\\n10 (current position) + 4 (clockwise steps) = 14 steps from the drumstick.\\n\\n4.
