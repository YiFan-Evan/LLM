Since we have already moved 6 steps, we need to add the additional 14 steps to find our final position.

As we've already established that we are at the box turtle after the first 6 steps, we don't need to move any further to find the item after the total 20 steps, because the box turtle is the item we encounter immediately before the African bush elephant.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: box turtle.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
