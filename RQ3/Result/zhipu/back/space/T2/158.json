Since the path is circular, we can think of each dot as a position on the path, and each item as being located at one of these positions.\\n\\nThe path has 20 connected dots, which means that moving 20 steps in one direction will bring us back to the starting point. This allows us to use modular arithmetic to determine our final position after a series of movements.\\n\\nHere's the sequence of movements:\\n\\n1. Start at the gas pump and move 19 steps counter-clockwise.\\n2. Move 15 steps clockwise.\\n3. Move 12 steps clockwise.\\n4. Move 5 steps counter-clockwise.\\n\\nTo calculate our final position, we can add these movements together, taking into account that moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving clockwise in the negative direction. We can represent this as:\\n\\nFinal position = (Initial position + steps in clockwise direction - steps in counter-clockwise direction) mod number of dots\\n\\nSince we start at the position of the gas pump, we'll consider its position as 0. We can calculate the final position as follows:\\n\\nFinal position = (0 + 15 + 12 - 19 - 5) mod 20\\nFinal position = (27 - 24) mod 20\\nFinal position = 3 mod 20\\nFinal position = 3\\n\\nSo, after the series of movements, we end up at position 3 on the circular path.
