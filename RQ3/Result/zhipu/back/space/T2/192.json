Each movement is relative to the current position, and we must account for the circular nature by using modular arithmetic. This means that after moving a certain number of steps, if we surpass the number of dots (20 in this case), we wrap around to the beginning of the path.\\n\\nLet's break down the movements step by step:\\n\\n1. Starting from the ping-pong ball, move 12 steps clockwise.\\n2. Move 18 steps clockwise from the new position.\\n3. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise from the new position.\\n4. Move 15 steps counter-clockwise from the new position.\\n\\nWe'll calculate the final position after each movement, considering that moving clockwise increases the position index, and moving counter-clockwise decreases it. We'll use the modulo operation to wrap around the circular path.\\n\\nStarting position: ping-pong ball (index 12)\\n\\n1. Move 12 steps clockwise: 12 + 12 = 24. Since there are only 20 dots, we subtract 20 from 24 to wrap around: 24 - 20 = 4 (which is the index for the zucchini).\\n\\n2. Move 18 steps clockwise from the zucchini (index 4): 4 + 18 = 22. We subtract 20 to wrap around: 22 - 20 = 2 (which is the index for the consomme).\\n\\n3. Move 14 steps counter-clockwise from the consomme (index 2): 2 - 14 = -12. Since we can't have a negative index, we add 20 to wrap around: -12 + 20 = 8 (which is the index for the Miniature Poodle).\\n\\n4. Move 15 steps counter-clockwise from the Miniature Poodle (index 8): 8 - 15 = -7.
