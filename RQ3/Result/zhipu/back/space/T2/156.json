But since the path is circular, we can add 20 to find the equivalent positive position: -5 + 20 = 15 (the prayer rug).\\n- From the prayer rug (position 15), moving 2 steps clockwise brings us to position 17 (the Keeshond).\\n- From the Keeshond (position 17), moving 3 steps counter-clockwise brings us to position 14 (the coho salmon).\\n- From the coho salmon (position 14), moving 15 steps clockwise brings us to position 29. However, since there are only 20 positions, we use modulo 20 to find the actual position: 29 % 20 = 9 (the ring-necked snake).\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: ring-necked snake.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
