Since there are 20 dots on the path, we will use modulo 20 arithmetic.\\n\\nStarting from the eraser, we first move 2 steps counter-clockwise. Counter-clockwise movement can be thought of as negative steps in our modular arithmetic. So, moving 2 steps counter-clockwise from the eraser would be equivalent to moving 18 steps clockwise (since 20 - 2 = 18).\\n\\n1. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise from the eraser (which is the same as moving 18 steps clockwise from the eraser). This will land you on the wall clock.\\n\\nNext, we move 20 steps counter-clockwise. Since 20 is the total number of points on the path, moving 20 steps in either direction brings you back to the starting point. However, because we are moving counter-clockwise, we will end up at the same point we started from, which is the eraser.\\n\\n2. Move 20 steps counter-clockwise from the wall clock, which brings you back to the eraser.\\n\\nSince the second movement undoes the first movement in terms of position (you end up at the starting point of the second movement), the final position is the same as the starting position for the second movement.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: wall clock.\""}]
