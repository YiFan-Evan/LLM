Move 7 steps counter-clockwise from the lemon. This will take us to the American lobster, because moving 7 steps backward from the lemon (which is the 20th item) we pass the entertainment center, the Norwich Terrier, the tiger shark, and the American lobster is the 4th item before the lemon.\\n4. Finally, move 13 steps clockwise from the American lobster.
