The path has 20 connected dots, and we are given three movements:\\n\\n1. Move 13 steps clockwise from the golf cart.\\n2. Move 10 steps counter-clockwise.\\n3. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\\n\\nFirst, we need to find out where we end up after the first movement, which is 13 steps clockwise from the golf cart. Since the path is circular, we can use modular arithmetic to find the final position. If we consider the golf cart as position 0, moving 13 steps forward would be:\\n\\n0 (golf cart) + 13 steps = 13 (position on the circle)\\n\\nSince there are 20 positions on the circle, we can find the final position by taking the remainder of the division of the sum by 20:\\n\\n13 % 20 = 13\\n\\nSo after the first movement, we are at position 13, which is the spoonbill.\\n\\nNext, we move 10 steps counter-clockwise. This is equivalent to moving 10 steps backward. To find the new position, we subtract 10 from the current position and then use modular arithmetic to wrap around the circle if necessary:\\n\\n13 (spoonbill) - 10 steps = 3 (position on the circle)\\n\\nSo after the second movement, we are at position 3, which is the common redshank.\\n\\nFinally, we move 3 more steps counter-clockwise:\\n\\n3 (common redshank) - 3 steps = 0 (position on the circle)\\n\\nSince we end up at position 0, this means we are back at the starting dot, which is where the Lhasa Apso is located.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Lhasa Apso\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
