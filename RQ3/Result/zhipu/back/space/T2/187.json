Since the map is circular with 20 connected dots, moving around the ring by the total number of dots (20) in either direction will bring us back to the starting point.\\n\\nFirst, let's calculate the net movement:\\n\\nMoving 7 steps clockwise from the academic gown, we will land on the item after the academic gown, the maypole.\\n\\nThen, moving 20 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 20 steps clockwise because of the circular nature of the path (since 20 steps in either direction will bring us full circle back to the starting point).\\n\\nSo, we can combine these movements. Since moving 20 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 20 steps clockwise, we can simply add the 7 steps we moved clockwise initially to the 20 steps to find our final position.\\n\\n7 steps clockwise + 20 steps clockwise = 27 steps clockwise.\\n\\nNow, because there are only 20 dots, we can calculate the equivalent position by taking the total steps moved and subtracting the number of dots in the circle:\\n\\n27 steps - 20 dots = 7 steps beyond the starting point.\\n\\nSince we can't move beyond the 20th dot, we take the remainder of the division of the steps by the number of dots to find our position:\\n\\n27 % 20 = 7.\\n\\nThis means we end up 7 steps from the starting point, which is the same as the initial 7 steps we took clockwise. Therefore, the item we find is the same as the one we would find after moving 7 steps clockwise from the academic gown.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: maypole.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
