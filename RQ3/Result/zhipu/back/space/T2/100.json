When we move counter-clockwise, we are effectively moving backward along the path. When we move clockwise, we are moving forward along the path. If we move past the first or the last dot, we wrap around to the other end of the path because it is circular.\\n\\nLet's calculate the position after each movement:\\n\\n1. Starting at the European green lizard, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise would take us past the polar bear to the wool (because we move from the 2nd position to the 9th position).\\n\\n2. Then, moving 1 step clockwise from the wool takes us to the ice cream.\\n\\n3.
