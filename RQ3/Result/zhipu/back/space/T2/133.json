We start at the beaker and move 11 steps counter-clockwise, then we continue from that new position and move 9 more steps counter-clockwise.\\n\\nFirst principle: Moving counter-clockwise from a point on a circular path means moving in the direction that is the opposite of the path's intended direction (in this case, to the left instead of to the right).\\n\\nSecond principle: To find the new position after a certain number of steps, we subtract the number of steps from the starting position's index in the list of items, and then use the modulus operator to wrap around the list if necessary. Since there are 20 items on the path, we use modulus 20 to ensure we stay within the bounds of the list.\\n\\nStarting at the beaker, which is the 8th item on the list (counting from the Black and Tan Coonhound as the first), we move 11 steps counter-clockwise:\\n\\n8 - 11 = -3\\n\\nUsing modulus 20 to wrap around the list:\\n\\n(-3) mod 20 = 17\\n\\nThis means we end up 17 positions from the start (the Black and Tan Coonhound). Now, we need to move 9 more steps counter-clockwise from this new position:\\n\\n17 - 9 = 8\\n\\nAgain, using modulus 20 to wrap around if necessary:\\n\\n8 mod 20 = 8\\n\\nThis result indicates that we have moved 8 positions from the start, which is the same position as the starting point, the beaker.
