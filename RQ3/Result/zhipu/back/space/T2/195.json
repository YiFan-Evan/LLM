When you move past the last item (the 20th item, vacuum cleaner in this case) and continue in a clockwise direction, you wrap around to the first item (Bedlington Terrier).

Finally, moving 16 steps clockwise from the Eastern diamondback rattlesnake:\\n   - Eastern diamondback rattlesnake -> Bald eagle -> Jay -> Spider web -> Tiger shark -> Sock -> Movie theater -> Plectrum -> Broccoli -> Odometer -> Mixing bowl -> Bikini -> Speaker -> Vacuum cleaner -> Bedlington Terrier -> Manhole cover -> Bell-cot -> Shopping cart -> Tibetan Terrier -> Sundial -> Eastern diamondback rattlesnake -> Bald eagle\\n   - This is equivalent to 16 steps to the right from the Eastern diamondback rattlesnake.\\n   - Eastern diamondback rattlesnake -> Bald eagle -> Jay\\n\\nAfter all these movements, we end up at the Jay.
