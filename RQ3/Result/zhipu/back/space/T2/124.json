Each movement is essentially a shift around the circle, and since the circle is closed, once we pass the last dot, we loop back to the first dot.\\n\\nGiven that there are 20 dots on the path, moving 5 steps clockwise from the European polecat will bring us to the yawl. Then, moving 18 steps clockwise from the yawl will bring us to the toy terrier. Moving another 18 steps from the toy terrier will bring us to the military aircraft. Finally, moving 5 steps from the military aircraft will bring us to the common squirrel monkey.\\n\\nHowever, since the path is circular, we need to consider the total number of steps taken and see if it exceeds the number of dots on the path. If it does, we would loop around and start again from the first dot.\\n\\nLet's calculate the total steps taken:\\nFirst movement: 5 steps from the European polecat\\nSecond movement: 18 steps from the yawl\\nThird movement: 18 steps from the toy terrier\\nFourth movement: 5 steps from the military aircraft\\n\\nTotal steps = 5 + 18 + 18 + 5 = 46 steps\\n\\nSince there are only 20 dots on the path, we need to find the remainder when 46 is divided by 20 to determine our final position. This is because every full loop of 20 steps brings us back to the starting point.\\n\\n46 % 20 = 6\\n\\nThis means we have moved 6 steps past the starting point after completing 2 full loops (40 steps).
