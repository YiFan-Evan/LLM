In modular arithmetic, we consider the remainder after division by the total number of positions (which is 20 in this case).

Moving 14 steps in a clockwise direction from position 15 would bring us to position 29, but since there are only 20 positions, we wrap around using modular arithmetic: 29 mod 20 = 9.\\n3.
