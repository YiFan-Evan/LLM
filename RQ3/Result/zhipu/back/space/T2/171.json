The total number of dots (or positions) is 20, so each movement can be thought of as adding or subtracting a certain number from your current position, with positions wrapping around after reaching the end or the beginning of the path.\\n\\nLet's start at the orangutan and follow the movements:\\n\\n1. Move 18 steps counter-clockwise: 18 positions back from the orangutan.\\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise: 2 positions forward from the previous position.\\n3.
