Each movement is effectively an offset from our current position. Since the map is circular with 20 dots, moving 20 steps in either direction would bring us back to the starting point.\\n\\nLet's break down the movements:\\n\\n1. Starting at the snow leopard, move 9 steps counter-clockwise.\\n2. Then, move 3 steps clockwise.\\n3. Next, move 7 steps counter-clockwise.\\n4. Finally, move 6 steps clockwise.\\n\\nTo find the final position, we can sum these movements. Since moving clockwise is effectively a positive step and moving counter-clockwise is a negative step, we can add these values together:\\n\\n9 (counter-clockwise) - 3 (clockwise) - 7 (counter-clockwise) + 6 (clockwise) = -3 steps.\\n\\nThis result means we end up 3 steps before the snow leopard when moving in a counter-clockwise direction. Since there are 20 items and we move in a circular path, we can determine the item by counting 3 steps back from the snow leopard in the list provided:\\n\\nSnow Leopard (starting point), mud turtle, tractor.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: tractor.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
