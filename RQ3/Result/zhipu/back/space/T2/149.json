This means we move forward 15 dots on the map.\\n\\nSince the path has 20 dots, moving 15 steps in either direction will not complete a full circle (which would be 20 steps).

We must account for the fact that moving 15 steps clockwise from the goldfinch and then 15 steps counter-clockwise does not bring us back to the goldfinch because we are effectively making a full circle minus the steps we took in the opposite direction after the first movement. Since 15 + 15 = 30, and 30 is more than the total number of dots (20), we must subtract the total number of dots from the net steps taken (30 - 20 = 10 steps in this case).\\n\\nThis means we have moved 10 steps clockwise from the goldfinch after accounting for the full circle. Counting 10 steps clockwise from the goldfinch, we pass the American black bear, the torch, the dung beetle, the tile roof, the wooden spoon, and end up at the black swan.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: black swan.\""}]
