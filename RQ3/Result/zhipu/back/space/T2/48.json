Since the path is circular and has 10 connected dots, we can think of each dot as a position, and we can use modular arithmetic to determine our final position after the movements described.\\n\\nHere's how we can approach it:\\n\\n1. Start at the position of the goldfinch (which we can consider as position 1).\\n2. Move 2 steps clockwise. Since we're moving clockwise, we add 2 to our current position. However, because the path is circular, we need to use modulo 10 arithmetic to wrap around if we exceed 10. So, (1 + 2) mod 10 = 3. We are now at position 3.\\n3. Move 9 steps clockwise. We add 9 to our current position of 3, which gives us 12. Using modulo 10, (12 mod 10) = 2. We are now at position 2.\\n4. Move 7 steps counter-clockwise. Moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to subtracting steps from our current position. We subtract 7 from our current position of 2, which gives us -5. Using modulo 10, (-5 mod 10) = 5 (because -5 + 10 = 5). We are now at position 5.\\n\\nNow we just need to identify the item located at position 5 on the circular path.
