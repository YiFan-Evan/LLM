However, unlike the previous scenario where we moved counter-clockwise, moving clockwise will not return us to the starting point immediately. Instead, we need to find the position 40 steps clockwise from the breakwater.\\n\\nTo do this, we can calculate the position by taking the total steps moved (40) modulo the number of dots on the path (20):\\n40 % 20 = 0.\\n\\nA result of 0 means that after moving 40 steps clockwise, we would end up at the starting point of the 40 steps, which is the breakwater itself. However, since we are moving from the breakwater and not the starting point (confectionery store), we need to count 40 steps from the breakwater.\\n\\nSince we have a total of 20 items, we can simplify the calculation by using modulo:\\n(7 + 10 + 18 + 5) % 20 = 40 % 20 = 0.\\n\\nBut since we start from the breakwater, we must count the steps from that point. The breakwater is the 7th item from the confectionery store when moving clockwise. So we need to add the 7 steps to the breakwater's position to find the final item:\\n\\n(7 + 7 + 10 + 18 + 5) % 20 = (7 + 40) % 20 = 47 % 20 = 7.\\n\\nThe result of 7 tells us that we end up 7 items clockwise from the confectionery store, which is the position of the \\\"Boston Terrier\\\".\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: Boston Terrier.\""}]
