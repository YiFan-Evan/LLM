We start at the Airedale Terrier and move around the ring by a certain number of steps. \\n\\nSince there are 5 connected dots on the path, moving 5 steps in a clockwise direction will bring us back to the starting point. This means that every multiple of 5 steps will also bring us back to the starting point. \\n\\nWe are told to move 3 steps clockwise from the Airedale Terrier, which lands us on the third item on the list. Then we are told to move 5 steps clockwise, which brings us back to the starting point (the Airedale Terrier) since 5 steps is a multiple of the total number of dots (5).\\n\\nSo the sequence of items as we move clockwise is:\\n1. Airedale Terrier\\n2. Mop\\n3. Prairie Grouse\\n4. Ibizan Hound\\n5. Acoustic Guitar (starting point)\\n\\nMoving 3 steps from the Airedale Terrier, we reach the mop.
