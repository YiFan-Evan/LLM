If you move from one dot to the next in a clockwise direction, you are moving to the next position on the path.\\n\\n2. When moving in a counter-clockwise direction, you are moving to the previous position on the path.\\n\\n3. Each movement described changes your position by a certain number of steps. If you exceed the number of dots, you wrap around to the beginning or end of the path because it's circular.\\n\\n4. We start at the position of the dragonfly, not the espresso machine, as stated in the problem.\\n\\nNow let's calculate the final position:\\n\\n- Move 7 steps counter-clockwise from the dragonfly.

This takes us past the crossword, the triceratops, the home theater, and lands us on the water buffalo.\\n- Move 2 steps counter-clockwise from the water buffalo.
