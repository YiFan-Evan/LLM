This means that moving 20 steps clockwise or counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 0 steps (or 20 steps, as it's the same position).\\n\\nTo find the final position, we can sum up all the movements in terms of the number of dots and then take the result modulo 20 (since there are 20 dots and the path is circular).
