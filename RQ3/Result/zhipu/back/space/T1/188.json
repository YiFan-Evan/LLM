We start at the flamingo and move 8 steps clockwise, then from that new position, we move another 12 steps clockwise. Since the map is circular, we can use modular arithmetic to determine our final position without having to count each step individually.\\n\\nFirst, we find the position after the first movement of 8 steps. Since there are 20 items on the map, we can calculate the new position using the modulo operation:\\n\\nInitial position (starting at the flamingo) + steps moved = new position (mod number of items on the map)\\nFlamingo (position 3) + 8 steps = new position (mod 20)\\n\\nNow, we calculate the new position:\\n3 + 8 = 11\\n\\nSo after the first movement, we are at the position of the 11th item on the map, which is the space bar.\\n\\nNext, we move 12 steps from the space bar in a clockwise direction:\\nSpace bar (position 11) + 12 steps = new position (mod 20)\\n\\nCalculating the new position:\\n11 + 12 = 23\\n\\nSince there are only 20 items on the map, we use the modulo operation to find the position equivalent to 23 on a 20-item map:\\n23 mod 20 = 3\\n\\nSo the position 23 is equivalent to position 3 on the circular map.

Then, moving one step counter-clockwise will bring us back to the flamingo. From there, we move eight steps clockwise, which will take us to the position of the golf ball. Finally, moving 12 steps clockwise from the golf ball will determine our final position.\\n\\nLet's calculate the final position after all movements:\\n\\n1. Flamingo (position 3) + 1 step clockwise = Angora rabbit (position 4)\\n2. Angora rabbit (position 4) - 1 step counter-clockwise = Flamingo (position 3)\\n3.
