The circular path consists of 20 connected dots, which means that if you move 20 steps in one direction, you will end up back at your starting point.\\n\\nWhen moving in a counter-clockwise direction from the common redshank, we need to calculate the total number of steps taken and then determine the position on the circle based on those steps. Since the problem specifies moving 16 steps and then 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, we add these steps together to find the total number of steps moved.\\n\\nTotal steps moved = 16 steps + 20 steps = 36 steps\\n\\nBecause the path is circular and has 20 dots, we can find the equivalent position by taking the total steps and finding the remainder when divided by the number of dots. This is because every time you complete a full circle (20 steps), you end up at the starting point again.\\n\\n36 steps % 20 dots = 16 (remainder)\\n\\nThis means that after moving 36 steps counter-clockwise, you will be 16 dots away from the starting point of the common redshank.
