This brings us to the (18 % 20)th item from the sunscreen, which is the same as the 18th item because 18 modulo 20 is 18.\\n2. Then, we move 9 steps clockwise. This brings us to the (18 + 9) % 20th item, which is the 27th item counted from the sunscreen, but since we are on a circular path, we take 27 modulo 20 to find the position, which is 7.\\n3. Next, we move 14 steps counter-clockwise. Moving backward is the same as moving forward in the circle, so we subtract 14 from our current position and take the modulo 20 of the result. The new position is (7 - 14 + 20) % 20, which simplifies to (13) % 20, which is 13.\\n4. Finally, we move 13 steps clockwise.
