The circular path has 20 dots, which means that moving from one dot to the next is considered one step. When moving around a circle, if you move past the last dot, you wrap around to the first dot again.\\n\\nThe steps can be summed up to find the final position. Since the path is circular, we can use modular arithmetic to find the position after each movement. The total number of steps moved clockwise is 15 + 7 + 15 = 37 steps, and the total number of steps moved counter-clockwise is 19. Since the path has 20 dots, we can find the final position by taking the total clockwise steps minus the total counter-clockwise steps and then taking that result modulo 20 (to account for the circular nature of the path).\\n\\nSo, the calculation is:\\n(37 steps clockwise - 19 steps counter-clockwise) mod 20 = (37 - 19) mod 20 = 18 mod 20 = 18\\n\\nSince the starting point is the Asian elephant, we count 18 items clockwise from the Asian elephant to find the final item.\\n\\nStarting from the Asian elephant and moving 18 steps clockwise, we pass the nematode, ambulance, minibus, rocking chair, catamaran, Christmas stocking, tow truck, Gordon Setter, Scottish Terrier, poke bonnet, shield, chameleon, husky, and goldfinch, which makes 14 items. We then move past the Dobermann, which is the 15th item, and finally, we reach the Band-Aid, which is the 16th item.
