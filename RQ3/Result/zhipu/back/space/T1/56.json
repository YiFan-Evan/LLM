We start at the upright piano and then follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Move 6 steps counter-clockwise.\\n2. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise.\\n3. Move 4 steps clockwise.\\n\\nFirst, we need to understand that moving counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving clockwise in the opposite direction, so we can convert these movements to a single direction for easier calculation. Since there are 10 dots on the circular path, we can think of the path as having 10 positions.\\n\\nStarting at the upright piano (which we'll consider as position 0), the movements can be calculated as follows:\\n\\n- Moving 6 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 4 steps clockwise (because 10 - 6 = 4).\\n- Then, moving 3 steps counter-clockwise is the same as moving 7 steps clockwise (because 10 - 3 = 7).\\n- Finally, we move 4 steps clockwise.\\n\\nNow, we add up the movements in the clockwise direction: 4 (from the first move) + 7 (from the second move) + 4 (from the third move) = 15 steps clockwise.\\n\\nSince the path is circular with 10 positions, we need to find the remainder of the total steps taken when divided by 10 (as moving 10 steps would bring us back to the starting point). \\n\\n15 steps divided by 10 gives us a remainder of 5 (because 15 = 1 * 10 + 5).\\n\\nTherefore, after the movements, we end up 5 steps clockwise from the upright piano.
