Move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction.\\n3. Move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.\\n\\nSince the path is circular and has 10 dots, each step moves us from one dot to the next. Clockwise movements will take us from the current position to the next dot in the sequence, while counter-clockwise movements will take us from the current position to the previous dot in the sequence.\\n\\nStarting from the chiton and moving 8 steps clockwise will take us to the honeycomb (since the chiton is the 6th item on the list, and adding 8 to 6 gives us 14, but since the list is circular with 10 items, we subtract 10 from 14 to find the position relative to the list: 14 - 10 = 4, which is the honeycomb, as it is the 4th item on the list).\\n\\nFrom the honeycomb, we move 4 steps clockwise, which takes us to the ringlet (honeycomb is the 4th item, adding 4 steps gives us 8, which is the position of the ringlet).\\n\\nFinally, we move 4 steps counter-clockwise from the ringlet.
