Since the path is circular and consists of 5 connected dots, a single step clockwise from the starting position (Carolina anole) will take us to the next item in the sequence, which is the brown bear. Moving one step counter-clockwise will take us back to the previous item in the sequence, which is also the brown bear, because we are moving from the top directly to the left side of the circle.\\n\\nNow, after moving one step clockwise and one step counter-clockwise, we are back at the starting position, the Carolina anole. Next, we need to move 5 steps counter-clockwise. As established earlier, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise brings us back to the starting position, which is the Carolina anole.\\n\\nSince the clockwise and counter-clockwise movements cancel each other out and the subsequent 5 steps counter-clockwise also bring us back to the starting position, the net movement is zero.
