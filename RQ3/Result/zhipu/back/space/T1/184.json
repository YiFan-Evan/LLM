Starting from the ski mask, you move around the ring by 13 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 13 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.

The map is circular, with 20 items spaced evenly around it. When moving around the circle, if you reach the end and continue past the last item, you loop back to the beginning. Similarly, if you move in the counter-clockwise direction, you can loop back to the end of the list.\\n\\nTo find the item after a series of movements, we can calculate the total number of steps moved in a clockwise direction and subtract the total number of steps moved in a counter-clockwise direction. This will give us the net movement around the circle. Since the circle has 20 dots, any movement that is a multiple of 20 will bring us back to the starting point. We then need to determine the position relative to the starting point (the ski mask in this case) after the net movement.\\n\\nLet's calculate the net movement:\\n\\nClockwise movements: 13 + 10 + 5 = 28 steps\\nCounter-clockwise movements: 13 steps\\n\\nNet clockwise movement: 28 - 13 = 15 steps\\n\\nSince the circle has 20 dots, we can find the final position by taking the net movement modulo 20 (which gives us the remainder after division):\\n\\n15 mod 20 = 15\\n\\nThis means we have moved 15 steps past the ski mask in a clockwise direction.
