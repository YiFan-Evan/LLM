Since the path is circular and consists of 20 connected dots, we can think of each dot as a position number from 1 to 20, with the top of the path being position 1. \\n\\nWhen moving clockwise, we add the number of steps to our current position. When moving counter-clockwise, we subtract the number of steps from our current position. However, since the path is circular, we need to account for wrapping around. This means that if we move past position 20 clockwise or before position 1 counter-clockwise, we wrap around to the beginning or end of the list, respectively.\\n\\nWe start at the Golden Retriever. Since the Golden Retriever is not the first item listed, we need to determine its position number. We count the items from the top of the path (the swing) to the Golden Retriever:\\n\\n1. Swing\\n2.

We are now at position 13, which is the projector.\\n3. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise from position 13: 13 - 13 = 0. Since we can't have a position of 0, we add 20 to wrap around: 0 + 20 = 20. We are now at position 20, which is the lab coat.\\n4. Move 18 steps counter-clockwise from position 20: 20 - 18 = 2.
