Moving 1 step counter-clockwise from the airship will take us back to the monitor.\\n3. Moving 12 steps clockwise from the monitor will take us 12 positions forward. Since there are 20 dots, we can find the new position by adding 12 to the current position (which is the 19th position, as the monitor is the 18th item before the airship). 19 + 12 = 31, but since the path is circular, we subtract 20 (the total number of dots) from 31 to find the position, which is 11. The 11th item on the list is the Wire Fox Terrier.\\n4. Moving 12 steps counter-clockwise from the Wire Fox Terrier will take us 12 positions backward. We can find the new position by subtracting 12 from the current position (11). 11 - 12 = -1, but since we can't have a negative position on a circular path, we add 20 to -1 to find the position, which is 19.
