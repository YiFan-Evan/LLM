Since the path is circular and consists of 10 connected dots, we can consider each dot as a position and the movement as adding or subtracting from this position.\\n\\n1. Starting from the horizontal bar, moving 7 steps clockwise will land us on the next item after the Golden Retriever because we move past the screw, the horizontal bar, the stupa, the computer mouse, the pufferfish, the sea slug, the milk can, and the Golden Retriever itself, ending on the nematode.\\n\\n2. Then, we move 9 steps counter-clockwise, which is essentially moving clockwise by 1 step (since 10 steps would bring us back to the starting point, and 9 is one less than 10). Moving 1 step clockwise from the nematode, we land on the Golden Retriever.\\n\\n3. Finally, we move 3 steps clockwise from the Golden Retriever, which takes us past the milk can to the sea slug.\\n\\nNow we add up the movements:\\n\\n- 7 steps clockwise from the horizontal bar to the nematode\\n- 1 step clockwise from the nematode to the Golden Retriever (after moving 9 steps counter-clockwise)\\n- 3 steps clockwise from the Golden Retriever to the sea slug\\n\\nThis gives us a net movement of 7 + 1 + 3 = 11 steps clockwise.
