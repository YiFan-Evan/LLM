Therefore, to find the final position after a series of movements, we can calculate the net movement by summing all the steps and then taking the result modulo the number of dots (20 in this case). If the result is positive, it indicates the number of steps clockwise from the starting point; if negative, it indicates the number of steps counter-clockwise.\\n\\nLet's calculate the net movement:\\n\\n1. Move around the ring by 13 steps clockwise.\\n2. Move around the ring by 3 steps clockwise.\\n3. Move around the ring by 3 steps clockwise.\\n4. Move around the ring by 12 steps counter-clockwise.\\n\\nNet movement = (13 + 3 + 3) - 12 = 19 - 12 = 7 steps clockwise.\\n\\nNow, we need to find the item located 7 steps clockwise from the snoek on the list provided.\\n\\nStarting from the snoek, moving 7 steps clockwise, we pass the following items:\\n\\n1. snoek\\n2. lionfish\\n3. peacock\\n4.
