Each step in either direction moves us from one dot to the next dot on the circular path.\\n\\nGiven that the path has 10 connected dots, we can think of each dot as a position number from 1 to 10, with the carousel being at position 1. When moving around the circle, if we reach the end (dot 10) and continue, we loop back to dot 1.\\n\\nLet's calculate the position after each movement:\\n\\n1. Starting at the limousine (we don't know its position number yet).\\n2. Move 9 steps counter-clockwise: this is equivalent to moving 9 steps backward. If we do this from any position, we will end up at a position that is 9 less than our starting position, considering that if we go below position 1, we loop back to position 10.\\n3. Move 7 steps clockwise: this is equivalent to moving 7 steps forward. We add 7 to our new position from step 2.\\n4. Move 6 steps clockwise: we add another 6 to our position from step 3.\\n\\nNow, let's find the position of the limousine first. Since there are 10 items and the carousel is at the top (position 1), we can count the items in a clockwise direction to find the limousine's position:\\n\\n1. Carousel\\n2. Macaque\\n3. Keeshond\\n4. Crane (bird)\\n5. Black grouse\\n6. Limousine (this is at position 6)\\n\\nStarting from position 6, we move 9 steps counter-clockwise, which takes us to position 6 - 9 = -3. Since we can't have a negative position number on a circular path, we add 10 to loop back around, giving us position 7 (counter-clockwise from position 6).\\n\\nFrom position 7, we move 7 steps clockwise, which takes us to position 7 + 7 = 14. Again, since there are only 10 positions, we subtract 10 from 14 to loop back around, giving us position 4.\\n\\nFrom position 4, we move 6 steps clockwise, which takes us to position 4 + 6 = 10.\\n\\nNow we look at the item at position 10, which is the last position on the path:\\n\\n1. Carousel\\n2. Macaque\\n3. Keeshond\\n4. Crane (bird)\\n5. Black grouse\\n6. Limousine\\n7. Soccer ball\\n8. Miniature Poodle\\n9. Baboon\\n10.
