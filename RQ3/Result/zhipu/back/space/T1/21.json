We start at the hoop skirt and move 3 steps clockwise, then 4 more steps clockwise.\\n\\nSince we have 5 items on the circular path, every time we move 5 steps, we return to the starting point (the hoop skirt in this case). This means that the position after moving any number of steps will be the same as the position after moving the same number of steps modulo 5 (using the modulo operation to find the remainder after division by the number of items).\\n\\nStarting at the hoop skirt (which we'll consider as position 1), we move 3 steps to the right:\\n\\n1. Hoop skirt (starting position)\\n2. Next item (moving 1 step)\\n3. Next item (moving 2 steps)\\n4. Next item (moving 3 steps)\\n\\nAfter 3 steps, we are at the position of the item following the hoop skirt.\\n\\nNext, we move 4 more steps to the right:\\n\\n5. Next item (moving 1 step from the previous position)\\n6. Next item (moving 2 steps from the previous position)\\n7. Next item (moving 3 steps from the previous position)\\n8. Next item (moving 4 steps from the previous position)\\n\\nAdding the 3 initial steps to the 4 additional steps gives us 7 steps in total. To find out where we end up after 7 steps from the hoop skirt, we take 7 modulo 5:\\n\\n7 % 5 = 2\\n\\nThis means we are 2 positions away from the hoop skirt in a clockwise direction. Since we count the hoop skirt as position 1, we only need to count two more positions to find out where we are:\\n\\n1. Hoop skirt (position 1)\\n2.
