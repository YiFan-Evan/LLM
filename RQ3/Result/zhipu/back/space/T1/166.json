Since the map is circular and has 20 dots, each step we take moves us from one dot to the next. When we move a certain number of steps in either direction, we can calculate our new position by adding or subtracting that number from our current position, and then taking the modulus with the total number of dots (20) to account for the circular nature of the map.\\n\\nHere's the sequence of movements and how to calculate the position after each one:\\n\\n1. Start at the Maltese (position is not given, so we'll consider it as the starting point, which we'll call position 0).\\n2. Move 3 steps counter-clockwise: 0 - 3 = -3. Since we can't have a negative position on a circular map with 20 dots, we add 20 to bring it back into the positive range: -3 + 20 = 17 (we end up 17 positions from the starting point).\\n3. Move 19 steps clockwise: 17 + 19 = 36. Since 36 is greater than 20, we subtract 20 from it to find the position on the map: 36 - 20 = 16 (we end up 16 positions from the starting point).\\n4. Move 13 steps counter-clockwise: 16 - 13 = 3 (we end up 3 positions from the starting point).\\n5. Move 9 steps clockwise: 3 + 9 = 12 (we end up 12 positions from the starting point).\\n\\nNow we need to identify the item at the 12th position from the Maltese on the list provided.
