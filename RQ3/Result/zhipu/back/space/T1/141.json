Since the path is circular, we can think of it as a sequence with a repeating pattern where each item has a fixed position. We start at the tent, which is not the top of the path but one step to the right of the face powder.\\n\\nFirst, we move 2 steps counter-clockwise from the tent. This means we move to the left. Since we're moving counter-clockwise, we subtract 2 from our current position. The tent is at position 2 (since the face powder is at position 1), so moving 2 steps to the left would take us to position 0, but since the path is circular, we wrap around to position 20. Since there are only 20 items, we count 20 as the last position (the rugby ball).\\n\\nSecond, we move 5 steps clockwise from our new position. Moving clockwise, we add 5 to our current position. From position 20, adding 5 steps would take us to position 25, but since the path is circular with only 20 positions, we wrap around and only count 5 positions past 20, landing us at position 5, which is the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier.\\n\\nThird, we move 9 steps clockwise from position 5. Adding 9 to 5 gives us position 14, which is the mountain bike.\\n\\nFinally, we move 8 steps counter-clockwise from position 14.
