Move 8 steps counter-clockwise from the dugong. This takes us to the position of the honeycomb (since we are moving backwards, we subtract 8 from 13):\\n   13 (dugong) - 8 = 5 (honeycomb)\\n\\n2. Move 2 steps counter-clockwise from the honeycomb:\\n   5 (honeycomb) - 2 = 3 (grasshopper)\\n\\n3. Move 5 steps clockwise from the grasshopper:\\n   3 (grasshopper) + 5 = 8 (ice cream)\\n\\n4.
