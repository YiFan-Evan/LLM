This technique is useful when we have a composition of functions, which in this case is sin and ln(x).\\n\\nLet's use u-substitution. We'll set u = ln(x), which means that du/dx = 1/x. Therefore, dx = x du, but since u = ln(x), we can also say that e^u = x, and thus dx = e^u du.\\n\\nThe integral now becomes:\\n\\n\u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = \u222b sin(u) e^u du\\n\\nThis is a bit tricky because we don't have a straightforward integral for sin(u)e^u. However, this is a standard integral that can be solved using integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the product rule of differentiation and is expressed by the formula:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nLet's set u = sin(u) and dv = e^u du. Then, we need to find du and v. Taking the derivative of u gives us du = cos(u) du, and integrating dv gives us v = e^u.\\n\\nApplying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) e^u du = sin(u)e^u - \u222b cos(u)e^u du\\n\\nNow, we need to integrate \u222b cos(u)e^u du, which we can again do using integration by parts. Let's set u = cos(u) and dv = e^u du. Then, du = -sin(u) du and v = e^u.\\n\\n\u222b cos(u)e^u du = cos(u)e^u - \u222b (-sin(u)e^u) du\\n                = cos(u)e^u + \u222b sin(u)e^u du\\n\\nNow, we have the same integral on both sides of the equation, which suggests that we can solve for it:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u)e^u du = sin(u)e^u - (cos(u)e^u + \u222b sin(u)e^u du)\\n\\nLet's isolate the integral:\\n\\n2\u222b sin(u)e^u du = sin(u)e^u - cos(u)e^u\\n\\nNow, divide both sides by 2:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u)e^u du = (1/2)[sin(u)e^u - cos(u)e^u]\\n\\nNow we can substitute back u = ln(x):\\n\\n\u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = (1/2)[sin(ln(x))e^ln(x) - cos(ln(x))e^ln(x)] + C\\n\\nSince e^ln(x) = x, the integral simplifies to:\\n\\n\u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = (1/2)[xsin(ln(x)) - xcos(ln(x))] + C\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n(1/2)[4sin(ln(4)) - 4cos(ln(4))]\\n\\nWe now need to calculate sin(ln(4)) and cos(ln(4)) and then substitute these values into the expression above.
