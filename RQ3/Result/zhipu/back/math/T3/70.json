Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nwhere u and dv are chosen such that du and v are easier to integrate than u and dv. A common heuristic is to choose u as the function that simplifies when differentiated and dv as the function that simplifies when integrated.\\n\\nFor the function cos(x)*sinh(x), we can choose:\\n\\nu = cos(x) then du = -sin(x) dx\\ndv = sinh(x) dx then v = cosh(x)\\n\\nApplying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x)*sinh(x) dx = cos(x)*cosh(x) - \u222b cosh(x)*(-sin(x)) dx\\n\u222b cos(x)*sinh(x) dx = cos(x)*cosh(x) + \u222b sin(x)*cosh(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we need to perform integration by parts again on the new integral \u222b sin(x)*cosh(x) dx.
