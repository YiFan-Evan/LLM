We can set u = 1/x and dv = e^x dx again, which will give us du = -1/x^2 dx and v = e^x. However, we'll notice that we're getting into an infinite loop because we'll end up with the same integral we started with.\\n\\nTo resolve this, we'll integrate e^x/x once more using integration by parts, and we'll recognize that we'll get an exponential function times a logarithmic function as a result. Let's perform the integration by parts one more time:\\n\\nLet u = 1/x and dv = e^x dx.\\ndu = -1/x^2 dx\\nv = e^x\\n\\nApplying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)*e^x dx = (1/x)*e^x - \u222be^x*(-1/x^2) dx\\n                 = (1/x)*e^x + \u222be^x/x^2 dx\\n\\nNow, for the integral \u222be^x/x^2 dx, we can use substitution. Let's set u = x^(-2), so du = -2x^(-3) dx or dx = -1/(2x^3) du. However, this substitution doesn't simplify the problem; instead, we can notice that the derivative of e^x/x is e^x/x - e^x/x^2, which suggests that the antiderivative of (1/x)*e^x is e^x/x. This is because the derivative of e^x/x with respect to x includes the term e^x/x^2, which is what we have in our integral.\\n\\nSo we can conclude that:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x)*e^x dx = e^x/x + C\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into our result:\\n\\ne^4/4\\n\\nSince we're asked for the integer result by rounding down, we can ignore the fractional part and just consider the integer part of e^4/4. \\n\\nUsing a calculator to approximate e^4, we get approximately 54.598.
