The integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals.\\n\\nLet's start with the first term, sin(cos(x)). As with the previous function, we'll use a substitution to integrate this term. Let u = cos(x), then du = -sin(x)dx, or dx = -du/sin(x). The integral of sin(cos(x)) remains the same as before:\\n\\n\u222b sin(cos(x)) dx = -cos(u) + C\\n                   = -cos(cos(x)) + C\\n\\nNow, for the second term, x, the integral is straightforward.
