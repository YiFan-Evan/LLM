However, cos(ln(x)) is not a standard function that we can integrate directly, so we need to use a combination of both techniques.\\n\\nLet's use integration by parts. We'll set u = cos(ln(x)) and dv = dx. Then we'll need to find du and v.\\n\\nFirst, let's find du:\\ndu/dx = -sin(ln(x)) * (1/x) by the chain rule\\ndu = -sin(ln(x)) * (1/x) dx\\n\\nNext, let's find v:\\nSince dv = dx, we integrate with respect to x to find v:\\nv = \u222b dv = \u222b dx = x\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nPlugging in our u, dv, du, and v, we get:\\n\u222b cos(ln(x)) dx = x * cos(ln(x)) - \u222b x * (-sin(ln(x)) * (1/x)) dx\\n\\nSimplifying the integral on the right:\\n\u222b cos(ln(x)) dx = x * cos(ln(x)) + \u222b sin(ln(x)) dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate sin(ln(x)). This is a bit more complex, so we'll use another substitution. Let's set u = ln(x), so du = (1/x) dx, and rewrite the integral in terms of u:\\n\u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = \u222b sin(u) du\\n\\nWe know that the integral of sin(u) is -cos(u) + C, so we substitute back to get:\\n\u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = -cos(u) + C\\n\u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = -cos(ln(x)) + C\\n\\nNow we substitute back into our original equation:\\n\u222b cos(ln(x)) dx = x * cos(ln(x)) - (-cos(ln(x)) + C)\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\u222b cos(ln(x)) dx = x * cos(ln(x)) + cos(ln(x)) + C\\n\u222b cos(ln(x)) dx = cos(ln(x)) * (x + 1) + C\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this expression at x = 4:\\ncos(ln(4)) * (4 + 1) + C\\ncos(ln(4)) * 5 + C\\n\\nSince we're not including the constant C and we're asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we don't need to worry about the constant.

The integral of cos(ln(x)) can be found using integration by parts, as explained in the previous answer. The result is cos(ln(x)) * (x + 1) + C1, where C1 is the constant of integration for this term.\\n\\n2. The integral of x is straightforward since it's a basic polynomial.
