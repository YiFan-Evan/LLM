Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions and is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nwhere u and dv are chosen parts of the integrand. A common heuristic is to use the LIATE rule (Logarithmic, Inverse trigonometric, Algebraic, Trigonometric, Exponential) for choosing u and dv, where we should choose u to be the part that will become simpler when differentiated and dv to be the part that is easy to integrate.\\n\\nFor the function ln(x) * sin(x), let's choose:\\n\\nu = ln(x) because its derivative (1/x) is simpler than the original function.\\ndv = sin(x)dx because it is easy to integrate.\\n\\nNow we find du and v:\\n\\ndu = (1/x)dx\\nv = \u222b sin(x)dx = -cos(x)\\n\\nApplying the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) * sin(x) dx = u * v - \u222b v * du\\n\u222b ln(x) * sin(x) dx = ln(x) * (-cos(x)) - \u222b (-cos(x)) * (1/x)dx\\n\u222b ln(x) * sin(x) dx = -ln(x) * cos(x) + \u222b cos(x) / x dx\\n\\nThe integral \u222b cos(x) / x dx does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, so we'll leave it as is for now.
