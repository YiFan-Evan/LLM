Integration by parts is based on the product rule for derivatives and is expressed by the formula:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nwhere u and dv are chosen parts of the integrand. A common heuristic for choosing u and dv is to use the LIATE rule (Logarithmic, Inverse trigonometric, Algebraic, Trigonometric, Exponential), where we try to differentiate the logarithmic or inverse trigonometric functions and integrate the algebraic or exponential functions.\\n\\nIn our case, we have a product of a logarithmic function (ln(x)) and an algebraic function (1 + x).
