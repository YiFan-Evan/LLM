The given function can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(1/x) / (x(1+x)) + x = 1 / (x^2(1+x)) + x\\n\\nNow, we integrate this expression in two parts. The first part is the integral of 1/(x^2(1+x)), and the second part is the integral of x.\\n\\nFor the first part, we can use partial fraction decomposition, but it's not necessary for this particular integral because we can split it into two simpler fractions:\\n\\n\u222b 1/(x^2(1+x)) dx = \u222b (1/x^2 - 1/(1+x)) dx\\n\\nThe integral of 1/x^2 is -1/x, and the integral of -1/(1+x) is -ln|1+x|.
