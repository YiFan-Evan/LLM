Integration by parts is typically used when the integral involves a product of functions, and in this case, we can think of cos(ln(x)) as a product where one function is cos(u) and the other is d(v), where u = ln(x) and v = 1 (since the derivative of x with respect to x is 1).\\n\\nThe formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's set u = cos(ln(x)) and dv = dx.
