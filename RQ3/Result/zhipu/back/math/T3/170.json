Instead, we'll use the fact that \\\\( \\\\sinh(x) = \\\\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} \\\\) and integrate term by term.\\n\\nLet's rewrite the integral:\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\sinh(x) \\\\cdot \\\\sin(x) dx = \\\\int \\\\left( \\\\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{2} \\\\right) \\\\sin(x) dx \\\\]\\n\\nNow we can integrate each term separately.
