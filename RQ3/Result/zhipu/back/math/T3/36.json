The general formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nFor the natural logarithm function, we can let u = ln(x) and dv = dx. Then, we need to find du and v. The derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, so du = 1/x dx. Integrating dv = dx gives us v = x.\\n\\nApplying the integration by parts formula, we get:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) dx = x * ln(x) - \u222bx * (1/x) dx\\n             = x * ln(x) - \u222b1 dx\\n             = x * ln(x) - x + C\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n4 * ln(4) - 4\\n\\nTo find the exact value, we calculate ln(4). Since 4 is 2 squared, we can say that ln(4) is ln(2^2), which is 2 * ln(2).
