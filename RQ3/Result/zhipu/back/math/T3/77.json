We can split this into two separate terms:\\n\\n\u222b (1+x)/ln(x) dx = \u222b 1/ln(x) dx + \u222b x/ln(x) dx\\n\\nFor the first term, \u222b 1/ln(x) dx, this is a special case that results in the logarithmic integral function, Li(x), which we will leave as an antiderivative since we are interested in a numerical result after substitution.\\n\\nFor the second term, \u222b x/ln(x) dx, we can use the substitution method as before. Let u = ln(x), so du = 1/x dx. Then the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b x/ln(x) dx = \u222b x * (1/u) du = \u222b u du = u^2/2 + C = (ln(x))^2/2 + C\\n\\nNow let's integrate the second term of the original function, which is simply x:\\n\\n\u222b x dx = x^2/2 + C\\n\\nNow we combine the results of the two integrals:\\n\\n\u222b (1+x)/ln(x) dx + \u222b x dx = Li(x) + (ln(x))^2/2 + x^2/2 + C\\n\\nNext, we substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\nLi(4) + (ln(4))^2/2 + (4^2)/2\\n\\nWe already know from the previous explanation that (ln(4))^2/2 is approximately 3.178309873684582.
