The product rule states that the derivative of the product of two functions \\\\( u(x) \\\\) and \\\\( v(x) \\\\) is \\\\( u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x) \\\\). The integration by parts formula is derived from this rule and is as follows:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int u \\\\, dv = uv - \\\\int v \\\\, du \\\\]\\n\\nFor the function \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln(x)} \\\\), we can choose \\\\( u = \\\\ln(x) \\\\) and \\\\( dv = \\\\frac{1}{x}dx \\\\), because the derivative of \\\\( \\\\ln(x) \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\) and the integral of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{x}dx \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\ln|x| \\\\). However, this choice will not simplify the integral as we desire since it will lead us back to the original function.\\n\\nInstead, we'll use the fact that \\\\( \\\\frac{d}{dx} \\\\ln(\\\\ln(x)) = \\\\frac{1}{x \\\\ln(x)} \\\\). This suggests that the integral of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln(x)} \\\\) is related to the natural logarithm of the natural logarithm of x. Specifically:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln(x)}dx = \\\\ln|\\\\ln(x)| + C \\\\]\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute \\\\( x = 4 \\\\) into the result:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\ln|\\\\ln(4)| \\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\( \\\\ln(4) \\\\) is positive, we can ignore the absolute value:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\ln(\\\\ln(4)) \\\\]\\n\\nNow, we calculate \\\\( \\\\ln(4) \\\\) which is approximately \\\\( \\\\ln(2^2) = 2\\\\ln(2) \\\\approx 2 \\\\cdot 0.693 = 1.386 \\\\).\\n\\nTherefore, \\\\( \\\\ln(\\\\ln(4)) \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\ln(1.386) \\\\), which is approximately 0.329.\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, the final answer is 0, because 0.329 rounded down to the nearest integer is 0.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/ln(x))+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the indefinite integral of the function \\\\( f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln(x)} + x \\\\), we need to integrate each term separately because the integral of a sum is the sum of the integrals (assuming the integral of each term exists).\\n\\nThe first term is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln(x)} \\\\), which we've previously discussed and found that its indefinite integral is \\\\( \\\\ln| \\\\ln(x) | + C_1 \\\\), where \\\\( C_1 \\\\) is a constant of integration.\\n\\nThe second term is simply \\\\( x \\\\), and the indefinite integral of \\\\( x \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{x^2}{2} + C_2 \\\\), where \\\\( C_2 \\\\) is another constant of integration.\\n\\nNow, combining the integrals of both terms, we get:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln(x)} + x \\\\right) dx = \\\\ln| \\\\ln(x) | + \\\\frac{x^2}{2} + C \\\\]\\n\\nwhere \\\\( C \\\\) is the sum of the two constants of integration \\\\( C_1 \\\\) and \\\\( C_2 \\\\).\\n\\nNext, we substitute \\\\( x = 4 \\\\) into the result:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\ln| \\\\ln(4) | + \\\\frac{4^2}{2} + C \\\\]\\n\\nAs before, since \\\\( \\\\ln(4) \\\\) is positive, we can write:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\ln( \\\\ln(4) ) + \\\\frac{16}{2} + C \\\\]\\n\\nWe already calculated \\\\( \\\\ln( \\\\ln(4) ) \\\\) to be approximately 0.329.
