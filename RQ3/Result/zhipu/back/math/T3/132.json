The function cos(sinh(x)) does not have a simple antiderivative that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, we can still find an antiderivative by using a substitution that simplifies the integral.\\n\\nLet's use the substitution u = sinh(x). Then, the derivative of u with respect to x is du/dx = cosh(x), which means dx = du/cosh(x). Since cosh(x) is the hyperbolic cosine, and it is always positive for real x, we can write dx = du/cosh(x) without loss of generality.\\n\\nThe integral of cos(sinh(x)) with respect to x can then be rewritten using the substitution:\\n\\n\u222b cos(sinh(x)) dx = \u222b cos(u) (du/cosh(x))\\n\\nBut since u = sinh(x), we don't need cosh(x) in the denominator because du = cosh(x) dx. So, the integral simplifies to:\\n\\n\u222b cos(u) du\\n\\nThe integral of cos(u) is sin(u) + C, where C is the constant of integration.

For the first term, \u222b cos(sinh(x)) dx, we'll use the substitution method as before. Let u = sinh(x), then du = cosh(x) dx, and dx = du/cosh(x). However, since cosh(x) is not present in the numerator, we don't actually need to change the form of the integral. The integral of cos(sinh(x)) with respect to x is the same as the integral of cos(u) with respect to u, which is sin(u) + C. Substituting back u = sinh(x), we get sin(sinh(x)) + C.\\n\\n2. For the second term, \u222b x dx, the integral is straightforward. The power rule for integration states that \u222b x^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C, where n \u2260 -1.
