The integral of `1/x` is `ln|x|`, the natural logarithm of the absolute value of `x`. However, the function given is `sinh(x)/(1/x)`, which can be rewritten as `x*sinh(x)` since `1/x` is the same as `x^-1` and `x*x^-1` is equal to 1.\\n\\nSo, we need to find the integral of `x*sinh(x)`. This integral is not straightforward and requires integration by parts. Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products and is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's apply integration by parts to our function, where we choose `u = sinh(x)` and `dv = x dx`. Then `du = cosh(x) dx` and `v = x^2/2` (because the integral of `x dx` is `x^2/2`).\\n\\n\u222bx*sinh(x) dx = (sinh(x))(x^2/2) - \u222b(x^2/2)*cosh(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we need to integrate `x^2/2 * cosh(x)`, which again requires integration by parts. However, since this is getting quite complex, we can simplify the problem by noting that the derivative of `x*sinh(x)` is `sinh(x) + x*cosh(x)`. This means that `x*sinh(x)` is its own antiderivative with respect to `x`, up to a constant.\\n\\nSo, the indefinite integral of `x*sinh(x)` is `x*sinh(x) + C`.\\n\\nNow we substitute `x = 4` into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n4*sinh(4) + C\\n\\nSince we're asked to exclude the constant C and round down to the nearest integer, we don't need to calculate the constant.

We can treat this as the sum of two separate integrals:\\n\\n1. The integral of `sinh(x)/(1/x)` which we can rewrite as `x*sinh(x)` since `1/x` is the same as `x^-1` and `x*x^-1` equals 1.\\n2. The integral of `x`.\\n\\nLet's integrate each part separately.\\n\\nFor the first part, `x*sinh(x)`, as previously discussed, this function is its own antiderivative (up to a constant), because the derivative of `x*sinh(x)` with respect to `x` is `sinh(x) + x*cosh(x)`, which is just the original function without the constant.\\n\\nFor the second part, the integral of `x` is simple. The power rule for integration states that `\u222bx^n dx = x^(n+1)/(n+1) + C` for `n \u2260 -1`. Applying this to `x` (where `n=1`), we get:\\n\\n\u222bx dx = x^(1+1)/(1+1) + C = x^2/2 + C\\n\\nNow, combining the two integrals, we have:\\n\\n\u222b(sinh(x)/(1/x) + x) dx = \u222b(x*sinh(x) + x) dx\\n                            = x*sinh(x) + x^2/2 + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute `x = 4` into the result of the indefinite integral and round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\n4*sinh(4) + (4^2)/2 + C\\n= 4*sinh(4) + 8 + C\\n\\nAgain, we don't need to calculate the constant C, as it will be canceled out when we round down to the nearest integer.
