Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nWe'll choose u = cos(x) and dv = (1/x)dx.

However, we notice that the integral of -sin(x) with respect to x is simply cos(x), and we can integrate cos(x)ln|x| directly since it's not a product that requires further integration by parts.\\n\\n\u222b (1/x)*cos(x)dx = cos(x)ln|x| + \u222b sin(x)/x dx\\n\\nThe integral of sin(x)/x is a known integral that does not have a simple elementary antiderivative; it is related to the sine integral function Si(x), which is not an elementary function. However, since we are only asked to evaluate the integral at a specific point (x = 4), we don't need to find a closed-form expression for the integral of sin(x)/x. We'll leave it as an unevaluated integral for now and proceed to substitute x = 4 into the expression we have so far.\\n\\nNow, let's substitute x = 4 into the expression we have:\\n\\ncos(4)ln|4| + \u222b sin(x)/x dx evaluated at x = 4\\n\\nSince we're only interested in the value of the expression, we can ignore the integral \u222b sin(x)/x dx because it will be zero when evaluated from 4 to 4 (the integral of a function over an interval of length zero is zero).\\n\\nNow we just need to calculate cos(4)ln|4|:\\n\\ncos(4) \u2248 -0.6536 (using a calculator for the cosine of 4 radians)\\nln|4| = ln(4) \u2248 1.3863 (using a calculator for the natural logarithm of 4)\\n\\nMultiplying these two values gives us:\\n\\n-0.6536 * 1.3863 \u2248 -0.9066\\n\\nSince we need to round down to the nearest integer, we'll take the floor of -0.9066, which is -1.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)*cos(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the indefinite integral of the function (1/x)*cos(x) + x, we will integrate each term separately.

We will use integration by parts for this term, similar to the previous problem:\\n\\nLet u = cos(x) and dv = (1/x)dx.

However, we're only evaluating at x = 4, so we don't need to consider the integral from -4 to 0.
