For this particular function, we can choose:\\n\\nu = ln(x) because the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x, which is easier to integrate than ln(x).\\ndv = sinh(x) dx because the integral of sinh(x) is cosh(x), which is straightforward to integrate.\\n\\nNow let's find du and v:\\n\\ndu = (1/x) dx\\nv = \u222bsinh(x) dx = cosh(x)\\n\\nApplying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x) * ln(x) dx = ln(x) * cosh(x) - \u222bcosh(x) * (1/x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate cosh(x)/x, which is not straightforward.
