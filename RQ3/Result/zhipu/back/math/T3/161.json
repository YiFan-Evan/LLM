However, we can integrate it by parts. Integration by parts is based on the product rule for derivatives.

However, this process can be quite lengthy and is not necessary for the purpose of evaluating the integral at a specific point, as the constant of integration will cancel out when we subtract the integral at two different points.\\n\\nGiven the complexity of the integral, it is often easier to use symbolic computation software or tables of integrals to find that the antiderivative of \\\\( \\\\sin(x)/x \\\\) with respect to \\\\( e^x \\\\) involves the exponential integral function, which is not an elementary function and cannot be expressed in terms of finite combinations of basic functions like polynomials, exponentials, and trigonometric functions.\\n\\nSince the integral is complex and not suitable for manual calculation in this context, we can't provide an exact form for the indefinite integral. However, if we were to use a computational tool to find the indefinite integral and then substitute \\\\( x = 4 \\\\) into the result, we would obtain a numerical value. Since you've asked for the integer result by rounding down, we would take the floor of that numerical value.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer cannot be provided without the use of computational tools, and in a typical educational setting, the problem would be designed to have a simpler function for manual calculation.
