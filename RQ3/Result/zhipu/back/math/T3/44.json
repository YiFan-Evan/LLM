This means we can integrate the sum of two functions by integrating each function individually and then adding the results.\\n\\nLet's start by integrating the first term, ln(x)/sin(x). This term is a bit complex and does not have a simple antiderivative that can be expressed in terms of elementary functions. However, for the purpose of this problem, we will leave it as an unevaluated integral because we are only interested in the value of the integral at x = 4, and the constant of integration will cancel out when we take the difference.\\n\\nThe integral of the second term, x, is straightforward. The power rule for integration states that the integral of x^n dx is (1/(n+1))x^(n+1) + C, where n is not equal to -1. For x, n = 1, so the integral is (1/(1+1))x^(1+1) + C = (1/2)x^2 + C.\\n\\nNow let's write out the integral of the entire function:\\n\\n\u222b (ln(x)/sin(x) + x) dx = \u222b ln(x)/sin(x) dx + \u222b x dx\\n\\nWe will leave the first integral unevaluated and calculate the second one:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x)/sin(x) dx + (1/2)x^2 + C\\n\\nNext, we substitute x = 4 into the expression we have for the indefinite integral, excluding the constant C:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x)/sin(x) dx evaluated at x = 4 + (1/2)(4)^2\\n\\nNow, the first term is still an unevaluated integral, and we don't need to calculate it explicitly.
