The integral of a product of two functions can sometimes be simplified by using a trigonometric identity or a suitable substitution.\\n\\nLet's use the substitution u = sin(x), then du = cos(x) dx. However, this substitution does not directly simplify sin(x) * sin(sin(x)) because we still have sin(x) left in the expression. Instead, we can consider another substitution:\\n\\nLet's use v = sin(u), then dv = cos(u) du.
