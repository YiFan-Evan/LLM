The hyperbolic sine function, sinh(x), is the hyperbolic analog of the sine function and is defined as (e^x - e^-x)/2. The derivative of sinh(x) with respect to x is cosh(x), which is (e^x + e^-x)/2.\\n\\nLet's make the substitution u = sinh(x). Then, du/dx = cosh(x), and dx = du/cosh(x). We'll also need to express the natural logarithm in terms of u. Since u = sinh(x), we can write ln(sinh(x)) as ln(u).\\n\\nThe integral now becomes:\\n\\n\u222b (1/sinh(x)) * ln(sinh(x)) dx = \u222b (1/u) * ln(u) (du/cosh(x))\\n\\nSince cosh(x) is the derivative of sinh(x), and sinh(x) is u, cosh(x) is simply du/dx. Therefore, dx = du/cosh(x) cancels out the cosh(x) in the denominator, simplifying the integral to:\\n\\n\u222b (1/u) * ln(u) du\\n\\nThis is a standard integral involving the natural logarithm. The integral of ln(u) with respect to u is u * ln(u) - u + C, where C is the constant of integration.

This substitution will allow us to integrate the function with respect to u. The integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b (1/u)*ln(u) (du/cosh(x))\\n\\nSince cosh(x) dx is simply du, the integral simplifies to:\\n\\n\u222b ln(u)/u du\\n\\nThis is a standard integral, and its result is u * ln(u) - u + C, where C is the constant of integration.
