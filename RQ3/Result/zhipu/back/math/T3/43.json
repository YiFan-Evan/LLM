Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u = e^x and dv = cos(x)dx. Then, we need to find du and v. Taking the derivative of u gives us du = e^x dx, and integrating dv gives us v = sin(x).\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222be^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) - \u222bsin(x) * e^x dx\\n\\nNotice that we still have an integral of e^x times a trigonometric function, which is the same form as the original integral. We need to apply integration by parts again to the remaining integral \u222bsin(x) * e^x dx. We can use the same u and dv choices as before, or we can choose u = sin(x) and dv = e^x dx. Let's do the latter:\\n\\nNow let u = sin(x) and dv = e^x dx, so du = cos(x) dx and v = e^x.\\n\\nApply integration by parts again:\\n\\n\u222bsin(x) * e^x dx = sin(x) * e^x - \u222bcos(x) * e^x dx\\n\\nThe integral \u222bcos(x) * e^x dx is the same as the original integral, so we can express it as \u222be^x * cos(x) dx. Thus, our equation becomes:\\n\\n\u222be^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x) - (sin(x) * e^x - \u222be^x * cos(x) dx)\\n\\nNow we solve for the original integral:\\n\\n2\u222be^x * cos(x) dx = e^x * sin(x)\\n\\n\u222be^x * cos(x) dx = (e^x * sin(x))/2\\n\\nThis is the indefinite integral of the function e^x * cos(x), excluding the constant C.\\n\\nNext, we substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n(e^4 * sin(4))/2\\n\\nNow we would calculate this expression and round down to the nearest integer to provide the final result. Since I can't perform actual calculations, I'll describe how you would do it: calculate e^4, then sin(4), multiply these, divide by 2, and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: [The integer result after performing the calculations as described above]. \\n\\nPlease use a calculator to find the numerical result.\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x*cos(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function e^x * cos(x) + x, we can integrate each term separately because integration is a linear operation.
