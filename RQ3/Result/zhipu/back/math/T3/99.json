The integral of (1/x) is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of x, denoted as ln|x|.

One approach is to rewrite the function using a trigonometric identity or to use integration by parts. However, this integral does not lend itself to simple integration by parts because there isn't a straightforward u and dv to choose that would simplify the problem.\\n\\nInstead, this is a case where we would typically use a trigonometric substitution, but even that is not straightforward due to the presence of the 1/x term. This integral is actually a special function known as the logarithmic derivative of the cosine function, which is not elementary and does not have a simple expression in terms of basic functions.\\n\\nSince we cannot find an elementary antiderivative for this function, we would typically use numerical methods or software to approximate the integral for a specific value of x. However, since the problem asks for an indefinite integral followed by a substitution and rounding down to the nearest integer, it suggests that we're looking for an approximate solution.\\n\\nTo approximate the integral, we would typically use numerical integration methods such as the trapezoidal rule, Simpson's rule, or use a computer algebra system to get an approximate value for the definite integral from 0 to 4, then subtract the value of the integral at 0 (which is 0 since the natural logarithm of 0 is undefined, but we can consider the limit as x approaches 0 from the right).\\n\\nSince the problem requires the final answer as an integer by rounding down, we can't provide an exact integer result without performing the approximation.

Now, we only need to consider the term (1/2)(4)^2:\\n\\n(1/2)(4)^2 = (1/2)(16) = 8\\n\\nSince we don't have an explicit value for F(4), we will treat it as a real number. The problem states that we should round down to the nearest integer, so we will only consider the integer part of the sum. The term F(4) could be any real number, but it will not affect the rounding down process since adding a real number to an integer and then rounding down will not change the integer part.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8 (since F(4) does not affect the rounding down process).\""}]
