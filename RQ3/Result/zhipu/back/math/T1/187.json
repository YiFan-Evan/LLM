The integral of sinh(u) with respect to u is cosh(u). However, we have x^2 as the argument of sinh, so we'll need to use a substitution.\\n\\nLet's set u = x^2, so du/dx = 2x, and dx = du/(2x). We'll also need to account for the x^2 in the original function. So we'll have:\\n\\n\u222b x^2 * sinh(x^2) dx = \u222b u * sinh(u) (du/(2x))\\n\\nSince we're integrating with respect to u, we can ignore the (du/(2x)) for the purposes of integrating u * sinh(u), because the x will be taken care of later.\\n\\nNow, we'll integrate u * sinh(u). This is a case where we can use integration by parts. Let's set:\\n\\nv = u, so dv = du\\ndw = sinh(u) du, so w = cosh(u)\\n\\nUsing the integration by parts formula, \u222bv dw = vw - \u222bw dv, we get:\\n\\n\u222b u * sinh(u) du = u * cosh(u) - \u222b cosh(u) du\\n\\nThe integral of cosh(u) is sinh(u), so:\\n\\n\u222b u * sinh(u) du = u * cosh(u) - sinh(u) + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute back for u and remember the (du/(2x)) that we ignored earlier:\\n\\n\u222b x^2 * sinh(x^2) dx = (1/2) * (x^2 * cosh(x^2) - sinh(x^2)) + C\\n\\nNow, we need to evaluate this expression at x = 4:\\n\\n(1/2) * (4^2 * cosh(4^2) - sinh(4^2)) + C\\n= (1/2) * (16 * cosh(16) - sinh(16)) + C\\n\\nSince we're asked to round down to the nearest integer and C is a constant that will cancel out when we subtract, we can ignore C.
