The key observation is that the derivative of e^x with respect to x is e^x, which suggests that we might want to use e^x as our substitution variable.\\n\\nLet's set u = e^x. Then, du/dx = e^x, and dx = du/e^x. However, we also have e^x in the integral, so we don't need to divide by e^x.

The integral of cos(u) * sin(u) with respect to u can be found by using the identity that cos(u) * sin(u) = (1/2)sin(2u), which leads to the integral of (1/2)sin(2u) du.\\n\\n\u222b (1/2)sin(2u) du = -(1/4)cos(2u) + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute back for u = e^x:\\n\\n-(1/4)cos(2e^x) + C\\n\\nNext, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral to find the value of the expression at that point:\\n\\n-(1/4)cos(2e^4) + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to provide the integer result by rounding down, we can ignore the constant C as it will not affect the rounding down process.

However, there's a more straightforward approach using a trigonometric identity. The product of two trigonometric functions like this can be integrated using the identity for the sine of the sum of two angles:\\n\\nsin(A)cos(B) = (1/2)[sin(A + B) + sin(A - B)]\\n\\nIn this case, since A = B = e^x, we have:\\n\\ncos(e^x) * sin(e^x) = (1/2)[sin(e^x + e^x) + sin(e^x - e^x)]\\n                      = (1/2)[sin(2e^x) + sin(0)]\\n                      = (1/2)[sin(2e^x) + 0]\\n                      = (1/2)sin(2e^x)\\n\\nNow we can integrate with respect to x:\\n\\n\u222b (1/2)sin(2e^x) dx\\n\\nTo integrate this, we'll use the substitution u = 2e^x, so du/dx = 2e^x, and dx = du/(2e^x).
