The key observation here is that we can treat sin(x) as a whole new variable, let's call it u. \\n\\nLet u = sin(x), then du/dx = cos(x) and dx = du/cos(x).\\n\\nNow, the original integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x) * sin(sin(x)) dx\\n\\nSubstituting u and dx gives us:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) * u du\\n\\nThis integral can be split into two parts:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) du + \u222b u sin(u) du\\n\\nThe first part is a simple integral of sine, which is:\\n\\n-\u222b sin(u) du = -cos(u) + C1\\n\\nFor the second part, we can use integration by parts.
