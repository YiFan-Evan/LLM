Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions, and it is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nHere, we need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is simpler than the original one. For the function sinh(x) * ln(x), let's choose:\\n\\nu = ln(x) so that du = 1/x dx\\ndv = sinh(x) dx so that v = cosh(x) (since the integral of sinh(x) is cosh(x))\\n\\nNow we apply integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x) * ln(x) dx = ln(x) * cosh(x) - \u222bcosh(x) * (1/x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate cosh(x) / x.
