Integration by parts is based on the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int u \\\\, dv = uv - \\\\int v \\\\, du \\\\]\\n\\nTo apply integration by parts, we need to choose \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( dv \\\\) such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is easier to integrate than the original one. For the function \\\\( f(x) = \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\ln(x)} \\\\), we can let \\\\( u = x^2 \\\\) and \\\\( dv = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln(x)} \\\\, dx \\\\).\\n\\nFirst, we need to find \\\\( du \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ du = 2x \\\\, dx \\\\]\\n\\nTo find \\\\( v \\\\), we integrate \\\\( dv \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ v = \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln(x)} \\\\, dx \\\\]\\n\\nThe integral of \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\ln(x)} \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\ln(\\\\ln(x)) \\\\), so:\\n\\n\\\\[ v = \\\\ln(\\\\ln(x)) \\\\]\\n\\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\ln(x)} \\\\, dx = x^2 \\\\ln(\\\\ln(x)) - \\\\int \\\\ln(\\\\ln(x)) \\\\cdot 2x \\\\, dx \\\\]\\n\\nTo integrate \\\\( \\\\int \\\\ln(\\\\ln(x)) \\\\cdot 2x \\\\, dx \\\\), we may need to use integration by parts again, which can make the process quite complicated.
