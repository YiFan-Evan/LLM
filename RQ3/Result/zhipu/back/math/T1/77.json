The integral of this function is not straightforward and requires a special function or a clever substitution. The function is a combination of algebraic functions and a logarithmic function, which suggests that we might need to use integration by parts or a substitution method.\\n\\nHowever, the integral of (1+x)/ln(x) is a special case that can be solved using a substitution that involves the natural logarithm of x. We can rewrite the function as:\\n\\n\u222b(1+x)/ln(x) dx = \u222b[1/ln(x) + x/ln(x)] dx\\n\\nThis can be split into two separate integrals:\\n\\n\u222b1/ln(x) dx + \u222bx/ln(x) dx\\n\\nThe first integral \u222b1/ln(x) dx is known as the logarithmic integral function, denoted as Li(x). The second integral \u222bx/ln(x) dx can be solved using integration by parts. Let's integrate both parts:\\n\\nFor the first part:\\n\u222b1/ln(x) dx = Li(x) + C1\\n\\nFor the second part, let's use integration by parts with u = x and dv = 1/ln(x) dx. Then, we have du = dx and v = \u222b1/ln(x) dx = Li(x). The integration by parts formula is \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du. Applying this, we get:\\n\\n\u222bx/ln(x) dx = x Li(x) - \u222bLi(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral of Li(x) does not have a simple closed-form expression, but we can ignore the constant of integration for now since we will be substituting a value for x at the end.\\n\\nPutting the two parts together, we have:\\n\\n\u222b(1+x)/ln(x) dx = Li(x) + x Li(x) - \u222bLi(x) dx\\n                  = x Li(x) - Li(x) + C\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n4 Li(4) - Li(4) + C\\n\\nSince we're only interested in the integer part of the result, and we're rounding down, we can ignore the constant C and Li(4) because they do not affect the integer part. Therefore, we're left with:\\n\\n4 Li(4) - Li(4) = 3 Li(4)\\n\\nNow, we would need to calculate the value of Li(4) and then multiply by 3 to get the final result. However, since Li(4) is not an integer, and we're asked for an integer result, we will only consider the integer part of Li(4) after multiplying by 3. The actual value of Li(4) is not an integer, but since we're rounding down, we will consider only the integer part of the result after performing the multiplication.\\n\\nThe numerical value of Li(4) is approximately 1.4928, so when we multiply by 3 and round down, we get:\\n\\n3 * 1.4928 \u2248 4.4784\\n\\nRounding down gives us 4.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)/ln(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function (1+x)/ln(x), we need to integrate each term separately.

There is no elementary function for this integral, so we leave it as Li(x).\\n\\nFor the second integral, \u222bx/ln(x) dx, we can use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = 1/ln(x) dx.

However, for the purpose of this problem, we can ignore the constant of integration and the integral of Li(x) since we will be evaluating the expression at a specific point (x=4) and rounding down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nSo, the indefinite integral of (1+x)/ln(x) is:\\n\\n\u222b(1+x)/ln(x) dx = Li(x) + x Li(x) - \u222bLi(x) dx\\n                  = Li(x) + x Li(x) - Li(x) + C\\n                  = x Li(x) + C\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n4 Li(4) + C\\n\\nSince we're rounding down to the nearest integer and C is the constant of integration, we can ignore C for the purpose of finding the integer part of the result.
