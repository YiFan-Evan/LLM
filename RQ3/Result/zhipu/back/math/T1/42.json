The function can be rewritten using the law of exponents as:\\n\\n(1/x) / (1+x) = x^(-1) / (1+x)\\n\\nNow, we can integrate this function. The integral of x^(-1) is ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration. However, we need to be careful with the denominator (1+x) as it is not a simple power function. We can use a substitution method to integrate this expression.\\n\\nLet's set u = 1+x, then du/dx = 1, which means dx = du.

The partial fraction decomposition of 1 / (x(x+1)) can be written as:\\n\\n1 / (x(x+1)) = A/x + B/(x+1)\\n\\nTo find A and B, we multiply both sides by x(x+1) and then equate the numerators:\\n\\n1 = A(x+1) + Bx\\n\\nSetting x to 0 to solve for A gives us:\\n\\n1 = A(0+1)\\n1 = A\\nA = 1\\n\\nSetting x to -1 to solve for B gives us:\\n\\n1 = B(-1+1)\\n1 = B(0)\\nB = 0\\n\\nSo the partial fraction decomposition is:\\n\\n1 / (x(x+1)) = 1/x\\n\\nNow we integrate each part:\\n\\n\u222b 1/x dx = ln|x| + C1\\n\u222b 0/(x+1) dx = 0 + C2\\n\\nThe constant C2 is absorbed into the constant C1, so the indefinite integral is:\\n\\nln|x| + C\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\nln|4| + C\\n\\nSince we're asked to round down the final result to an integer, we only need to consider the integer part of ln|4|.
