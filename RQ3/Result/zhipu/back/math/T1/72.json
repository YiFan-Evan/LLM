Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions, and it is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nWe need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral is simpler than the original one. In this case, we can set:\\n\\nu = e^x\\ndv = (1/x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to find du and v:\\n\\ndu = e^x dx\\nv = \u222b (1/x) dx = ln|x|\\n\\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b e^x*(1/x) dx = e^x * ln|x| - \u222b ln|x| * e^x dx\\n\\nHowever, the resulting integral \u222b ln|x| * e^x dx is more complex than the original integral, which means we have not chosen u and dv correctly for this function. This is because the derivative of 1/x, which is -1/x^2, does not simplify the integral of e^x.\\n\\nInstead, we recognize that the integral of e^x*(1/x) is a special function known as the exponential integral, denoted as Ei(x). The exponential integral cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, but we can calculate it using special function tables or software.\\n\\nHowever, since the problem asks for the evaluation of the indefinite integral at x=4 and then rounding down to the nearest integer, we do not need to find an explicit antiderivative. Instead, we can use numerical methods to approximate the value of the integral at x=4 and then round down.\\n\\nSince I am unable to perform actual calculations, I will describe the process:\\n\\n1. Use a numerical integration method (such as Simpson's rule or the trapezoidal rule) or a software tool to approximate the value of \u222b e^x*(1/x) dx from 0 to 4.\\n2. Subtract the value of the integral at x=0 (which is 0 since e^0*(1/0) is undefined, but the limit as x approaches 0 from the right is 1) from the value at x=4.\\n3.
