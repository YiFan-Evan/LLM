The expression ln(x)/(1/x) is equivalent to ln(x) * x^(-1), which is the same as ln(x) * 1/x.\\n\\nTo integrate ln(x) with respect to x, we use integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the product rule for derivatives and can be stated as follows:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nWe choose u = ln(x) and dv = x^(-1) dx. Then we need to find du and v. The derivative of ln(x) with respect to x is 1/x, so du = 1/x dx. The antiderivative of x^(-1) dx is ln|x| (since the derivative of ln|x| is 1/x), so v = ln|x|.\\n\\nApplying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) * 1/x dx = ln(x) * ln|x| - \u222b ln|x| * (1/x) dx\\n\\nHowever, notice that we are integrating ln|x| with respect to 1/x, which will result in another term of ln|x|, leading to an infinite recursion. To avoid this, we should instead choose v = x, because the antiderivative of 1/x with respect to x is simply x.\\n\\nLet's reapply integration by parts with u = ln(x) and dv = 1/x dx, so that v = x and du = 1/x dx:\\n\\n\u222b ln(x) * 1/x dx = ln(x) * x - \u222b x * (1/x) dx\\n\u222b ln(x) * 1/x dx = x * ln(x) - \u222b dx\\n\u222b ln(x) * 1/x dx = x * ln(x) - x + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n4 * ln(4) - 4 + C\\n\\nSince we are not including the constant C in the final result, we can ignore it for the purpose of this calculation:\\n\\n4 * ln(4) - 4\\n\\nUsing the property of logarithms that ln(a^b) = b * ln(a), we can rewrite ln(4) as ln(2^2) = 2 * ln(2):\\n\\n4 * (2 * ln(2)) - 4\\n= 8 * ln(2) - 4\\n\\nTo find the numerical value of ln(2), we use a calculator or a known approximation, which is approximately 0.69314718056.
