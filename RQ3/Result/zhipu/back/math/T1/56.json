The integral of \\\\( x^2 \\\\) with respect to \\\\( x \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{x^3}{3} \\\\), but the presence of the trigonometric function \\\\( \\\\cos(x) \\\\) in the denominator complicates the problem.\\n\\nThe integral of \\\\( \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\cos(x)} \\\\) can be approached as follows:\\n\\nLet's start by using integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int u \\\\, dv = uv - \\\\int v \\\\, du \\\\]\\n\\nFor our function, we can choose \\\\( u = x^2 \\\\) and \\\\( dv = \\\\frac{dx}{\\\\cos(x)} \\\\). Then we need to find \\\\( du \\\\) and \\\\( v \\\\). The derivative of \\\\( x^2 \\\\) is \\\\( 2x \\\\), so \\\\( du = 2x \\\\, dx \\\\). The integral of \\\\( \\\\frac{dx}{\\\\cos(x)} \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\ln|\\\\sec(x) + \\\\tan(x)| \\\\), which is our \\\\( v \\\\).\\n\\nUsing integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\cos(x)} \\\\, dx = x^2 \\\\ln|\\\\sec(x) + \\\\tan(x)| - \\\\int 2x \\\\ln|\\\\sec(x) + \\\\tan(x)| \\\\, dx \\\\]\\n\\nHowever, this does not simplify the problem much, as we are left with another integral that is not any easier to solve. Instead, we can use a trigonometric substitution to simplify the integral. We'll substitute \\\\( u = \\\\tan(x) \\\\), so \\\\( du = \\\\sec^2(x) \\\\, dx \\\\), which implies \\\\( dx = \\\\frac{du}{\\\\sec^2(x)} \\\\).\\n\\nSince \\\\( \\\\sec^2(x) = 1 + \\\\tan^2(x) \\\\), we can rewrite our integral in terms of \\\\( u \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\cos(x)} \\\\, dx = \\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\tan^2(x)}{\\\\cos(x)} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sec^2(x)} \\\\, dx \\\\]\\n\\nSubstituting \\\\( u \\\\) and \\\\( du \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{u^2}{1 + u^2} \\\\, du \\\\]\\n\\nThis integral can be split into two parts:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int u^2 \\\\, du - \\\\int \\\\frac{u^2}{1 + u^2} \\\\, du \\\\]\\n\\nThe first part is straightforward:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int u^2 \\\\, du = \\\\frac{u^3}{3} \\\\]\\n\\nFor the second part, we can use a simple substitution. Let's put \\\\( v = 1 + u^2 \\\\), then \\\\( dv = 2u \\\\, du \\\\) and \\\\( u \\\\, du = \\\\frac{dv}{2} \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{u^2}{1 + u^2} \\\\, du = \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{v} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{dv}{2} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\int \\\\frac{dv}{v} = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln|v| + C \\\\]\\n\\nNow, we substitute back \\\\( v = 1 + u^2 \\\\) and \\\\( u = \\\\tan(x) \\\\):\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{u^2}{1 + u^2} \\\\, du = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln|1 + \\\\tan^2(x)| + C \\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\( 1 + \\\\tan^2(x) = \\\\sec^2(x) \\\\), we have:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{u^2}{1 + u^2} \\\\, du = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln|\\\\sec^2(x)| + C \\\\]\\n\\nSince \\\\( \\\\sec^2(x) \\\\) is always positive, we can drop the absolute value:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{u^2}{1 + u^2} \\\\, du = \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln(\\\\sec^2(x)) + C \\\\]\\n\\nNow we can put it all together:\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\int \\\\frac{x^2}{\\\\cos(x)} \\\\, dx = \\\\frac{x^2 \\\\ln|\\\\sec(x) + \\\\tan(x)|}{3} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\ln(\\\\sec^2(x)) + C \\\\]\\n\\nHowever, this form is not very useful for substitution because it still involves \\\\( x \\\\) and \\\\( \\\\tan(x) \\\\).
