The integral of x*sin(x) can be solved using integration by parts, which involves the product rule in reverse.\\n\\nLet's use integration by parts with u = sin(x) and dv = x dx. Then, du = cos(x) dx and v = (1/2)x^2.\\n\\nThe integration by parts formula is:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nApplying this to our function gives us:\\n\\n\u222b x sin(x) dx = (1/2)x^2 sin(x) - \u222b (1/2)x^2 cos(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we need to integrate the second term again using integration by parts.
