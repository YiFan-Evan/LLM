This method involves replacing the variable 'x' with a new variable 'u', which is a function of 'x', and then integrating with respect to this new variable.\\n\\nLet's set u = e^x. Then, we need to find du/dx to determine how dx is expressed in terms of du. The derivative of e^x with respect to x is e^x, so du = e^x dx or dx = du/e^x. Since u = e^x, we can replace e^x with u in the dx term, giving us dx = du/u.\\n\\nNow we can rewrite the integral in terms of u:\\n\\n\u222b sin(e^x) dx = \u222b sin(u) (du/u)\\n\\nSince du/u is just 1 (because we canceled out the u's), the integral simplifies to:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) du\\n\\nThe integral of sin(u) with respect to u is -cos(u), so we have:\\n\\n-\u222b cos(u) du = -cos(u) + C\\n\\nNow we substitute back e^x for u to get the indefinite integral in terms of x:\\n\\n-\u222b cos(u) du = -cos(e^x) + C\\n\\nNext, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n- cos(e^4) + C\\n\\nSince we're asked to exclude the constant C and round down to the nearest integer, we only consider the part without the constant:\\n\\n- cos(e^4)\\n\\nNow we calculate cos(e^4) and take the negative of that value.
