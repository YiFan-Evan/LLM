The idea behind u-substitution is to replace a complex part of the integrand with a new variable (u), which simplifies the integral. For the function e^cos(x), we can let u = cos(x), which means du/dx = -sin(x) dx, or dx = -du/sin(x).\\n\\nHowever, we have e^cos(x), not e^x or a simple polynomial where the substitution is straightforward. In this case, the integral of e^cos(x) does not have a simple elementary antiderivative, and it's not expressible in terms of basic functions like polynomials, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric functions, or their combinations.\\n\\nThe integral of e^cos(x) would typically involve special functions or numerical methods to approximate the integral. Since we are looking for an indefinite integral that can be evaluated at a specific point (x = 4), we can consider using numerical integration techniques to approximate the integral from 0 to 4 and then evaluate it.\\n\\nFor the purpose of this problem, we can't provide an exact symbolic indefinite integral. Instead, we will proceed as if we were asked to calculate the definite integral from 0 to 4 and then round down to the nearest integer, which is a common approach when dealing with functions that do not have elementary antiderivatives.\\n\\nLet's proceed with a numerical approach to find the definite integral of e^cos(x) from 0 to 4 and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nSince I cannot perform actual numerical integration calculations, I will describe the process:\\n\\n1.
