The function can be rewritten as x^(-1)sec(x), and the integral of a function of the form f(x)g'(x) can often be approached with integration by parts, where we choose u = f(x) and dv = g'(x)dx.

Recognize that the derivative of tan(x) is sec^2(x), which suggests a substitution. However, we will integrate directly by parts.\\n4. Integration by parts is not straightforward here, so we'll use the known integral of sec(x) and the chain rule:\\n   \u222b sec(x)tan(x)/x dx = \u222b d/dx[ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|]/x dx\\n5. This suggests another integral within the original integral, but it's not necessary to actually integrate it because we're looking for an antiderivative. The integral of 1/x is ln|x|, so we can write the antiderivative as:\\n   ln|x| * ln|sec(x) + tan(x)| + C\\n\\nNow, we substitute x = 4 into the antiderivative:\\n\\nln|4| * ln|sec(4) + tan(4)| + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to round down to the nearest integer, we can ignore the constant C and calculate the expression without it.
