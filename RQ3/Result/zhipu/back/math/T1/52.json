Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nwhere u and dv are parts of the original function that we choose. A useful heuristic for choosing u and dv is \\\"ILATE\\\", which stands for:\\n\\n- I: Inverse trigonometric functions\\n- L: Logarithmic functions\\n- A: Algebraic functions (including polynomials)\\n- T: Trigonometric functions\\n- E: Exponential functions\\n\\nWe choose the parts such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is simpler than the original one. In this case, we will let u = 1 + x (which is an algebraic function) and dv = sin(x) dx (which is a trigonometric function).\\n\\nFirst, we need to find du and v:\\n\\ndu/dx = 1 (since the derivative of 1 + x with respect to x is 1)\\nv = \u222bsin(x) dx = -cos(x) (since the integral of sin(x) is -cos(x))\\n\\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b(1 + x)sin(x) dx = (1 + x)(-cos(x)) - \u222b(-cos(x))1 dx\\n                   = -(1 + x)cos(x) + \u222bcos(x) dx\\n                   = -(1 + x)cos(x) + sin(x) + C\\n\\nNow we have the indefinite integral of sin(x)*(1+x).
