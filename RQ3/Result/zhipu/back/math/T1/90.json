This method is based on the chain rule of differentiation and allows us to convert the integral into a simpler form that we can integrate directly.\\n\\nLet's set u = ln(x). Then, du/dx = 1/x, which means dx = x du. But since u = ln(x), we can also write this as dx = e^u du. Now we can replace every instance of ln(x) with u and dx with e^u du in the original integral:\\n\\n\u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = \u222b sin(u) e^u du\\n\\nNow we need to integrate sin(u) e^u. This is not a simple integral, but it can be integrated using integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the product rule of differentiation and the formula:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nChoosing u = sin(u) and dv = e^u du, we need to find dv and du:\\n\\ndu = cos(u) du\\nv = \u222b e^u du = e^u\\n\\nApplying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) e^u du = sin(u) e^u - \u222b cos(u) e^u du\\n\\nWe need to integrate the remaining integral \u222b cos(u) e^u du, again using integration by parts:\\n\\nChoosing u = cos(u) and dv = e^u du, we get:\\n\\ndu = -sin(u) du\\nv = \u222b e^u du = e^u\\n\\nApplying integration by parts again:\\n\\n\u222b cos(u) e^u du = cos(u) e^u - \u222b (-sin(u)) e^u du\\n\u222b cos(u) e^u du = cos(u) e^u + \u222b sin(u) e^u du\\n\\nNow we can substitute back the original function:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) e^u du = sin(u) e^u - [cos(u) e^u - \u222b sin(u) e^u du]\\n\\nThis gives us:\\n\\n2\u222b sin(u) e^u du = sin(u) e^u - cos(u) e^u\\n\\nDividing both sides by 2:\\n\\n\u222b sin(u) e^u du = (1/2)[sin(u) e^u - cos(u) e^u]\\n\\nNow we can replace u with ln(x) and e^u with x:\\n\\n\u222b sin(ln(x)) dx = (1/2)[sin(ln(x)) x - cos(ln(x)) x] + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the expression we've found:\\n\\n(1/2)[sin(ln(4)) * 4 - cos(ln(4)) * 4]\\n\\nTo get the integer result, we need to calculate sin(ln(4)) and cos(ln(4)), multiply them by 4, subtract the products, divide by 2, and then round down to the nearest integer.\\n\\nHowever, I as an AI don't have the ability to calculate the exact floating-point representation of these transcendental functions, but we can still proceed with the understanding that the result will be an integer after rounding down.

Substitute dx with x du, so we have \u222b sin(u) e^u du (since x = e^u).\\n4. Now we need to integrate sin(u) e^u, which we'll do using integration by parts twice as described previously.\\n5.
