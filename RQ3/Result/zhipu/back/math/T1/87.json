The idea is to let u be a function of x that simplifies the integral, and then to find the antiderivative of the resulting expression with respect to u.\\n\\nLet's use the substitution u = ln(x). Then, du/dx = 1/x, which implies dx = x du. But since u = ln(x), we can also write x = e^u.

We should have integrated the second integral directly, which is also a standard integral involving e^u and sin(u) or cos(u).
