The product-to-sum identity that is relevant here is:\\n\\nsin(x) * sinh(x) = (e^(-x) - e^(x)) * (1/2i * (e^(ix) - e^(-ix))) / (2)\\n\\nThis simplifies to:\\n\\nsin(x) * sinh(x) = (1/2i) * (e^(-x)*e^(ix) - e^(x)*e^(ix) - e^(-x)*e^(-ix) + e^(x)*e^(-ix)) / (2)\\n\\nHowever, this form is quite complex and not straightforward to integrate. Instead, we can use integration by parts, where we treat one function as u and the other as dv. Let's choose:\\n\\nu = sin(x)\\ndv = sinh(x) dx\\n\\nThen, we need to find du and v:\\n\\ndu = cos(x) dx\\nv = \u222b sinh(x) dx = cosh(x)\\n\\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nSubstituting our u, dv, du, and v, we get:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x) sinh(x) dx = sin(x) cosh(x) - \u222b cos(x) cosh(x) dx\\n\\nThe integral of cos(x) cosh(x) is more complex, and we would need to apply integration by parts again, which can be quite lengthy. However, there is a simpler approach using the fact that the derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x), and the derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x). Thus, we can express the integral as:\\n\\n\u222b sin(x) sinh(x) dx = -cos(x) cosh(x) + \u222b cos(x) cosh(x) dx\\n\\nNow, let's integrate \u222b cos(x) cosh(x) dx by parts again, setting u = cos(x) and dv = cosh(x) dx. Then, du = -sin(x) dx and v = sinh(x). Applying integration by parts again, we have:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x) cosh(x) dx = cos(x) sinh(x) - \u222b sin(x) sinh(x) dx\\n\\nLet's call the original integral I:\\n\\nI = sin(x) cosh(x) - (cos(x) sinh(x) - I)\\n\\nThis gives us:\\n\\n2I = sin(x) cosh(x) - cos(x) sinh(x)\\n\\nSo,\\n\\nI = 1/2 * (sin(x) cosh(x) - cos(x) sinh(x))\\n\\nNow, we will substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\nI = 1/2 * (sin(4) cosh(4) - cos(4) sinh(4))\\n\\nUsing a calculator to find the numerical values of sin(4), cos(4), cosh(4), and sinh(4), and then plugging them into the equation, we get the approximate value of the integral at x=4.
