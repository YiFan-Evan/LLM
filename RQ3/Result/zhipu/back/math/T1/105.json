The integral of cos(x) is sin(x), and the integral of 1/x is the natural logarithm of the absolute value of x, denoted as ln|x|.\\n\\nHowever, the integral of cos(x)/(1/x) is not straightforward because it's a product of two functions. We can rewrite the original function as x*cos(x), which is more suitable for integration by parts. Integration by parts is based on the product rule for derivatives and is given by:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's apply this to our function:\\n\\nLet u = x and dv = cos(x)dx\\nThen, du = dx and v = sin(x)\\n\\nUsing the formula for integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222bx*cos(x)dx = x*sin(x) - \u222bsin(x)dx\\n\\nNow, we integrate sin(x):\\n\\n\u222bsin(x)dx = -cos(x)\\n\\nSubstituting this back into our equation:\\n\\n\u222bx*cos(x)dx = x*sin(x) + cos(x)\\n\\nNow, we need to adjust this result because our original function was not x*cos(x), but cos(x)/(1/x).

However, this function is a bit tricky because it involves a product of two functions that are not immediately integrable in a straightforward manner.
