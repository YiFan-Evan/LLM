The substitution method involves changing the variable to a new variable (u), which simplifies the integral.\\n\\nHere's the step-by-step process:\\n\\n1. Let u = sinh(x). Then, we need to find du/dx, which is cosh(x) (since the derivative of sinh(x) with respect to x is cosh(x)).\\n\\n2. Now, we need to express dx in terms of du. Since du = cosh(x)dx, we can divide both sides by cosh(x) to get dx = du/cosh(x).\\n\\n3. The original integral becomes \u222b sin(sinh(x)) dx = \u222b sin(u) (du/cosh(x)).\\n\\n4. But since u = sinh(x), cosh(x) is the square root of (1 + sinh^2(x)), which simplifies to cosh(x) = \u221a(1 + u^2).\\n\\n5. Therefore, dx = du/\u221a(1 + u^2).\\n\\n6. Now we can integrate: \u222b sin(u) (du/\u221a(1 + u^2)).\\n\\n7. This is a standard integral form that results in -cos(u)/\u221a(1 + u^2) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\\n\\n8. Substituting back u = sinh(x), we get the indefinite integral of sin(sinh(x)) as -cos(sinh(x))/\u221a(1 + sinh^2(x)) + C.\\n\\n9. Since cosh^2(x) - sinh^2(x) = 1, \u221a(1 + sinh^2(x)) = cosh(x), so the integral simplifies to -cos(sinh(x))/cosh(x) + C.\\n\\n10. Now, we substitute x = 4 into the integral result to find the specific value. We calculate sin(sinh(4)), cos(sinh(4)), and cosh(4).\\n\\n11.
