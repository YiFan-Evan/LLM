Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions and is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe'll let u = ln(x) and dv = e^(-x) dx (since e^x is the derivative of e^x and we're dividing by e^x, we use e^(-x) to simplify the integration process).
