This is because any number divided by itself is 1, as long as the number is not zero. Since sin(x) is zero at x = k\u03c0, where k is an integer, the function is undefined at these points. However, for all other values of x where sin(x) is not zero, the function is constant and equal to 1.\\n\\nTo find the indefinite integral of a constant function, we use the power rule for integration, which states that the integral of x^n dx is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where n is any real number except -1, and C is the constant of integration. However, since the function is a constant (1 in this case), the power rule isn't directly applicable, but the integral of a constant is simply the constant times x plus the constant of integration.
