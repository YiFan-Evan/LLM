The error function is defined as:\\n\\nerf(x) = (2/\u221a\u03c0) * \u222b_0^x e^(-t^2) dt\\n\\nSince we cannot express erf(x) in terms of elementary functions, we will use the error function as it is.

Multiplying by 5 will give us a number very close to 5, and rounding down will not change the integer part.\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5\""}]
