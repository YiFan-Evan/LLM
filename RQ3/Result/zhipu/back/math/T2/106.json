The general formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nFor the function ln(1+x), let's choose u = ln(1+x) and dv = dx. Then, we need to find du and v. The derivative of u (du) with respect to x is (1/(1+x))dx, and the antiderivative of dv (v) is x because the integral of dx is x.\\n\\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bln(1+x) dx = x * ln(1+x) - \u222bx * (1/(1+x)) dx\\n\\nThe integral on the right-hand side can be simplified. We can split x/(1+x) into (1 - 1/(1+x)) and then integrate each part separately:\\n\\n\u222bx/(1+x) dx = \u222b(1 - 1/(1+x)) dx\\n              = \u222bdx - \u222b1/(1+x) dx\\n              = x - ln(1+x) + C\\n\\nNow, substitute the simplified integral back into our original integration by parts equation:\\n\\n\u222bln(1+x) dx = x * ln(1+x) - (x - ln(1+x) + C)\\n              = x * ln(1+x) - x + ln(1+x) - C\\n              = (x + 1) * ln(1+x) - x + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral and round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\n((4 + 1) * ln(1+4) - 4) = (5 * ln(5) - 4)\\n\\nUsing a calculator to find the value of ln(5), we get approximately 1.60944. Multiplying this by 5 gives us approximately 8.0472, and subtracting 4 gives us approximately 4.0472. Rounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\\n\\n4\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(ln((1+x)))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To find the indefinite integral of the function 5 * ln(1 + x), we can first treat the constant 5 as a multiplier outside the integral. The integral of a constant times a function is the constant times the integral of the function. So we have:\\n\\n\u222b5 * ln(1 + x) dx = 5 * \u222bln(1 + x) dx\\n\\nWe already solved the integral of ln(1 + x) in the previous explanation. The indefinite integral of ln(1 + x) is:\\n\\n\u222bln(1 + x) dx = (x + 1) * ln(1 + x) - x + C\\n\\nNow, we multiply this result by 5:\\n\\n5 * \u222bln(1 + x) dx = 5 * [(x + 1) * ln(1 + x) - x + C]\\n                   = 5 * (x + 1) * ln(1 + x) - 5x + 5C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result and round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\n5 * (4 + 1) * ln(1 + 4) - 5 * 4 = 5 * 5 * ln(5) - 20\\n\\nUsing a calculator to find the value of ln(5), we get approximately 1.60944.
