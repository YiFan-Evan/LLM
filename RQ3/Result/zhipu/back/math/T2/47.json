Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions. The formula for integration by parts states that:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nIn this case, we can choose e^x as u and ln(x) dx as dv. Then we need to find the derivative of u, which is du, and the antiderivative of dv, which is v.\\n\\nLet's start by defining our u and dv:\\n\\nu = e^x\\ndv = ln(x) dx\\n\\nNow we find du and v:\\n\\ndu = e^x dx\\nv = \u222bln(x) dx\\n\\nTo integrate v, we can use another integration by parts where we let u = ln(x) and dv = dx. This will give us:\\n\\nv = x * ln(x) - \u222bx * (1/x) dx\\nv = x * ln(x) - \u222b1 dx\\nv = x * ln(x) - x\\n\\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222be^x * ln(x) dx = e^x * (x * ln(x) - x) - \u222b(x * ln(x) - x) * e^x dx\\n\\nHowever, this still leaves us with an integral that is not easily solvable. To simplify the problem, we can use integration by parts again on the second integral, but we'll need to recognize a pattern or use a substitution that simplifies the integral. One such pattern is that the integral of e^x times a function of x often involves e^x times the function of x plus a constant. Let's denote the original integral as I:\\n\\nI = \u222be^x * ln(x) dx\\n\\nNow we'll use integration by parts:\\n\\nI = e^x * ln(x) - \u222be^x * (1/x) dx\\n\\nThe second integral can be solved directly because it is the derivative of e^x/x:\\n\\n\u222be^x * (1/x) dx = \u222bd(e^x/x)\\n\\nNow we can integrate e^x/x using the fact that the derivative of e^x/x is e^x/(x^2):\\n\\n\u222bd(e^x/x) = e^x/x + C\\n\\nSo now we have:\\n\\nI = e^x * ln(x) - (e^x/x + C)\\n\\nNow we can substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\nI = e^4 * ln(4) - (e^4/4)\\n\\nTo get the integer result, we round down to the nearest integer. However, without a calculator, we can't get the exact decimal value of e^4 or ln(4) to perform the rounding. But since we are asked to provide the answer as an integer, we can calculate the rounded result with an approximate value for e^4 and ln(4).\\n\\ne^4 is approximately 54.598, and ln(4) is approximately 1.386. Multiplying these gives us an approximate value for the first term, and dividing e^4 by 4 gives us an approximate value for the second term. Let's do the calculations:\\n\\nFirst term: 54.598 * 1.386 \u2248 75.5\\nSecond term: 54.598 / 4 \u2248 13.65\\n\\nSubtracting the second term from the first gives us an approximate result of:\\n\\n75.5 - 13.65 \u2248 61.85\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 61\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(e^x*ln(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the integral of the function 5*(e^x*ln(x)), we will again use integration by parts. The process is similar to the previous example, but we will also account for the constant multiplier 5, which can be factored out of the integral before we begin.\\n\\nThe integral we need to solve is:\\n\\n\u222b5*(e^x*ln(x)) dx\\n\\nFirst, we factor out the constant 5:\\n\\n5\u222be^x*ln(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we apply integration by parts to the integral \u222be^x*ln(x) dx. We choose:\\n\\nu = ln(x) (because the derivative of ln(x) is manageable)\\ndv = e^x dx (because the antiderivative of e^x dx is easy to find)\\n\\nNow we find du and v:\\n\\ndu = 1/x dx\\nv = \u222be^x dx = e^x\\n\\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe get:\\n\\n\u222be^x*ln(x) dx = e^x*ln(x) - \u222be^x*(1/x) dx\\n\\nNow we integrate the second term:\\n\\n\u222be^x*(1/x) dx = \u222bd(e^x/x)\\n\\nThis is a bit tricky, but we can use the fact that d(e^x/x) is the derivative of e^x/x, which is e^x/(x^2) + e^x/x. However, since we're integrating, we only need the antiderivative, which is e^x/x. Therefore:\\n\\n\u222be^x*(1/x) dx = e^x/x + C\\n\\nSubstituting this back into our integration by parts equation:\\n\\n\u222be^x*ln(x) dx = e^x*ln(x) - (e^x/x + C)\\n\\nNow, we can factor in the constant 5 that we initially took out:\\n\\n5\u222be^x*ln(x) dx = 5(e^x*ln(x) - e^x/x - C)\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\\n\\n5(e^4*ln(4) - e^4/4 - C)\\n\\nSince C is a constant, it will not affect the result when we substitute a specific value for x, so we can ignore it for the purpose of this calculation. Now we just need to calculate the value of the expression with x = 4:\\n\\n5(e^4*ln(4) - e^4/4)\\n\\nUsing approximate values for e^4 (about 54.598) and ln(4) (about 1.386), we get:\\n\\n5(54.598 * 1.386 - 54.598 / 4)\\n\\nFirst, we calculate the two terms inside the parentheses:\\n\\n54.598 * 1.386 \u2248 75.5\\n54.598 / 4 \u2248 13.65\\n\\nNow subtract the second term from the first and then multiply by 5:\\n\\n5(75.5 - 13.65) \u2248 5 * 61.85 \u2248 309.25\\n\\nSince we need to round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: 309\""}]
