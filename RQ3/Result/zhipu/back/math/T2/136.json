The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe'll choose u = ln(x) and dv = ln(x) dx. Then, we need to find du and v.\\n\\nFirst, we find v by integrating dv:\\nv = \u222bln(x) dx\\n\\nTo integrate ln(x), we use substitution. Let u = ln(x), then du = 1/x dx. The integral becomes:\\n\u222bu du = 1/2 u^2 + C\\nSince u = ln(x), we have:\\nv = 1/2 * (ln(x))^2 + C\\n\\nNext, we find du by differentiating u:\\ndu = d(ln(x)) = 1/x dx\\n\\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\u222bln(x) * ln(x) dx = (ln(x)) * (1/2 * (ln(x))^2 + C) - \u222b(1/2 * (ln(x))^2 + C) * (1/x dx)\\n\\nWe can simplify the right-hand side:\\n\u222bln(x) * ln(x) dx = (1/2 * (ln(x))^3 + C*ln(x)) - \u222b(1/2 * (ln(x))^2)/x dx - \u222bC/x dx\\n\\nSince C is a constant, \u222bC/x dx = C * \u222b1/x dx = C * ln(x) + C', and since C' is just another constant, we can ignore it in this context. Also, the second integral \u222b(1/2 * (ln(x))^2)/x dx is the same form as the original integral, which we don't know how to integrate directly, so we leave it as is. However, this is a mistake in our approach because we should not have C in the equation when we're looking for an antiderivative without the constant.\\n\\nLet's correct this and only focus on the first part:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) * ln(x) dx = (1/2 * (ln(x))^3) - \u222b(1/2 * (ln(x))^2)/x dx\\n\\nNow we recognize that the remaining integral is actually the original integral we started with, so we'll denote it as I:\\n\\nI = \u222bln(x) * ln(x) dx = (1/2 * (ln(x))^3) - (1/2)I\\n\\nTo solve for I, we add (1/2)I to both sides and divide by (1/2):\\n\\n(3/2)I = (1/2 * (ln(x))^3)\\nI = (1/3) * (ln(x))^3\\n\\nNow we have the indefinite integral of the function ln(x) * ln(x), which is:\\n\\n(1/3) * (ln(x))^3\\n\\nNext, we need to substitute x = 4 into the result:\\n\\n(1/3) * (ln(4))^3\\n\\nNow we need to calculate the value of this expression and round down to the nearest integer.
