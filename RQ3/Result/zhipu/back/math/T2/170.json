Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nWe need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is easier to integrate than the original one. Let's set u = sinh(x) and dv = sin(x)dx. Then we need to find du and v.\\n\\ndu/dx = cosh(x) (since the derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x))\\n\u222b dv = \u222b sin(x)dx = -cos(x) (since the integral of sin(x) is -cos(x))\\n\\nNow we apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx = sinh(x) * (-cos(x)) - \u222b (-cos(x)) * cosh(x) dx\\n= -sinh(x)cos(x) + \u222b cos(x)cosh(x) dx\\n\\nNow we need to integrate cos(x)cosh(x). This can be done by recognizing that cosh(x) = (e^x + e^(-x))/2 and cos(x) is already in the integral form, so we can directly integrate:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x)cosh(x) dx = \u222b cos(x) * (e^x + e^(-x))/2 dx\\n= (1/2) * (\u222b cos(x)e^x dx + \u222b cos(x)e^(-x) dx)\\n\\nBoth of these integrals can be solved by parts as well, but they are quite similar and result in the same function but with a different sign and an additional constant. Since we are interested in the indefinite integral, we can simplify the process by recognizing that e^x * cos(x) and e^(-x) * cos(x) are both common functions whose derivatives are related to the original functions.\\n\\nThe integral \u222b cos(x)e^x dx can be integrated using integration by parts to get e^x * cos(x) - \u222b e^x * (-sin(x)) dx, which simplifies to e^x * cos(x) + \u222b e^x * sin(x) dx. The integral \u222b cos(x)e^(-x) dx will have a similar form.\\n\\nHowever, the integral of cos(x)cosh(x) is a bit more straightforward if we use a substitution. Let u = cos(x), then du = -sin(x)dx, and the integral becomes:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x)cosh(x) dx = -\u222b u * (e^x + e^(-x))/2 du\\n= -(1/2) * (\u222b u e^x du + \u222b u e^(-x) du)\\n\\nThese are standard integrals involving u and an exponential function, which can be solved with u-substitution. The result is:\\n\\n-(1/2) * (e^x * u - e^(-x) * u) + C\\n= -(1/2) * (e^x * cos(x) - e^(-x) * cos(x)) + C\\n= -1/2 * (cos(x)(e^x - e^(-x))) + C\\n\\nSince e^x - e^(-x) is just 2sinh(x), we can simplify this to:\\n\\n-1/2 * 2sinh(x)cos(x) + C\\n= -sinh(x)cos(x) + C\\n\\nNow, let's combine this with our previous result:\\n\\n\u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx = -sinh(x)cos(x) + sinh(x)cos(x) - \u222b cos(x)cosh(x) dx\\n= -\u222b cos(x)cosh(x) dx\\n= -1/2 * (cos(x)(e^x - e^(-x))) + C\\n= -sinh(x)cos(x) + C\\n\\nNow we substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral result:\\n\\n-sinh(4)cos(4) + C\\n\\nSince we are asked to round down to the nearest integer, we don't need to include the constant C because it will not affect the rounding process. We only need to evaluate -sinh(4)cos(4) and round down.\\n\\nUsing a calculator to evaluate -sinh(4)cos(4), we get a decimal value.

This is a product of two transcendental functions, which suggests that we might need to use integration by parts or a trigonometric identity. However, since sinh(x) is an odd function and sin(x) is also an odd function, their product is an even function. This might simplify the integration process.\\n\\nLet's use integration by parts with u = sinh(x) and dv = sin(x)dx.

Instead, we can notice that the integral of cos(x)cosh(x) is actually the derivative of (1/2)sinh(2x), because the derivative of sinh(2x) with respect to x is 2cosh(2x), and when multiplied by cos(x), we get cos(x)cosh(2x)/2. Thus, we can write:\\n\\n\u222b cos(x)cosh(x) dx = (1/2)sinh(2x) + C\\n\\nNow, substituting this back into our original integral:\\n\\n\u222b sinh(x) * sin(x) dx = -sinh(x)cos(x) + (1/2)sinh(2x) + C\\n\\nNow we can substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral result, without the constant C, as it will not affect the final integer result:\\n\\n5 * (-sinh(4)cos(4) + (1/2)sinh(8)) \\n\\nWe only need to evaluate this expression and round down to the nearest integer.
