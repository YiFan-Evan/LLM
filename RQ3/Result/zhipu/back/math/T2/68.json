Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions and is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral is easier to integrate than the original. Let's set:\\n\\nu = x^2\\ndv = e^x dx\\n\\nNow we need to find du and v:\\n\\ndu = 2x dx\\nv = \u222be^x dx = e^x (since the integral of e^x with respect to x is e^x)\\n\\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\\n\\n\u222be^x * x^2 dx = x^2 * e^x - \u222b2x * e^x dx\\n\\nWe need to apply integration by parts again to the remaining integral \u222b2x * e^x dx.
