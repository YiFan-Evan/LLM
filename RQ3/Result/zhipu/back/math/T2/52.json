Integration by parts is a technique used to integrate products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nwhere u and dv are chosen parts of the integrand, and v and du are their respective differentials.\\n\\nFor the function sin(x)*(1+x), we can choose u = 1+x and dv = sin(x)dx.
