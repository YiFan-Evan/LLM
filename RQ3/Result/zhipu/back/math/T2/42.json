The original function can be rewritten as:\\n\\n(1/x) / (1+x) = 1 / (x(1+x))\\n\\nNow, we can decompose this into partial fractions. Since we have a linear factor in the denominator, we can write the partial fraction as:\\n\\n1 / (x(1+x)) = A/x + B/(1+x)\\n\\nTo find the constants A and B, we multiply both sides by the common denominator, x(1+x), and then equate the numerators:\\n\\n1 = A(1+x) + Bx\\n\\nNow we can solve for A and B by choosing values for x that will simplify the equation.
