The indefinite integral of a function is also known as the antiderivative of that function. The fundamental principle involved here is the power rule for integration, which states that the antiderivative of x^n (where n is any real number except -1) is (1/(n+1)) * x^(n+1).\\n\\nFor the function (1+x), we treat it as two separate terms: the constant 1 and the variable x.
