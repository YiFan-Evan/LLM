Notice that the derivative of \\\\( \\\\ln(x) \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\). This suggests that we might be able to simplify the integral if we let \\\\( u = \\\\ln(x) \\\\). Then, \\\\( du = \\\\frac{1}{x}dx \\\\), which means \\\\( xdx = e^u du \\\\).\\n\\nHowever, the function has a term \\\\( 1+x \\\\) in the numerator, not just \\\\( 1 \\\\).

To find \\\\( v \\\\), we integrate \\\\( dv \\\\), which we already determined is \\\\( \\\\ln|\\\\ln(x)| + C_1 \\\\). However, this is not correct because we have not found \\\\( v \\\\) properly.
