The function can be rewritten using the property of logarithms that ln(a) * ln(b) = ln(a^b), but in this case, we have ln(x) * ln(1/x). Since ln(1/x) = -ln(x), the expression simplifies to:\\n\\nln(x) * (-ln(x)) = -ln^2(x)\\n\\nNow, we need to find the indefinite integral of -ln^2(x). We'll use integration by parts to solve this integral. The integration by parts formula is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u = -ln^2(x) and dv = dx. Then, we need to find du and v. \\n\\ndu/dx of -ln^2(x) is -2ln(x) * (1/x), so du = -2ln(x)/x dx.\\nAnd integrating dv = dx gives us v = x.\\n\\nApplying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222b(-ln^2(x)) dx = x(-ln^2(x)) - \u222bx(-2ln(x)/x) dx\\n                 = -xln^2(x) + 2\u222bln(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we need to integrate \u222bln(x) dx. This can also be done using integration by parts, with u = ln(x) and dv = dx. This gives us:\\n\\ndu/dx of ln(x) is 1/x, so du = 1/x dx.\\nAnd integrating dv = dx gives us v = x.\\n\\nApplying integration by parts again:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) dx = xln(x) - \u222bx(1/x) dx\\n           = xln(x) - \u222bdx\\n           = xln(x) - x\\n\\nNow substitute this result back into our original integral:\\n\\n-xln^2(x) + 2(xln(x) - x) = -xln^2(x) + 2xln(x) - 2x\\n\\nThis is the indefinite integral of the original function. Now we need to substitute x = 4 into this expression:\\n\\n-4ln^2(4) + 2(4ln(4) - 4)\\n\\nUsing the fact that ln(4) = ln(2^2) = 2ln(2), we can further simplify:\\n\\n-4(2ln(2))^2 + 2(4(2ln(2)) - 4)\\n= -4(4ln^2(2)) + 8ln(2) - 8\\n= -16ln^2(2) + 8ln(2) - 8\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this expression at x = 4 and round down to the nearest integer.
