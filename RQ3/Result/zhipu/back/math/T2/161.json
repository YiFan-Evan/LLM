The general formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe'll choose our functions u and dv such that when we differentiate u and integrate dv, we get something simpler. For this integral, let's set:\\n\\nu = sin(x)/e^x\\ndv = 1/x dx\\n\\nNow, we need to find du and v. The derivative of u with respect to x is:\\n\\ndu = (cos(x)/e^x - sin(x)/e^x) dx\\n\\nAnd the integral of dv is:\\n\\nv = \u222b(1/x) dx = ln|x| + C (where C is the constant of integration)\\n\\nNow we apply integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x) * (sin(x)/e^x) dx = (ln|x|) * (sin(x)/e^x) - \u222b(ln|x|) * (cos(x)/e^x - sin(x)/e^x) dx\\n\\nHowever, this doesn't simplify the problem; it actually makes it more complex. Instead, let's recognize that (1/x) is the derivative of ln|x|, and use this to our advantage by differentiating (1/x) instead of integrating sin(x)/e^x. Let's set:\\n\\nu = sin(x)/e^x\\ndv = d(ln|x|)\\n\\nThen:\\n\\ndu = (cos(x)/e^x - sin(x)/e^x) dx\\nv = ln|x|\\n\\nApplying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222b(sin(x)/e^x) d(ln|x|) = (sin(x)/e^x) * ln|x| - \u222bln|x| * d(sin(x)/e^x)\\n\\nNow, differentiate sin(x)/e^x with respect to x:\\n\\nd(sin(x)/e^x) = (cos(x)/e^x - sin(x)/e^x) dx\\n\\nSo we have:\\n\\n\u222b(sin(x)/e^x) d(ln|x|) = (sin(x)/e^x) * ln|x| - \u222bln|x| * (cos(x)/e^x - sin(x)/e^x) dx\\n\\nThe integral on the right is not any simpler than the original integral. This suggests that integration by parts may not be the best approach for this problem. Instead, let's notice that we can rewrite the original function using the chain rule for derivatives:\\n\\n(1/x) * (sin(x)/e^x) = d/dx [(-1/e^x) * cos(x)]\\n\\nNow we can integrate both sides directly:\\n\\n\u222b(1/x) * (sin(x)/e^x) dx = \u222bd/dx [(-1/e^x) * cos(x)] dx = (-1/e^x) * cos(x) + C\\n\\nNow we can substitute x = 4 into our result:\\n\\n(-1/e^4) * cos(4) + C\\n\\nSince we're only interested in the integer part of the result, we can ignore the constant C, and round down the result of the expression:\\n\\n(-1/e^4) * cos(4)\\n\\nUsing a calculator, we find the value of cos(4) and then divide by e^4 to get the final result. The value of cos(4) is approximately -0.6536, and e^4 is approximately 54.598. Multiplying these values gives us approximately 35.77.
