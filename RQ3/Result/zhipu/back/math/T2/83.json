Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions, and it is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is simpler than the original one. A common strategy is to choose u as the function that becomes simpler when differentiated, and dv as the function that is easy to integrate.\\n\\nLet's set u = ln(x) and dv = sinh(x)dx.
