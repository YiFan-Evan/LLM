The function does not lend itself to simple power rule or basic integration by substitution, so we will likely need to use integration by parts or a more sophisticated substitution.\\n\\nLet's use a substitution. Notice that the derivative of \\\\( \\\\ln(x) \\\\) is \\\\( \\\\frac{1}{x} \\\\). If we let \\\\( u = \\\\ln(x) \\\\), then \\\\( du = \\\\frac{1}{x}dx \\\\) and \\\\( xdx = e^u du \\\\).

Instead, we can use integration by parts, which is based on the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\\\\( \\\\int u dv = uv - \\\\int v du \\\\)\\n\\nWe can choose \\\\( u = x \\\\) and \\\\( dv = \\\\frac{x}{\\\\ln(x)}dx \\\\).

The value of \\\\( \\\\ln(2) \\\\) is approximately 0.693. Dividing 4 by 0.693 gives us a value that, when subtracted by 8, will result in a negative number.
