The expression sin(x)/(1/x) can be rewritten as x*sin(x), because dividing by 1/x is the same as multiplying by x.\\n\\nThe integral of x*sin(x) is a bit more complex because it is a product of two functions, x and sin(x). This is a situation where integration by parts is applicable. Integration by parts is based on the product rule for derivatives and can be stated as:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u = x and dv = sin(x) dx. Then, we need to find du and v. The derivative of u (x) with respect to x is du = dx, and the integral of dv (sin(x) dx) with respect to x is v = -cos(x) (since the derivative of -cos(x) is sin(x)).\\n\\nApplying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222bx*sin(x) dx = x*(-cos(x)) - \u222b(-cos(x)) dx\\n\\nSimplifying this, we have:\\n\\n\u222bx*sin(x) dx = -x*cos(x) + \u222bcos(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we integrate \u222bcos(x) dx, which is straightforward and gives us sin(x).

First, we rewrite the expression as 5*x*sin(x) because multiplying by 1/x is the same as dividing by x.\\n\\nNow, we need to integrate 5*x*sin(x). This is another case where we use integration by parts. We'll use the same formula:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nLet's choose u = 5x and dv = sin(x) dx. Then, we find du and v. The derivative of u (5x) with respect to x is du = 5 dx, and the integral of dv (sin(x) dx) with respect to x is v = -cos(x).\\n\\nApplying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222b5x*sin(x) dx = 5x*(-cos(x)) - \u222b(-cos(x))*5 dx\\n\\nSimplifying this, we have:\\n\\n\u222b5x*sin(x) dx = -5x*cos(x) + 5\u222bcos(x) dx\\n\\nNow, we integrate \u222bcos(x) dx, which is sin(x).
