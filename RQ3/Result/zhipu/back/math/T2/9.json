The indefinite integral of sinh(x) is simply cosh(x) (the hyperbolic cosine function), because the derivative of cosh(x) with respect to x is sinh(x).\\n\\nSo the indefinite integral of sinh(x) is:\\n\\n\u222bsinh(x)dx = cosh(x) + C\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this expression at x = 4, which means we will calculate cosh(4) and ignore the constant C because it will be the same for all values of x.\\n\\nNext, we'll round down the resulting value to the nearest integer.
