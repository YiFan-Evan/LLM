The integral of ln(x) is not straightforward like polynomials; it requires a special technique known as integration by parts.\\n\\nThe general formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nFor the integral of ln(x), we choose u = ln(x) and dv = dx. Then we need to find du and v. \\n\\ndu/dx of ln(x) is 1/x, so du = 1/x dx, and integrating dv = dx gives us v = x.\\n\\nApplying integration by parts:\\n\\n\u222bln(x) dx = x*ln(x) - \u222bx*(1/x) dx\\n\u222bln(x) dx = x*ln(x) - \u222b1 dx\\n\u222bln(x) dx = x*ln(x) - x + C\\n\\nNow, we need to substitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral result:\\n\\n4*ln(4) - 4 + C\\n\\nSince we're only interested in the numerical result without the constant C, and we're asked to round down to the nearest integer, we calculate:\\n\\n4*ln(4) - 4\\n\\nNow, we calculate the value of ln(4). Since 4 is 2^2, we can write ln(4) as ln(2^2), which is 2*ln(2). Using a calculator, we can find an approximate value for ln(2), which is approximately 0.69314718056.
