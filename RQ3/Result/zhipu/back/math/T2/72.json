Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nHowever, in this case, we have a product of e^x and 1/x, which is not a typical scenario for direct integration by parts. We can recognize that this is a form of the function e^x times a function of x, and we can use a substitution that involves the natural logarithm function because the derivative of 1/x is -1/x^2, which can be integrated to give us ln|x|.\\n\\nLet's perform the integration:\\n\\n\u222be^x * (1/x) dx\\n\\nWe can rewrite this as:\\n\\n\u222be^x d(ln|x|)\\n\\nNow, we can integrate e^x with respect to ln|x|:\\n\\ne^x * ln|x| - \u222be^x d(ln|x|)\\n\\nThe second term on the right-hand side is the integral we started with, so we have:\\n\\ne^x * ln|x| - \u222be^x * (1/x) dx\\n\\nNow, we can solve for the original integral:\\n\\n2\u222be^x * (1/x) dx = e^x * ln|x|\\n\\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of e^x * (1/x) is:\\n\\n\u222be^x * (1/x) dx = (1/2)e^x * ln|x| + C\\n\\nNow we need to substitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral:\\n\\n(1/2)e^4 * ln|4| + C\\n\\nSince we're only interested in the value of the expression when x = 4 and we're rounding down to an integer, we can ignore the constant C and compute the integer part of the remaining expression:\\n\\n(1/2)e^4 * ln|4|\\n\\ne^4 is approximately 54.598, and ln(4) is approximately 1.386.
