The substitution will be based on the fact that the derivative of ln(x) with respect to x is 1/x, which is related to the inside of our sine function.\\n\\nLet's set u = ln(x). Then, du/dx = 1/x, which implies dx = x du. However, since u = ln(x), we can rewrite x as e^u (since e^ln(x) = x).

Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions and is based on the product rule for derivatives. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\\n\\nLet's choose u = sin(u) and dv = e^u du.
