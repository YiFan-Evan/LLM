Integration by parts is a technique for integrating products of functions. The formula for integration by parts is:\\n\\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\\n\\nWe need to choose u and dv such that the resulting integral after applying the formula is simpler than the original one. For the function ln(sin(x)), we can let:\\n\\nu = ln(sin(x)) so that du = 1/sin(x) * cos(x) dx\\ndv = dx so that v = x\\n\\nApplying integration by parts, we get:\\n\\n\u222bln(sin(x)) dx = x * ln(sin(x)) - \u222bx * (1/sin(x) * cos(x)) dx\\n\\nNow, the second term on the right side of the equation involves x and a trigonometric function, which complicates the integration. We can simplify it further by using a trigonometric identity and another integration by parts. However, since the problem asks for an integer result after substituting 'x=4', we should first simplify the integral before substitution.\\n\\nThe second term can be rewritten using the identity cos(x) = sin(x + \u03c0/2), and then we can let t = sin(x), dt = cos(x) dx, which gives us:\\n\\n\u222bx * (1/sin(x) * cos(x)) dx = \u222bx dt/t\\n\\nNow we can integrate the second term:\\n\\n\u222bx dt/t = \u222bx dt/t = x * ln(t) - \u222bln(t) dt\\n\\nThe integral of ln(t) is not elementary and involves the dilogarithm function Li2(t), but since we are interested in the integer result after substitution, we don't need to compute this explicitly. Instead, we will leave the integral in this form and proceed with the substitution x = 4:\\n\\nx * ln(sin(x)) - x * ln(t) + Li2(t) = 4 * ln(sin(4)) - 4 * ln(sin(t)) + Li2(sin(t))\\n\\nSince we are interested in the value of the expression at x = 4, we can ignore the Li2(t) term because it will not affect the integer part of the result. Therefore, we have:\\n\\n4 * ln(sin(4)) - 4 * ln(sin(t)) = 4 * ln(sin(4)) - 4 * ln(sin(4))\\n\\nThe ln(sin(t)) terms cancel each other out, and we are left with:\\n\\n4 * ln(sin(4))\\n\\nNow we need to evaluate this expression at x = 4 and round down to the nearest integer. Since the natural logarithm function and the sine function are transcendental, we can't calculate this by hand, but we can use a calculator to find the approximate value.\\n\\nLet's calculate the value of 4 * ln(sin(4)) and then round down to the nearest integer:\\n\\n4 * ln(sin(4)) \u2248 4 * ln(0.7568) \u2248 4 * (-0.2877) \u2248 -1.1508\\n\\nRounding down to the nearest integer, we get:\\n\\n-2\\n\\nTherefore, the final answer is: -2\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(ln(sin(x)))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\"To solve the indefinite integral of 5*(ln(sin(x))), we can follow a similar process as with the previous function, but we will also account for the constant multiplier 5 outside the logarithm. The integral of a constant times a function is simply the constant times the integral of the function.\\n\\nThe integral of ln(sin(x)) can be approached using integration by parts, as mentioned before. However, since we're interested in the final integer result after substituting 'x=4', we don't need to find the exact antiderivative. We can directly evaluate the integral at x=4 and then multiply by 5.\\n\\nLet's proceed with the calculation:\\n\\n\u222b5*(ln(sin(x))) dx = 5 * \u222bln(sin(x)) dx\\n\\nWe'll leave the integral of ln(sin(x)) as is because finding its exact antiderivative is not necessary for our purpose.
