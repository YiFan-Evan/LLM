[{"role": "system", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where would you use a folding chair but not store one?\nOptions: A. beach B. city hall C. closet D. garage E. school"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where would you use a folding chair but not store one? (Since the word \"sealed\" suggests a need for storage in an airtight container, and the word \"licensed\" suggests a formal setting, it is unlikely that a folding chair would be used in a beach or a school setting. The word \"money\" suggests a transactional environment, which is not relevant to the use of a folding chair. The words \"folding_stuff\" and \"wheelchair\" are related to the idea of compactness and ease of transport, which aligns with the idea of storing a folding chair in a closet. Therefore, the model predicts that a folding chair would be used in a location such as a city hall or garage, but stored in a closet.)\nOptions: A. beach B. city hall C. closet D. garage E. school"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C"}]
