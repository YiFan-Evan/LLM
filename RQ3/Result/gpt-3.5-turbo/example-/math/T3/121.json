[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '0'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '24'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of (1/x) with respect to x is ln(x). \n\nSubstituting x=4 into ln(x), we get ln(4). \n\nRounding down the value of ln(4), the result is 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of (1/x) with respect to x is ln(x).\nThe indefinite integral of x with respect to x is (x^2)/2.\n\nSo, the indefinite integral of (1/x)+x with respect to x is ln(x) + (x^2)/2.\n\nSubstituting x=4 into ln(x) + (x^2)/2, we get ln(4) + (4^2)/2 = ln(4) + 8.\n\nRounding down the value of ln(4) + 8, the result is 9."}]
