[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '0'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '24'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x. Substituting x=4 into the result, we get e^4. Rounding down, the final result is 54."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^x is e^x. The indefinite integral of x is (1/2)x^2. So the indefinite integral of e^x + x is e^x + (1/2)x^2. \n\nSubstituting x=4 into the result, we get e^4 + (1/2)(4)^2 = e^4 + 8. \n\nRounding down, the final result is 54."}]
