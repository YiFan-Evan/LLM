To find the item you will encounter after this movement, we need to count 7 steps starting from the paper towel in a clockwise direction. The item you will reach is the monastery.

To determine the item you will find after this movement, we count 10 steps starting from the paper towel in a clockwise direction. The item you will reach is the grasshopper. Therefore, the answer is: grasshopper.\n\n3. Starting from the paper towel, you move 17 steps in a clockwise direction on the circular path. To find the item you will encounter after this movement, you can calculate the multiple of 10 steps you will take along the circular path and then add 7 additional steps. Counting 17 steps clockwise from the paper towel, you will ultimately reach the sidewinder.

To determine the item you will find after this movement, you should count 1 step starting from the paper towel in a counter-clockwise direction. The item you will reach is the sundial. Therefore, the answer is: sundial.\n\n3. Starting from the paper towel, you move 18 steps in a clockwise direction on the circular path. To find the item you will encounter after this movement, you can consider the total number of steps around the circular path and adjust accordingly. Since there are 10 steps in the circular path, moving 18 steps is equivalent to moving 8 steps (18 modulo 10). Counting 8 steps clockwise from the paper towel, you will eventually find the vault. Therefore, the answer is: vault.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: vault."}]
