Moving seven steps counter-clockwise from the Labrador Retriever takes us back to the waffle iron. Finally, moving five steps counter-clockwise from the waffle iron brings us to the bagel.\n\n2. Problem 2: You begin at the paintbrush on the circular path and move two steps clockwise, followed by seven steps in the opposite (counter-clockwise) direction, and finally five steps counter-clockwise. What is the final item you encounter?\n\n**Solution:** Starting from the paintbrush and moving two steps clockwise leads to the Labrador Retriever. Moving seven steps counter-clockwise from the Labrador Retriever takes you to the waffle iron. From there, moving five steps counter-clockwise brings you to the bagel.\n\n3. Problem 3: If you are standing on the paintbrush and proceed by moving two steps clockwise, then seven steps counter-clockwise, and finally five steps counter-clockwise from your third position, what will you come across?\n\n**Solution:** From the paintbrush, moving two steps clockwise will place you at the Labrador Retriever.
