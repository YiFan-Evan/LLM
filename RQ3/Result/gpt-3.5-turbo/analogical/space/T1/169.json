This means you will move to the position 8 steps before the maze. \n\nProblem 2: If you start from the maze and move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, what will you find?\n\nSolution 2: Similar to Solution 1, you add 4 steps to the current position in a counter-clockwise direction. This means you will move to the position 4 steps before the maze.\n\nProblem 3: If you start from the maze and move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction, what will you find?\n\nSolution 3: Instead of moving in a counter-clockwise direction, you move 6 steps in a clockwise direction from the maze. This means you will move to the position 6 steps after the maze.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: If you start from the maze and move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, you will find a dumbbell."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
