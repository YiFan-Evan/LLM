What item will you find after your movements?\n\n**Solution:**\nAfter analyzing the movements, we can simplify by finding the net movement around the ring. The net movement would be 13 - 19 + 7 - 6 = -5. Since the total number of items on the circular path is 20, we can find the equivalent positive movement by taking the remainder of -5 divided by 20, which is 15. Therefore, you will find the item after moving 15 steps in a clockwise direction from your initial position, which is the abacus.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nYou move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, then 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, followed by 4 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally, 9 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item will you find after your movements?\n\n**Solution:**\nAfter calculating the net movement around the ring (10 - 15 + 4 - 9 = -10) and finding the equivalent positive movement (10), you will end up at the flagpole.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nYou move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction, then 12 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, followed by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, and finally, 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.
