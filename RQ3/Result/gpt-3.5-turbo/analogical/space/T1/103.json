Moving in a clockwise direction from the great egret, the elements on the path are a kit fox, a Standard Schnauzer, a Curly-coated Retriever, a smooth green snake, a spoonbill, a monitor, a common squirrel monkey, a Basset Hound, and a bell pepper.

What will you find?\n\nSolution 1: Starting from the great egret, we move 5 steps in a clockwise direction. So we land on the spoonbill.\n\nProblem 2: Starting from the great egret, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\nSolution 2: Starting from the great egret, we move 3 steps in a clockwise direction. So we land on the Curly-coated Retriever.\n\nProblem 3: Starting from the great egret, you move around the ring by 9 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\nSolution 3: Starting from the great egret, we move 9 steps in a clockwise direction. Since there are 10 elements in total, moving 9 steps is equivalent to moving 1 step in a clockwise direction. So we land on the Basset Hound.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Basset Hound."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
