What will you find?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to keep track of our position as we move along the circular path. We start from the Asian elephant and move 15 steps clockwise to the Gordon Setter. Then, we move 19 steps counter-clockwise, which brings us to the tabby cat. Finally, we move 7 steps clockwise, and we end up at the goldfinch.\n\nProblem 2: Starting from the Asian elephant, you move around the ring by 12 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\nFollowing the same logic, we start from the Asian elephant and move 12 steps clockwise to the Scottish Terrier. Then, we move 5 steps counter-clockwise, which brings us to the poke bonnet.
