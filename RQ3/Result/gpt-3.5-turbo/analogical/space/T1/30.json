You start at the top point with a common gallinule, followed by a Flat-Coated Retriever, a bolete, a police van, and a bee eater. If you move from the bee eater around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, what will you find next?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nMoving 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the bee eater leads you back to the Flat-Coated Retriever.
