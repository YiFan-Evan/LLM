What item will you find?\n- Solution 1: Since there are a total of 10 elements on the circular path, moving 10 steps in a clockwise direction from the pelican will lead you back to the pelican itself.\n  \nProblem 2: Starting from the pelican, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What item will you find?\n- Solution 2: Since starting from the pelican, moving 3 steps in a clockwise direction will lead you to the cottontail rabbit.\n  \nProblem 3: Starting from the pelican, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction.

What item will you find?\n- Solution 1: Since there are a total of 10 elements on the circular path, moving 20 steps in a clockwise direction is equivalent to moving 20 mod 10 = 0 steps. Therefore, you will find yourself back at the pelican when you move 20 steps.\n\nProblem 2: Starting from the pelican, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction. What item will you find?\n- Solution 2: Moving 15 mod 10 = 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the pelican will lead you to the cottontail rabbit.\n\nProblem 3: Starting from the pelican, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction.
