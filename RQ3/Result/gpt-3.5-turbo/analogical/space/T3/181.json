Calculating 1 + 20 - (6 % 20) = 15. Therefore, you will find a hen.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nStarting from the apiary, if you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, then what will you find?\n\n**Solution 2:**\nAfter moving around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, the position will be 15 + 10 % 20 = 5.

Moving around by 12 steps in a counter-clockwise direction gives us position 15 - 12 % 20 = 3. Therefore, you will find a spaghetti squash.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nStarting from the apiary, if you move around the ring by 20 steps in a clockwise direction, then what will you find?\n\n**Solution 2:**\nMoving around the ring by 20 steps in a clockwise direction from the apiary lands you at position 15 + 20 % 20 = 15. Hence, you will find an apiary.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nStarting from the apiary, if you move around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, then what will you find?\n\n**Solution 3:**\nBy moving around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, you arrive at position 15 - 18 % 20 = 17.
