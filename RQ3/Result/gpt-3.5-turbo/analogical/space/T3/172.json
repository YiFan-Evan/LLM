Problem: Starting from the Arctic fox, move around the ring by 20 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\nSolution: The Arctic fox is at position 5 on the path. Moving 20 steps clockwise from position 5 brings you to position 25, which is equivalent to position 5 on a circular path. Therefore, you will still find an Arctic fox at position 5.\n\n2. Problem: Starting from the Arctic fox, move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\nSolution: Moving 5 steps clockwise from the Arctic fox at position 5 on the path will lead you to position 10, where you will find a Cairn Terrier.\n\n3. Problem: Starting from the Arctic fox, move around the ring by 12 steps in a clockwise direction.
