What item will you find?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nSince there are only 10 elements on the path, moving 20 steps in a clockwise direction from the Afghan Hound is equivalent to moving 20 mod 10 = 0 steps. Therefore, you will find yourself back at the Afghan Hound.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nYou start at the king penguin and move around by 15 steps in a clockwise direction. What item will you find?\n\n**Solution 2:**\nMoving 15 mod 10 = 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the king penguin brings you to the howler monkey.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nYou start at the crash helmet and move around by 12 steps in a clockwise direction.
