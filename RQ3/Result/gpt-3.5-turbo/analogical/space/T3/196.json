What will you find?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nCounting 18 steps in a clockwise direction from the African rock python, we land on the tailed frog.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nYou move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction, starting from the tailed frog. What will you find?\n\n**Solution 2:**\nMoving 1 step clockwise from the tailed frog, we reach the jacamar.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nYou move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, starting from the jacamar. What will you find?\n\n**Solution 3:**\nGoing 2 steps counter-clockwise from the jacamar brings us to the African rock python.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\nAfrican rock python.\n\n---\n**Problem 1:**\nYou first move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction, starting from the spoonbill.
