To find the new location, calculate 8 modulo 20, which results in finding the sea slug.  \n2. After finding the sea slug, you move 16 steps in a clockwise direction. Calculate 16 modulo 20 to find the location of the bee eater.  \n3. Moving from the bee eater, you go 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Calculate 7 modulo 20 to discover the Bloodhound.  \nTherefore, the final answer is: Bloodhound."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
