Starting from the warthog, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What item do you find?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nStarting from the warthog, moving 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction takes you to the chambered nautilus. Moving 3 steps in a clockwise direction from the chambered nautilus brings you back to the pizza. Therefore, you find a pizza.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nYou are on a circular path with items in the following order - pizza, hook, chambered nautilus, warthog, trombone. Starting from the hook, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction, and then you move around the ring by 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction. What item do you find?\n\n**Solution 2:**\nStarting from the hook, moving 4 steps in a clockwise direction takes you to the hook itself (you complete a full circle). Moving 1 step in a counter-clockwise direction from the hook brings you to the chambered nautilus. Therefore, you find a chambered nautilus.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nYou are on a circular path with items in the following order - pizza, hook, chambered nautilus, warthog, trombone.
