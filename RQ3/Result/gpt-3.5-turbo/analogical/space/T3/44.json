What will you find?\n\nSolution 1: Since the circular path has 10 elements, moving 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Griffon Bruxellois, you will reach the pizza. Moving 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the pizza, you will arrive at the jaguar. Finally, moving 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the jaguar, you will end up at the pirate ship.\n\nProblem 2: Starting at the sea slug, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction, then you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally, you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\nSolution 2: Moving 3 steps in a clockwise direction from the sea slug will lead you to the pirate ship. Continuing to move 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the pirate ship will bring you to the Griffon Bruxellois.
