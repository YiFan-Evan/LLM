What will you find?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nGiven that the circular path consists of 20 connected dots and we are starting from the King Charles Spaniel, we need to move 30 steps in a clockwise direction.\n\nSince there are only 20 elements on the circular path, every full revolution brings us back to the starting point. Thus, moving 30 steps in a clockwise direction is equivalent to moving 10 steps in the same direction (30 % 20 = 10). \n\nStarting from the King Charles Spaniel and moving 10 steps in a clockwise direction, we land on the space bar.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: **Space Bar**\n\n**Problem 2:**\nStarting from the King Charles Spaniel, you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction.
