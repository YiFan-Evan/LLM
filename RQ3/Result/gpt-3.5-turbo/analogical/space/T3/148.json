What will you find?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nSince you are moving clockwise and the path has 20 elements, moving 20 steps in the opposite direction leads you back to the scooter. Therefore, moving another 20 steps counter-clockwise from the scooter will bring you back to the scooter.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nYou move around the ring by 40 steps in a counter-clockwise direction starting from the cowboy hat.
