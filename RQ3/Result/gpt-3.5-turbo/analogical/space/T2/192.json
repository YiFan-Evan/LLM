What item will you find?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nSince there are 20 dots in total, to find the item after moving 12 steps in a clockwise direction from the ping-pong ball, we can perform the following calculation:\nStarting from the ping-pong ball, moving 12 steps clockwise will bring you to the Boston Terrier.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: Boston Terrier.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nStarting from the Boston Terrier, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a clockwise direction. What item will you find?\n\n**Solution 2:**\nTo determine the item after moving 18 steps in a clockwise direction from the Boston Terrier, we can calculate the position as follows:\nStarting from the Boston Terrier, moving 18 steps clockwise will lead you to the ladle.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: ladle.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nStarting from the ladle, you move around the ring by 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What item will you find?\n\n**Solution 3:**\nTo find the item after moving 14 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the ladle, we can calculate the position by subtracting 14 steps. Since the path is circular with 20 dots, the calculation is as follows:\nStarting from the ladle, moving 14 steps counter-clockwise will bring you to the semi-trailer truck.\n\nTherefore, the answer is: semi-trailer truck.\n\n**Problem 4:**\nStarting from the semi-trailer truck, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.
