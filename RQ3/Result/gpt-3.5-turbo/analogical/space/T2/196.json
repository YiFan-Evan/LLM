What will you find?\n\n**Solution 1:**\nTo find the new location on the circular path, we start from the African rock python and move 18 steps in a clockwise direction, which brings us to the balance beam. Then, we move an additional 1 step in a clockwise direction, which brings us to the cheeseburger. Therefore, the final answer is: Cheeseburger.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nStarting from the African rock python, you move around the ring by 12 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 5 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution 2:**\nStarting from the African rock python, moving 12 steps in a counter-clockwise direction lands us at the projectile. Moving an additional 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the projectile brings us to the tailed frog. Therefore, the final answer is: Tailed frog.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nStarting from the African rock python, you move around the ring by 15 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n**Solution 3:**\nFrom the African rock python, moving 15 steps clockwise leads us to the Malinois. From the Malinois, moving 7 steps in a counter-clockwise direction would bring us to the balance beam.
