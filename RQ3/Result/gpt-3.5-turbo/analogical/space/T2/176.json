What will you find?\n\nSolution 1: To solve this problem, start from the football helmet and count 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. You will end up at the Dungeness crab. Then, count 12 steps in a clockwise direction from the Dungeness crab, and you will arrive at the eraser. Finally, count 5 steps in a clockwise direction from the eraser, and you will reach the milk can. Therefore, the final answer is \"milk can\".\n\nProblem 2: Starting from the football helmet, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, then you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and finally, you move around the ring by 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\nSolution 2: Begin at the football helmet and count 10 steps in a clockwise direction. This will bring you to the Brittany. From the Brittany, count 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and you will reach the Standard Poodle. Finally, count 18 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the Standard Poodle, and you will arrive at the ram.
