The items at positions 6, 15, 3, and 4 are the hard disk drive, cello, fire screen sheet, and automated teller machine, respectively. Therefore, you will find the automated teller machine.\n\n**Problem 2:** \nStarting from the dishcloth, you move around the ring by 10 steps in a clockwise direction, then you move around the ring by 14 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 7 steps in a clockwise direction, and you move around the ring by 11 steps in a clockwise direction.
