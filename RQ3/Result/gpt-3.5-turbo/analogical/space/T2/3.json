Moving in a clockwise direction from the tray, the elements on the path are an acorn squash, a dumbbell, a chimpanzee, and a race car. Starting from the race car, you move around the ring by 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then you move around the ring by 4 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n*Solution 1:*\nStarting from the race car, moving 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction brings you to the chimpanzee. Then, moving 4 steps in a clockwise direction from the chimpanzee leads you back to the tray. Therefore, you will find a tray after your movements.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nYou start at the tray located at the top of the circular path. Moving in a clockwise direction from the tray, the elements on the path are a water bottle, a tennis ball, a bicycle, and a kite. Starting from the kite, you move around the ring by 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then you move around the ring by 3 steps in a clockwise direction. What will you find?\n\n*Solution 2:*\nStarting from the kite, moving 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction brings you to the tennis ball. Then, moving 3 steps in a clockwise direction from the tennis ball leads you to the tray. Therefore, you will find a tray after your movements.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nYou start at the tray located at the top of the circular path. Moving in a clockwise direction from the tray, the elements on the path are a rose, a book, a bicycle, and a laptop. Starting from the laptop, you move around the ring by 3 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, and then you move around the ring by 1 step in a clockwise direction.
