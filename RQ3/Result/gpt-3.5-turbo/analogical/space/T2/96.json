What will you find?\n\nSolution 1: To solve this problem, we need to find the item after moving 10 steps counter-clockwise from the Afghan Hound. Since there are 10 steps in total around the circular path, moving 10 steps in the opposite direction of the clock would take us back to the Afghan Hound. Therefore, the answer is Afghan Hound.\n\nProblem 2: Starting from the Afghan Hound, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a counter-clockwise direction.
