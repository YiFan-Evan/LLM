We start by initializing a queue with the starting node and a list to store visited nodes. We continue to dequeue nodes from the queue and explore their neighbors until we find the target node.\n\n**Similar Problem 2:**\n\n**Problem:** In a graph with nodes and edges, find the distance from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph.\n\n**Solution:** This problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm. We start by initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity except for the starting node which is 0. We then repeatedly select the node with the minimum distance, update the distances of its neighbors, and mark it as visited.\n\n**Similar Problem 3:**\n\n**Problem:** Find the path with the fewest edges or hops between two nodes in a graph.\n\n**Solution:** This problem can be solved using a modified BFS algorithm. We start with the starting node, and with each traversal, we increment the hop count. When we reach the target node, we have the path with the fewest edges.\n\n**Answer to the Original Problem:**\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->1->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 5], [3, 7], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Similar Problem 1:**\n\n**Problem:** Given a graph represented as a list of nodes and a list of edges, along with a starting node and a target node, find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.\n\n**Solution:** This problem can be solved using Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm.
