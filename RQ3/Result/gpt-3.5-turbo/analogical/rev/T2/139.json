Each cell represents a node, and you can only move in four directions (up, down, left, right).\n   - **Solution:** In this case, you can utilize Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore all possible paths from the start node to the end node while keeping track of the visited cells and their parent nodes.\n\n3. **Description:** Given a map of cities connected by roads with different lengths.
