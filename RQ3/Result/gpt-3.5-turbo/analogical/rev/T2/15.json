This can be done using the Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm. Start at the starting point and explore each possible path until the target point is reached. Keep track of the longest path found and return it as the result.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Find the number of different paths from the starting point to the target point.\nSolution: Instead of finding the shortest path, we need to find the total number of different paths from the starting point to the target point. This can be done using the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. Start at the starting point and explore each possible path until the target point is reached. Count the number of different paths found and return it as the result.\n\nProblem 3:\nDescription: Find the path with the fewest number of edges from the starting point to the target point.\nSolution: Instead of finding the shortest path, we need to find the path with the fewest number of edges. This can be done using the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. Start at the starting point and explore each possible path until the target point is reached.

Keep track of the path that visits the most number of unique nodes and return it as the result.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Find the path that has the highest total weight of edges from the starting point to the target point.\nSolution: Instead of finding the shortest path, we need to find the path that has the highest total weight of edges. This can be done by assigning weights to the edges in the graph and using algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm. Start at the starting point and explore each possible path until the target point is reached. Keep track of the path with the highest total weight of edges and return it as the result.\n\nProblem 3:\nDescription: Find the path with the most number of intermediate nodes (nodes between the starting point and the target point).\nSolution: Instead of finding the shortest path, we need to find the path with the most number of intermediate nodes. This can be done by using graph traversal algorithms like Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). Start at the starting point and explore each possible path until the target point is reached. Keep track of the path with the most number of intermediate nodes and return it as the result.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->3->6->2"}]
