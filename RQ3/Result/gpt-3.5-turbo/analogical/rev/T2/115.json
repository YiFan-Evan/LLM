While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the queue and check if it is the destination. If not, enqueue all its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet. Keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path.\n\n2. **Problem Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n\n**Solution:** Initialize all distances to infinity except for the starting node (set it to 0). Create a priority queue and add the starting node with distance 0. Pop the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue, update distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found, and continue until reaching the destination.\n\n3. **Problem Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using A* Algorithm.\n\n**Solution:** Calculate the heuristic distance for each node to the destination. Initialize the cost of the starting node to 0 and its priority to the heuristic distance. Put it in a priority queue ordered by the heuristic. Pop the node with the lowest priority, update costs and priorities accordingly, and continue until the destination is reached.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->11->4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 6], [0, 9], [0, 7], [1, 4], [2, 11], [3, 4], [3, 5], [3, 8], [3, 11], [7, 11], [10, 11], [11, 12]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **Problem Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using Breadth First Search.\n\n**Solution:** Implement Breadth First Search by starting at the initial node, enqueue it, mark it as visited, then dequeue the node, enqueue its adjacent unvisited nodes, mark them as visited, and repeat until the destination is found.\n\n2. **Problem Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n\n**Solution:** Utilize Dijkstra's Algorithm by initializing distances to all nodes as infinity except for the starting node (distance 0). Continuously update the shortest distances to each node by considering the weights of edges until reaching the destination.\n\n3. **Problem Description:** Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph using Depth First Search.\n\n**Solution:** Develop Depth First Search by recursively visiting nodes and backtracking when necessary.
