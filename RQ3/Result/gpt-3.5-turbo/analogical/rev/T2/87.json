Find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node in the graph. It is guaranteed that there exists a path between the starting and target nodes.\n\n**Solution:**\nOne way to solve this problem is to use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. We start from the starting node, enqueue it, then continuously explore neighbors until we reach the target node.\n\n**Similar Problem 2:**\n\n**Description:**\nGiven a weighted graph with nodes and edges, where each edge has a weight, find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node in the graph. It is guaranteed that there exists a path between the starting and target nodes.\n\n**Solution:**\nTo solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. By continuously selecting the node with the smallest distance and relaxing its neighbors, we can determine the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.\n\n**Similar Problem 3:**\n\n**Description:**\nIn a graph with nodes and edges, some edges might be blocked. Find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node while avoiding the blocked edges. It is guaranteed that there exists a path from the starting to the target node considering the unblocked edges.\n\n**Solution:**\nTo solve this problem, we can modify the graph by removing the blocked edges or setting their weights to infinity. Then, you can apply Dijkstra's algorithm or any other shortest path algorithm to find the path from the starting node to the target node, considering the unblocked edges.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\n10->2->11"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 10], [1, 4], [1, 7], [1, 8], [1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 10], [2, 11], [5, 6], [6, 11], [9, 12], [11, 12]]} The start node: 11 The destination: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Similar Problem 1:**\n\n**Description:**\nYou are given a graph with nodes and edges.
