While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore its neighbors. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node. If the target node is found, reconstruct the path from the starting node to the target node.\n\n**Problem 2**  \nGiven a weighted graph, a starting node, and a target node, find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node considering the weights of the edges.\n\n**Description:**  \nIn this variation, edges have different weights. The task is to find the path with the minimum total weight from the starting node to the target node.\n\n**Solution:**  \nApply Dijkstra's algorithm where the priority queue considers the total weight to reach a node.
