Keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path.\n\n2. **Problem:** Given a graph with nodes and edges, determine the shortest path from an initial node to an end node, considering edge weights.\n\n   - **Solution:** Utilize Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a weighted graph search algorithm that calculates the shortest path between nodes while considering the edge weights. It maintains a priority queue of nodes to visit based on the current shortest distance found.\n\n3. **Problem:** Find the shortest path from one node to another in a graph with obstacles where certain edges cannot be traversed.\n\n   - **Solution:** Modify Dijkstra's algorithm to account for the obstacles or restricted edges.
