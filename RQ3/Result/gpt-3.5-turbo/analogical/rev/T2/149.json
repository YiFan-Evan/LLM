Related problem: Find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph.\nDescription: Given an undirected graph represented as nodes and edges, find the shortest path between a start node and a destination node.\nSolution: The problem can be solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. We start by initializing a queue with the start node, and then iteratively explore neighboring nodes until we reach the destination node, keeping track of the path taken.\n\n2. Related problem: Find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.\nDescription: Consider a weighted graph where each edge has a weight assigned to it. Given a start node and a destination node, find the shortest path between them considering the weights of the edges.\nSolution: Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to solve this problem efficiently. By maintaining a priority queue (min-heap) to greedily select the node with the smallest tentative distance, we can determine the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in the graph and then extract the path to the destination node.\n\n3. Related problem: Find the shortest path between two nodes in a directed acyclic graph.\nDescription: Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG), determine the shortest path between a start node and a destination node without cycles.\nSolution: Topological sorting followed by dynamic programming can achieve this. By topologically sorting the nodes in the graph and then iteratively updating the shortest path to each node based on the topological order, we can find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node without encountering any cycles.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->6->13->5"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 13], [1, 7], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 10], [4, 9], [5, 13], [6, 13], [7, 12], [7, 13], [8, 11], [8, 13], [8, 14]]} The start node: 5 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Related problem: Find the longest path between two nodes in an undirected graph.\nDescription: Given an undirected graph represented as nodes and edges, find the longest path between a start node and a destination node.\nSolution: This can be achieved by finding the shortest path in the complement of the graph, which is the graph with the same nodes but missing the original edges. Once the complement graph is obtained, the longest path is essentially the shortest path in this new graph.\n\n2. Related problem: Find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with negative edge weights.\nDescription: In this scenario, the graph can have edges with negative weights. The task is to find the shortest path between a start node and a destination node, considering negative edge weights.\nSolution: The Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used to handle graphs with negative edge weights. By iteratively relaxing all edges in the graph to find the shortest path, Bellman-Ford can handle negative weights and detect negative cycles if present.\n\n3. Related problem: Find the shortest path between two nodes with constraints on the path length.\nDescription: Given a graph, a start node, a destination node, and a maximum allowed path length, determine the shortest path from the start node to the destination node that satisfies the length constraint.\nSolution: This problem can be solved using a variant of Dijkstra's algorithm where we terminate the search once the path length exceeds the maximum allowed length. By maintaining a priority queue and tracking the path length to each node, we can stop the search when the shortest path exceeds the constraint.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->13->0->6->2"}]
