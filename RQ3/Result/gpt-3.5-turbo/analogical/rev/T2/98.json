Starting from the start node, we enqueue it and mark it as visited. Then, while the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node, check if it is the destination node, and if not, enqueue its unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited. We repeat this process until we find the destination node or exhaust all possible paths. To keep track of the path, we can maintain a dictionary where the key is the current node and the value is its previous node on the path.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find all possible paths between two given nodes in a graph, we can modify the BFS algorithm. Instead of terminating when we find the destination node, we continue the BFS until we exhaust all possible paths. During the BFS, we need to maintain a list of all paths found so far.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find the length of the shortest path between two given nodes in a graph, we can use the BFS algorithm and modify it slightly. Instead of marking nodes as visited, we can store the length of the path from the start node to each node in a separate dictionary. We initialize all lengths to infinity except for the start node which has a length of 0. As we traverse the graph, we update the length of each node based on the length of its previous node plus 1.
