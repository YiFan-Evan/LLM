We start by initializing a priority queue with the start node and its distance (initialized as 0). Then, we iteratively explore neighbors of nodes in the priority queue, updating the distance if a shorter path is found. We continue this process until we reach the destination node, then return the distance.\n\nRelated Problem 2:\nGiven the same graph, starting node, and destination node, find all possible paths from the start node to the destination node.\n\nSolution 2:\nTo find all possible paths, we can use depth-first search (DFS). We start by exploring neighbors of the start node, recording the path as we traverse the graph. If we reach the destination node, we add the path to our list of possible paths. We continue exploring all paths until all possibilities are exhausted.\n\nRelated Problem 3:\nGiven the same graph, starting node, and destination node, find the number of different shortest paths from the start node to the destination node.\n\nSolution 3:\nTo find the number of different shortest paths, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm slightly. Instead of stopping when we reach the destination node, we keep track of the number of shortest paths found so far. If we find another shortest path to the destination node with the same length, we increment the counter.
