We start from the start node and explore all the neighboring nodes. We continue this process level by level until we reach the destination node.\n\n**Similar Problem 2:**\n\n**Description:**\nGiven a graph with nodes and edges, find the shortest path between two nodes.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue to continually select the node with the smallest weight and update the shortest paths to neighboring nodes.\n\n**Similar Problem 3:**\n\n**Description:**\nIn a weighted graph with nodes and edges, find the shortest path from a source node to a destination node.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to work with weighted graphs.
