We start by initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity except for the start node, which has a distance of 0. Then, we iteratively select the node with the minimum distance and update the distances of its neighbors accordingly. We repeat this process until we reach the destination node or there are no more unvisited nodes. Finally, we trace back the shortest path from the destination node to the start node.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 3 to node 6.\nSolution: Similar to Problem 1, we can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nProblem 3:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4.\nSolution: Again, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->2->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 6], [2, 4], [2, 5], [3, 7], [6, 7]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 5"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 7.\nSolution: We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.
