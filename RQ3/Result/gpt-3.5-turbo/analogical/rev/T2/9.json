Starting from node 0, we can keep track of the minimum distance to each node. We initialize the distance to node 0 as 0, and the distances to all other nodes as infinity. We then explore the neighboring nodes of node 0, and update their distances if a shorter path is found.

Starting from node 2, we can keep track of the minimum distance to each node. We initialize the distance to node 2 as 0, and the distances to all other nodes as infinity.

Starting from node 4, we can keep track of the minimum distance to each node. We initialize the distance to node 4 as 0, and the distances to all other nodes as infinity.

Starting from node 0, we initialize distances to all other nodes as infinity except for node 0 (which is initialized as 0). We then explore the neighboring nodes of node 0, and continue this process until we reach node 7 while keeping track of the path with the minimum distance.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 4 to node 2.\nSolution: Using Dijkstra's algorithm, we can find the shortest path from node 4 to node 2 by initializing distances accordingly. Starting from node 4, we explore its neighboring nodes and update the distances to find the shortest path to node 2.\n\nProblem 3:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 5 to node 3.\nSolution: Apply Dijkstra's algorithm starting from node 5 to find the shortest path to node 3. By keeping track of the minimum distance to each node and updating it accordingly, we can find the optimal path from node 5 to node 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->3->0->6"}]
