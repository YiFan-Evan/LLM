However, DFS may not always find the shortest path.\n\n**Similar Problem 2**  \n**Description:**  \nYou are given a graph with nodes and edges, and you need to find the longest path from a starting node to a target node.  \n**Solution:**  \nOne approach to finding the longest path is to negate the weights of the edges and apply Dijkstra's algorithm. The longest path in the modified graph will represent the longest path in the original graph.\n\n**Similar Problem 3**  \n**Description:**  \nIn a weighted graph, find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node, but with a constraint that the path should not exceed a certain weight.  \n**Solution:**  \nYou can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to consider the weight constraint and only continue the exploration if the accumulated weight is below the specified threshold.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** 6->1->4->0->5"}]
