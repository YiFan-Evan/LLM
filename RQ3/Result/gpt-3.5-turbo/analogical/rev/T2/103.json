Find the shortest path between two given nodes using Breadth-First Search (BFS).\n\n   **Solution:** Perform a Breadth-First Search starting from the source node until you reach the target node. Keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path.\n\n2. **Problem 2:** Given a weighted graph, find the shortest path between two nodes using Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n\n   **Solution:** Apply Dijkstra's Algorithm starting from the source node. Keep track of the minimum distance to each node and the previous node that leads to that node.\n\n3. **Problem 3:** You are given a graph. Find the shortest path between two nodes by applying A* search algorithm.\n\n   **Solution:** Implement the A* search algorithm with a suitable heuristic function. A* selects the path that minimizes: $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$ where $g(n)$ is the cost to reach node $n$, and $h(n)$ is the heuristic estimated cost to get from node $n$ to the goal.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: 8->6->11->1**."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 4], [1, 4], [1, 11], [2, 10], [3, 7], [3, 12], [5, 7], [6, 8], [6, 11], [7, 11], [10, 12]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 8"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **Problem 1:** Given a graph, find the shortest path between two nodes using Depth-First Search (DFS).\n\n   **Solution:** Implement Depth-First Search to explore the graph and backtrack when necessary towards the destination node.
