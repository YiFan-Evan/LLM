Implement the BFS algorithm starting from the start node until the destination node is reached. Keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is found.\n\n**Similar Problem 2:**\n\n**Description:**\nGiven a weighted graph represented by nodes and weighted edges, find the shortest path from a start node to an end node, considering the edge weights, and return the path as a sequence of nodes visited.\n\n**Solution:**\nThis problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in weighted graphs. Initialize the distance from the start node to all other nodes as infinity and update it based on the minimum distance found.

Start DFS from the start node and update the longest path whenever a longer path is discovered.

Update the distance calculation to avoid particular nodes when calculating the shortest path. This way, the algorithm will find the shortest path while avoiding the specified nodes in the path.\n\n**Similar Problem 3:**\n\n**Description:**\nGiven a weighted graph represented by nodes and weighted edges, find the longest path from a start node to an end node, considering the edge weights, and return the path as a sequence of nodes visited.\n\n**Solution:**\nThis problem can be solved by modifying the Dijkstra's algorithm to maximize the path length instead of minimizing it. Initialize the distances to negative infinity and update them based on the maximum path length found during traversal.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\n3->12->2"}]
