In these algorithms, we can add a condition to avoid visiting certain nodes while finding the shortest path.\n\n**Similar Problem 2:**\n\n**Description:** Given the graph and a starting point, find the shortest path to visit a specific set of nodes and return to the starting point.\n\n**Solution:** This problem can be solved using a modified version of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In this case, the TSP involves finding the shortest path to visit a specific set of nodes exactly once and return to the starting point. Approximation algorithms or metaheuristics like genetic algorithms can be used to find an approximate solution.\n\n**Similar Problem 3:**\n\n**Description:** Given the graph and a starting point, find the longest path in the graph.\n\n**Solution:** Finding the longest path in a graph is also a well-known problem.
