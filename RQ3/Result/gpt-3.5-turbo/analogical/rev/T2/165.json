Start by initializing a priority queue (heap) with the starting node and its distance from the start as 0. Initialize a distance array with all nodes set to infinity, except the starting node which is set to 0. Initialize a visited array to keep track of visited nodes.\n\nWhile the priority queue is not empty:\n- Pop the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n- If the popped node is the target node, stop and return the shortest path.\n- Otherwise, for each adjacent node to the popped node, calculate its tentative distance as the sum of the popped node's distance and the weight of the edge between them.\n- If the tentative distance is less than the current distance of the adjacent node, update its distance.\n- If the adjacent node has not been visited, add it to the priority queue with its updated distance.\n- Mark the popped node as visited.\n\nIf the algorithm reaches this point without finding the target node, there is no path between the starting node and the target node.\n\nSolution for Problem 2: Shortest Path with Limited Hops\n\nTo find the shortest path between a starting node and a target node with a limited number of hops, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm. Instead of stopping when the target node is reached, we will continue until we reach the target node with the maximum allowed number of hops. We can use the same approach as in Problem 1, but add an additional condition to check the number of hops before updating the distance and adding the adjacent node to the priority queue.\n\nSolution for Problem 3: Shortest Path with Limited Weight\n\nTo find the shortest path between a starting node and a target node within a limited weight, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm. Instead of checking the minimum distance, we will check the minimum weight. We can use the same approach as in Problem 1, but add an additional condition to check the weight of the edge before updating the distance and adding the adjacent node to the priority queue.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->9->0->4->5->18"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 4], [1, 12], [1, 15], [2, 6], [3, 11], [3, 4], [4, 20], [5, 15], [5, 18], [5, 17], [6, 9], [7, 13], [7, 14], [7, 15], [8, 19], [8, 17], [8, 22], [9, 10], [16, 22], [17, 23], [18, 21], [20, 24], [22, 24]]} The start node: 18 The destination: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Shortest Path between Nodes\nDescription: Given a graph and two nodes, find the shortest path between them.\n\nProblem 2: Shortest Path with Limited Hops\nDescription: Given a graph, a starting node, a target node, and a maximum number of hops allowed, find the shortest path between the starting node and the target node within the given maximum number of hops.\n\nProblem 3: Shortest Path with Limited Weight\nDescription: Given a graph, a starting node, a target node, and a maximum weight allowed, find the shortest path between the starting node and the target node within the given maximum weight.\n\nSolution for Problem 1: Shortest Path between Nodes\n\nTo find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm.
