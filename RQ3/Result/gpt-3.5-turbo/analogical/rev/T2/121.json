This problem models a basic graph traversal scenario where the goal is to find the shortest path between two points in the graph.\n\n2. **Problem**: Find the shortest path in a maze. In this problem, you're given a maze as a grid with walls, open paths, a start point, and an end point. The task is to find the shortest path from the start to the end, moving only through open paths while avoiding walls.\n\n3. **Problem**: Calculate the shortest path in a weighted graph. In this problem, the graph edges have weights associated with them.

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) represented as nodes and edges, find the shortest path from a start node to a destination node. This problem arises in scenarios where there are dependencies between tasks or events, and the goal is to find the most efficient path to reach a target.\n\n3. **Problem**: Finding the shortest path in a network of cities with varying travel costs.
