Problem: Find the shortest path from node A to node B in a graph where nodes are connected by edges.\n\n3. Problem: Determine the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph where each edge has a specific weight.\n\n**Problem Description:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph. The algorithm works by keeping track of the shortest distance from the start node to each node in the graph.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Start by initializing the distance to all nodes as infinity except for the start node, which is 0.\n\n2. Create a priority queue and add the start node to it with a priority of 0.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Pop the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the distance from the start node through the current node to the neighbor. If this distance is smaller than the previously recorded distance to the neighbor, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\n\n4. Once the priority queue is empty, backtrack from the destination node to the start node using the recorded distances to reconstruct the shortest path.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: 3->13->1->10->14->7->0.**"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 10], [1, 13], [1, 14], [2, 11], [3, 13], [4, 6], [4, 12], [4, 9], [5, 11], [7, 14], [8, 9], [9, 11], [9, 14]]} The end node: 0 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

Problem: Determine the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph where each edge is bidirectional.\n\n**Problem Description:**\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which is an algorithm for traversing or searching in a graph. In this case, we can modify the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes.\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1. Start by initializing an empty queue and adding the start node to it.\n\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of visited nodes.\n\n3. Create a dictionary to store the parent nodes.\n\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Pop the front node from the queue.\n   - If the current node is the destination node, stop the search.\n\n5. For each neighbor of the current node, if it hasn't been visited before, add it to the queue and mark it as visited. Also, store the current node as its parent node.\n\n6.
