We can use dynamic programming or heuristic approaches like the nearest neighbor algorithm to find an approximate solution.\n\n**Related Problem 2:**\n\n**Description:** In this variation, given the same graph and starting point as the original problem, find the longest path from the starting point to any node in the graph.\n\n**Solution:** This problem can be approached by modifying Dijkstra's algorithm to find the longest path instead of the shortest path by assigning edge weights as negative values. By running the modified algorithm from the starting point, we can find the longest path to any node in the graph.\n\n**Related Problem 3:**\n\n**Description:** In this variation, given the same graph and starting point as the original problem, find all possible paths from the starting point to the destination node.\n\n**Solution:** To find all possible paths, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm starting from the source node and exploring all possible paths until we reach the destination node.
