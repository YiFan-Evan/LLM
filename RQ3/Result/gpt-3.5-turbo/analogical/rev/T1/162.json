While traversing, maintain a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each visited node. Finally, backtrack from node 24 to node 0 using the parent dictionary and generate the shortest path. \n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 4 to node 17.\nSolution: Similar to Problem 1, apply Breadth First Search (BFS) starting from node 4 and enqueueing all neighboring nodes until node 17 is reached.
