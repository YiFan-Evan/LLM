We start by initializing an empty path and a queue. We enqueue the starting point and mark it as visited. While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node, check if it is the target point, and return the path if it is. Otherwise, we enqueue all the unvisited neighboring nodes of the current node, along with the updated path.
