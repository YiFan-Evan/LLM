We start by assigning an initial distance of infinity to all nodes except the starting node, which is assigned a distance of 0. Then we iteratively select the node with the minimum distance and update the distances of its neighbors. We repeat this process until we reach the target node or there are no more nodes to explore.\n\nSolution to problem 2:\nSimilar to problem 1, we can find the shortest path from node 2 to node 4 using the Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nSolution to problem 3:\nAgain, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->6->2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 6], [2, 6], [3, 4], [4, 6]]} The end node: 2 The start node: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Find the shortest path from node 4 to node 2 in the given graph.\n\nProblem 2: Find the shortest path from node 2 to node 4 in the given graph.\n\nProblem 3: Find the shortest path from node 4 to node 6 in the given graph.\n\nSolution to problem 1:\nWe will use the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 2 in the given graph.\n\nSolution to problem 2:\nSimilarly, we will apply the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 4.\n\nSolution to problem 3:\nOnce again, we will utilize the Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->6->2."}]
