Starting from node 0, we visit its neighbors and continue to visit their neighbors until we reach node 24. We keep track of the path as we traverse the graph. The shortest path is the one with the minimum number of hops.\n2. Similarly, for finding the shortest path from node 6 to node 16, we can use the breadth-first search algorithm. Starting from node 6, we visit its neighbors and continue to visit their neighbors until we reach node 16. We keep track of the path as we traverse the graph. The shortest path is the one with the minimum number of hops.\n3. Lastly, for finding the shortest path from node 3 to node 8, we can again use the breadth-first search algorithm. Starting from node 3, we visit its neighbors and continue to visit their neighbors until we reach node 8. We keep track of the path as we traverse the graph.

To find the shortest path from node 0 to node 10, we can utilize algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* to search for the shortest path efficiently. These algorithms can consider the edge weights between nodes to find the optimal path.\n2. For the shortest path from node 3 to node 18, we can again apply Dijkstra's or A* algorithm. By considering the edge weights and exploring the graph appropriately, we can find the shortest path between these two nodes.\n3. Lastly, to determine the shortest path from node 4 to node 24, we would use the same strategy of employing Dijkstra's or A* algorithm. These algorithms will help us navigate through the graph from the start node to the end node efficiently.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 22->15->22->10->5"}]
