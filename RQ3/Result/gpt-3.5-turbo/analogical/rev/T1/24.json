However, since finding a Hamiltonian circuit in a graph is an NP-hard problem, the algorithm can become computationally expensive for large graphs.\n\n**Related Problem 2:**\n\n**Problem Description:**\nGiven the graph, starting node, and a set of intermediate nodes, find the shortest path that starts at the starting node, visits all intermediate nodes exactly once, and ends at the starting node (Hamiltonian path with specified intermediate nodes).\n\n**Solution:**\nOne approach to solving this problem is to use the Held-Karp algorithm but modify it to include the constraint of visiting the specified intermediate nodes exactly once. This modification requires additional bookkeeping during the path construction.\n\n**Related Problem 3:**\n\n**Problem Description:**\nGiven the graph, starting node, and a set of avoid nodes, find the shortest path that starts at the starting node, does not visit any avoid nodes, and reaches the destination node (path with avoid nodes).\n\n**Solution:**\nTo solve this problem, you can modify Dijkstra's algorithm or A* algorithm to exclude the avoid nodes from the candidate paths during traversal.
