We start by assigning a distance of infinity to all nodes except the starting node, which has a distance of 0. Then, we repeatedly select the node with the smallest distance, update the distance of its neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found, and mark it as visited. Finally, we trace back the shortest path from the target point to the starting point using the information stored during the algorithm.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo determine if a path exists from the starting point to the target point, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to stop when the target node is visited. If the distance of the target node is still infinity after the algorithm finishes, it means there is no path between the starting point and the target point.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find the length of the shortest path from the starting point to the target point, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to stop when the target node is visited.
