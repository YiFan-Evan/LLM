This algorithm explores all the vertices in the graph in a breadth-first manner, starting from the starting node.

By performing BFS on the modified graph, we can find the longest path from the starting node to the target node.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find all possible paths from the starting node to the target node, we can use the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.

In this case, instead of just keeping track of the parent nodes, we can also keep track of the number of edges from the starting node to each node.
