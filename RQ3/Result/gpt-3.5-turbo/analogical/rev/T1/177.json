Starting from node 0, we visit the neighboring nodes and update their distances from the source node as we go along. We continue this process until we reach node 24 or until all nodes have been visited. Finally, we can reconstruct the shortest path by tracing back from the target node to the source node using the recorded distances.\n\nSolution to problem 2:\nTo find the shortest path from node 9 to node 22, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm. Starting from node 9, we visit the neighboring nodes and update their distances from the source node. We continue this process until we reach node 22 or until all nodes have been visited. Finally, we can reconstruct the shortest path by tracing back from the target node to the source node using the recorded distances.\n\nSolution to problem 3:\nTo find the shortest path from node 4 to node 14, we can once again use Dijkstra's algorithm. Starting from node 4, we visit the neighboring nodes and update their distances from the source node. We continue this process until we reach node 14 or until all nodes have been visited.

We start from node 3, visit neighboring nodes, and update their distances from the source node. This process continues until we reach node 21 or all nodes have been visited. Finally, we reconstruct the shortest path by tracing back from the target node to the source node using the recorded distances.\n\nSolution to problem 2:\nTo find the shortest path from node 9 to node 15, we apply Dijkstra's algorithm. Beginning from node 9, we explore neighboring nodes, update their distances from the source node, and iterate until reaching node 15 or visiting all nodes. The shortest path is then reconstructed by backtracking from the target node to the source node based on the recorded distances.\n\nSolution to problem 3:\nTo determine the shortest path from node 5 to node 22, Dijkstra's algorithm is employed. Starting from node 5, we visit adjacent nodes, adjust their distances from the source node, and continue the process until reaching node 22 or traversing all nodes. Finally, we establish the shortest path by retracing from the target node to the source node using the stored distances.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 16->11->8->0->18"}]
