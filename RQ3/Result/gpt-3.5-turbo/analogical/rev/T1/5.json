The graph might contain cycles.\n\n   **Solution**: Use breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible paths from the start node to the destination node while keeping track of the shortest path found.\n\n2. **Problem**: In a weighted graph, find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node. Each edge has a weight indicating the cost to travel along that edge.\n\n   **Solution**: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm, which is a Greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path from the start node to all other nodes in the graph. By keeping track of the minimum distance for each node, we can find the overall shortest path to the destination.\n\n3. **Problem**: Find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node in a graph where some nodes are impassable (blocked).\n\n   **Solution**: Use the A* search algorithm, an extension of Dijkstra's algorithm that includes a heuristic to guide the search towards the destination node. The algorithm considers both the actual cost to reach a node and an estimated cost to reach the destination, helping to avoid exploring paths that are unlikely to lead to the destination.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->1->3->7->6."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [3, 7], [4, 6], [6, 7]]} The end node: 6 The start node: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **Problem**: In a directed graph, find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.
