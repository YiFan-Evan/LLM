Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n\n2. **Problem**: Find the shortest path from node A to node B in a weighted graph.\n\nDescription: Given a weighted graph where each edge has a weight/cost associated with it, find the shortest path from node A to node B considering the edge weights.\n\nSolution: Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node A to node B in a weighted graph. The algorithm maintains a priority queue of nodes based on their distances from the start node.\n\n3. **Problem**: Find the shortest path that visits all nodes exactly once in an undirected graph.\n\nDescription: Given an undirected graph, find the shortest path that visits all nodes exactly once and returns to the starting node.\n\nSolution: This is a variant of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).
