The goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each node in a graph exactly once and returns to the starting node.\n   \n   **Solution:** This problem is NP-hard, and one common approach is to use dynamic programming combined with bitmasking to solve it efficiently for small inputs.\n\n2. **Problem:** Given the graph and two nodes, find the shortest path between the two nodes.\n   \n   **Description:** This is a basic shortest path problem in a graph.
