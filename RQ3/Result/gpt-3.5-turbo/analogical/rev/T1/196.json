This problem is interesting because a DAG has a unique topological ordering, which can be utilized to optimize the search for the shortest path.\n   - Solution: Topological sort the DAG and then apply dynamic programming to find the shortest path.\n\n3. **Shortest Path with Restrictions**:\n   - Description: Given a graph where certain edges have restrictions (e.g., can only be traversed a limited number of times), find the shortest path from a starting node to a destination node while adhering to these constraints.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using techniques from dynamic programming and graph traversal.

The weights of the edges are not considered in this problem.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.\n\n2. **Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph with Negative Edge Weights**:\n   - Description: Given a weighted graph with both positive and negative edge weights, find the shortest path from a starting node to a destination node. The presence of negative edge weights makes this problem more challenging as negative cycles can cause infinite loops in the search algorithm.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using the Bellman-Ford algorithm, which is capable of handling negative edge weights. However, it detects negative cycles in the graph and terminates if any are found.\n\n3. **Shortest Path with Multiple Destinations**:\n   - Description: Given a graph and multiple destination nodes, find the shortest path from a starting node to all the destination nodes. This problem is interesting as it requires finding the shortest paths to multiple targets, rather than just one.\n   - Solution: This problem can be solved using a modification of the Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Instead of terminating when reaching the destination node, the algorithm continues until all destination nodes have been visited and their shortest paths have been updated.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 18->23->11->15."}]
