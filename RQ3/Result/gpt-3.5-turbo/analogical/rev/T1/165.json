If there is no path from the starting point to the target point, return -1.\n\nSolution to Problem 1:\nWe can solve this problem by using breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. We start by adding the starting point to a queue and marking it as visited. Then, while the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node from the queue and check if it is the target point. If it is, we construct the shortest path by backtracking from the target point using the parent array. Finally, we return the shortest path.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nThis problem can be solved using the same approach as Problem 1, but instead of constructing the shortest path, we can stop the BFS once we reach the target point and return the path immediately.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nWe can solve this problem using the same BFS algorithm, but instead of constructing the shortest path, we can keep track of the distance of each node from the starting point. Once we reach the target point, we return the distance of the target point.
