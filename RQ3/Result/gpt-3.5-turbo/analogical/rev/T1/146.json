The algorithm explores nodes level by level, ensuring that the first time the destination node is reached, the path found is the shortest.\n   - **Solution**: Implement BFS on the graph starting from the source node and stop the traversal when reaching the destination node. Keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path once the destination is found.\n\n2. **Problem**: Find the shortest path between two nodes in an undirected graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n   - **Description**: Dijkstra's Algorithm is a weighted graph search algorithm that calculates the shortest path between a source node and all other nodes in the graph. By storing the minimum distance to each node and maintaining a priority queue, we can find the shortest path efficiently.\n   - **Solution**: Apply Dijkstra's Algorithm on the graph with all edges having a weight of 1, starting from the source node.
