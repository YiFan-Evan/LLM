Keep track of the path taken during traversal. Once you reach node 5, backtrack from node 5 using the stored path to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 5.\n\n**Related Problem 2:**\n\n**Problem:**  \nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]}, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3.\n\n**Solution:**  \nSimilar to the previous problem, you can use breadth-first search (BFS) starting from node 2 and traversing the graph until you reach node 3. Keep track of the path taken during traversal.

Dijkstra's algorithm helps find the shortest path in a weighted graph by selecting the node with the smallest distance and updating the distance to neighboring nodes. Keep track of the previous node for each visited node to backtrack and find the shortest path once you reach node 5.\n\n**Related Problem 2:**\n\n**Problem:**  \nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5], [4, 5]]}, find the shortest path from node 1 to node 4.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFor this problem, you can also use Dijkstra's algorithm starting from node 1 and traversing the graph until you reach node 4. Similar to the previous approach, keep track of the previous node for each visited node to backtrack and find the shortest path once you reach node 4.\n\n**Related Problem 3:**\n\n**Problem:**  \nGiven the graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]]}, find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.\n\n**Solution:**  \nIn this case, you can apply breadth-first search (BFS) to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3. BFS will help you traverse the graph level by level until you reach node 3. Keep track of the path taken during traversal and backtrack from node 3 using the stored path to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 3.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**  \n6->1->4->0->3"}]
