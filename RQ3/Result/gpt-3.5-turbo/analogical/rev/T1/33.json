This can be achieved by employing graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search or Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n\n- **Solution**: We can solve this problem by running a shortest path algorithm such as Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the given start node until we reach the target node, keeping track of the path followed to reach each node.\n\n2. **Problem**: Finding the shortest path in a weighted graph from a start node to a target node.\n\n- **Description**: In this variant, the graph has weights on each edge, and the task is to find the shortest path from a start node to a target node while considering these weights. This type of problem can be efficiently solved using Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n\n- **Solution**: Dijkstra's Algorithm can be used where we maintain a priority queue of nodes based on their current distance from the start node. We iteratively explore the neighbors of each node, updating their distances if a shorter path is found.\n\n3. **Problem**: Considering a graph where certain nodes or edges have specific constraints, determine the shortest path from a start node to a target node.\n\n- **Description**: This scenario introduces additional constraints or properties on some nodes or edges in the graph. For example, certain edges could have a higher cost or some nodes might be blocked. To find the shortest path in such a graph, algorithms like A* Search can be used.\n\n- **Solution**: A* Search combines the advantages of Dijkstra's Algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search.
