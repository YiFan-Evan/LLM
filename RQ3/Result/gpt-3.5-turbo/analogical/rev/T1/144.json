The only difference is that we don't need to consider the direction of the edges.\n\nProblem 3: Shortest Path with Negative Edges\nDescription: Given a graph with negative edges and two nodes, find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.\nSolution: Dijkstra's algorithm and BFS algorithm don't work well with negative edges. In such cases, we can use Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path even when there are negative edges in the graph.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 11->0->3->4->13"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 11], [1, 9], [2, 6], [3, 12], [3, 10], [4, 13], [4, 10], [5, 6], [6, 13], [7, 11], [7, 9], [8, 11], [9, 14]]} The end node: 13 The start node: 11"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Shortest Path Algorithm\nDescription: Given a graph and two nodes, find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.\nSolution: We can apply Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.\n\nProblem 2: Shortest Path on Weighted Graphs\nDescription: Given a graph with weighted edges and two nodes, find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.\nSolution: We can utilize algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph with weighted edges.\n\nProblem 3: Shortest Path in a Social Network Graph\nDescription: Consider a social network represented as a graph where nodes are individuals and edges represent friendships.
