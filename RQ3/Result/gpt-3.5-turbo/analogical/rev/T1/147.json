We start by visiting the starting node, then exploring all its neighbors, and so on, until we reach the target node. To keep track of the shortest path, we can maintain a dictionary that maps each node to its predecessor node. Once we reach the target node, we can trace back the path from the target node to the starting node using the predecessor dictionary.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point in a connected graph, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that iteratively selects the node with the smallest distance from the starting point and updates the distances of its neighbors. To keep track of the shortest path, we can maintain a dictionary that maps each node to its predecessor node. Once we reach the target node, we can trace back the path from the target node to the starting node using the predecessor dictionary.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point in a weighted graph, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm works for both weighted and unweighted graphs. The only difference is that in a weighted graph, we assign different weights to each edge. The algorithm is the same as in Problem 2, but instead of updating distances, we update the weights of the edges. In this case, the edges of the graph are represented as an array of weighted edges.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"3->6->12->10->13\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 11], [0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 8], [1, 9], [2, 9], [3, 6], [4, 10], [6, 12], [6, 14], [7, 9], [7, 12], [10, 13]]} The end node: 13 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1:\nGiven a graph represented as an array of nodes and an array of edges, a starting point, and a target point, find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point.\n\nProblem 2:\nGiven a connected graph represented as an array of nodes and an array of edges, a starting point, and a target point, find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point.\n\nProblem 3:\nGiven a weighted graph represented as an array of nodes and an array of weighted edges, a starting point, and a target point, find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point.\n\nSolution to Problem 1:\nTo find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point in a graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search algorithm.
