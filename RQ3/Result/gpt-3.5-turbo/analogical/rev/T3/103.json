Starting from the start node, we explore its neighboring nodes and enqueue them in a queue. We continue this process until we reach the destination node or all nodes have been visited. We also keep track of the parent node for each visited node to reconstruct the path once the destination node is found.\n\nProblem 2: Find the shortest path between two nodes in a directed weighted graph.\n\nDescription: Given a directed weighted graph represented by a list of nodes and a list of edges with weights, find the shortest path between a start node and a destination node.\n\nSolution: We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a directed weighted graph. Starting from the start node, we initialize the distances to all other nodes as infinity and the distance to the start node as 0. Then, we visit each neighboring node of the current node and update their distances if a shorter path is found. We continue this process until we reach the destination node or all nodes have been visited. We also keep track of the parent node for each visited node to reconstruct the path once the destination node is found.\n\nProblem 3: Find the shortest path between two nodes in a directed acyclic graph.\n\nDescription: Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) represented by a list of nodes and a list of edges, find the shortest path between a start node and a destination node.\n\nSolution: We can use Topological Sorting and Dynamic Programming to find the shortest path between two nodes in a directed acyclic graph. First, we perform a topological sorting to determine the order of visiting the nodes. Then, we initialize the distances to all other nodes as infinity and the distance to the start node as 0. We visit each node in the topological order and update their distances if a shorter path is found. We continue this process until we reach the destination node or all nodes have been visited.
