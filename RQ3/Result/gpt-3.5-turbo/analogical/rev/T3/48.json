Starting from node 0, we initialize the distance to all other nodes as infinity except for node 0 which has a distance of 0. Then, we visit the neighboring nodes of node 0 and update their distances if it is shorter. We continue this process until we reach node 2 and obtain the shortest path.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nSimilar to Problem 1, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between node 3 and node 7. Starting from node 3, we initialize the distance to all other nodes as infinity except for node 3 which has a distance of 0.

Starting from node 2, we initialize the distance to all other nodes as infinity except for node 2 which has a distance of 0. We visit the neighboring nodes of node 2 and update their distances if it is shorter.

Starting from node 0, we initialize the distance to all other nodes as infinity except for node 0 which has a distance of 0.
