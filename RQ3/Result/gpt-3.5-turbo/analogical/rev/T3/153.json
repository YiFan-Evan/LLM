Starting at the source node 0, we initialize the distance to all other nodes as infinity. We also keep track of the previous node for each node to reconstruct the path later. Then, we initialize a priority queue and insert the source node with a distance of 0. While the priority queue is not empty, we take the node with the smallest distance and update the distances of its neighbors. We also update the previous node for each neighbor.
