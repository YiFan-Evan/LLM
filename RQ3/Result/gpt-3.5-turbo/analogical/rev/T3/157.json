The algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to be explored, and at each step, selects the node with the smallest distance from the start node. We start by initializing the distances of all nodes as infinity, and the distance of the start node as 0. Then, we iteratively update the distances of neighboring nodes, until we reach the target node or there are no more nodes to explore.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 2 to node 9 in a given graph.\nSolution: We can use the same approach as in Problem 1, but this time starting from node 2 and target node as 9.\n\nProblem 3:\nDescription: Find the shortest path between two arbitrary nodes (specified by the user) in a given graph.\nSolution: We can modify the previous solutions by accepting the starting and target nodes as input from the user.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->11->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 2], [0, 12], [1, 11], [2, 11], [3, 7], [3, 5], [4, 6], [4, 14], [5, 10], [6, 13], [8, 13], [9, 11], [12, 13]]} The start node: 9 The destination: 11"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 9 to node 11 in a given graph.\nSolution: We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
