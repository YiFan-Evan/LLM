We start by initializing a distance list with all nodes except the starting node having a distance of infinity. Then we set the distance of the starting node to 0. We maintain a priority queue (min-heap) to store nodes based on their distances. We repeatedly extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue and update the distances of its neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found. We continue this process until all nodes have been visited or all reachable nodes have been processed. The final distances obtained form the shortest path from the starting node to all other nodes.\n\nProblem 2:\nGiven the graph and a starting point, find the shortest path from the starting point to a specific target point.\n\nSolution: \nThis problem can be solved by modifying Dijkstra's algorithm. We continue the process of finding the shortest path until either the target node is reached or all reachable nodes have been processed. Once the target node is reached, we stop the algorithm and the path found up to that point is the shortest path from the starting point to the target node.\n\nProblem 3:\nGiven the graph and a starting point, find the shortest path from the starting point to all other nodes while avoiding specific nodes.\n\nSolution: \nTo solve this problem, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm by adding a condition to exclude certain nodes from being considered during the pathfinding process. If a neighboring node is to be avoided, we simply skip it and move on to the next node. This way, we ensure that the resulting shortest path does not include the avoided nodes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->14->5->3->12->1"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 9], [3, 12], [3, 7], [3, 5], [5, 14], [6, 10], [6, 9], [7, 8], [7, 13], [9, 14], [11, 12]]} The start node: 9 The destination: 12"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1:\nGiven the graph and a starting point, find the shortest path from the starting point to all other nodes.\n\nSolution:\nThis problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm.
