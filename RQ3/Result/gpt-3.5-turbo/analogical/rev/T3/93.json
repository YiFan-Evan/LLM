This involves exploring all paths by depth-first search or breadth-first search algorithms.\n\n**Solution**: Start from the starting point and recursively traverse the graph, keeping track of the current path. When reaching the destination, add the path to the list of valid paths.\n\n**Related Problem 2**: Given the graph and a starting point, find the length of the shortest path to the destination.\n\n**Description**: In this problem, the goal is to find the length of the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. This involves finding the shortest path by utilizing algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search.\n\n**Solution**: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search starting from the starting point until reaching the destination, keeping track of the path length.\n\n**Related Problem 3**: Given the graph and a starting point, find the number of edges in the shortest path to the destination.\n\n**Description**: This problem involves finding the number of edges in the shortest path from the starting point to the destination. It is a simpler version of finding the shortest path compared to the second related problem.\n\n**Solution**: Use Dijkstra's algorithm or Breadth-First Search starting from the starting point and stop the search as soon as the destination is reached.
