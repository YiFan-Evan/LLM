We also create a priority queue to store the nodes and their distances.\n\n2) Relaxation: We visit each node in the graph and update its distance if a shorter path is found. To do this, we look at each edge connected to the current node and calculate the new distance as the sum of the current node's distance and the weight of the edge. If this new distance is smaller than the current distance of the connected node, we update it.\n\n3) Selection: We select the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue and mark it as visited.\n\n4) Termination: We repeat steps 2 and 3 until we have visited all nodes or the destination node is reached.\n\n5) Reconstruction: Once the destination node is reached, we can reconstruct the shortest path by backtracking from the destination node to the starting node using the recorded distances and previous nodes at each step.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4"}]
