During the search, we keep track of the current maximum path length and update it whenever a longer path is found.\n\n**Solution to Related Problem 2:**\nTo determine if there exists a cycle that includes both the starting node and the destination node in a graph, we can use depth-first search (DFS) starting from the starting node. While exploring the graph, if we reach the destination node and find a cycle, then such a cycle exists.\n\n**Solution to Related Problem 3:**\nTo find the shortest path from the starting node to the destination node that passes through a specific intermediate node, we can use two separate shortest path calculations. First, find the shortest path from the starting node to the intermediate node, and then find the shortest path from the intermediate node to the destination node. Finally, combine the two paths to form the shortest path that passes through the intermediate node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 8->3."}]
