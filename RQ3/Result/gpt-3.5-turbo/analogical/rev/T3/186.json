We start by initializing all nodes with a distance of infinity except for the starting node which has a distance of 0. We then visit each neighbor of the current node and update their distances if a shorter path is found. We repeat this process until we reach the target node or there are no more unvisited nodes. Once we reach the target node, we can backtrack from the target node to the starting node using the information of the previous node in the shortest path tree.\n\nSecond problem: Shortest path from node 5 to node 10.\n\nDescription: Given the same graph as before, find the shortest path from node 5 to node 10.\n\nSolution: We can again use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 10 in the given graph. The algorithm will work the same way as described in the first problem, but with different starting and target nodes.\n\nThird problem: Shortest path from node 12 to node 18.\n\nDescription: Given the same graph as before, find the shortest path from node 12 to node 18.\n\nSolution: Once again, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 12 to node 18 in the given graph.
