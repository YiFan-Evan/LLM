Problem: Given a graph with nodes and edges, determine if there exists a path from a given starting node to a specified target node.\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. We start from the starting node, explore all its neighbors recursively, and backtrack if the target node is not reached.\n\n3.

Problem: You are given a graph represented by nodes and edges, a starting node, and a target node. Find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.\n\nSolution: This problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm. We start by setting the distance to all nodes as infinity except for the starting node (distance of 0). Then, we continuously update the shortest distance to each node until we reach the target node.\n\n2. Problem: Given a graph with nodes and edges, determine if there exists a path from a specified starting node to a given target node.\n\nSolution: To solve this problem, we can employ the BFS algorithm. We start from the starting node, visit its neighbors level by level, and check if we encounter the target node during the traversal.\n\n3. Problem: Find the longest path in a graph from a given starting node to a destination node.\n\nSolution: To find the longest path, one approach is to modify the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Instead of finding the shortest path, we can keep track of the path with the maximum number of edges as we traverse the graph.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->4->9."}]
