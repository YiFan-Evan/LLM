We start by initializing a distance array with all distances set to infinity, except for the start node, which is set to 0. We also maintain a visited array to keep track of the nodes we have already visited.\n\nNext, we iterate until we have visited all nodes or until we reach the destination node. In each iteration, we choose the node with the minimum distance from the start node, mark it as visited, and update the distances of its neighbors. We continue this process until we either visit all nodes or reach the destination node.\n\nFinally, we can reconstruct the shortest path by backtracking from the destination node to the start node using the parent information stored during the Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nSecond related problem:\nGiven the graph, find the shortest path from node 4 to node 21.\n\nSolution:\nTo find the shortest path from node 4 to node 21, we can use the same approach as in the first problem. We start from node 4 and apply Dijkstra's algorithm until we reach node 21 or visit all nodes. Then, we reconstruct the shortest path from node 4 to node 21 using the parent information.\n\nThird related problem:\nGiven the graph, find the shortest path from node 2 to node 7.\n\nSolution:\nTo find the shortest path from node 2 to node 7, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm.

Here is how we can solve the problem:\n\n1. Initialize a distance array with all distances set to infinity, except for the start node, which is set to 0. We also initialize a visited array to keep track of the nodes we have already visited.\n\n2. Create a priority queue (min heap) to store nodes based on their distances from the start node. Insert the start node with distance 0 into the priority queue.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue.\n   b. If the extracted node is the destination node, break out of the loop.\n   c. Mark the extracted node as visited.\n   d. For each neighbor of the extracted node, calculate the distance from the start node through the extracted node. If this distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighbor, update its distance and set its parent node as the extracted node.\n   e. Insert the updated neighbors into the priority queue.\n\n4. Once we have visited all nodes or reached the destination node, we can reconstruct the shortest path by backtracking from the destination node to the start node using the parent information stored during the algorithm.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->18->8"}]
