We start from the starting node, explore its neighbors, then continue to the neighbors of the neighbors until we reach the target node.\n\n2. **Description:** Given a weighted graph represented as nodes and edges, find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node.\n\n*Solution:* Dijkstra's algorithm can be used to find the shortest path in weighted graphs. It maintains a priority queue of nodes to visit next based on the current shortest distance found.\n\n3. **Description:** Given a graph represented as nodes and edges, find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node that visits specified intermediate nodes along the way.\n\n*Solution:* This problem can be solved by modifying Dijkstra's algorithm or using A* search by incorporating the intermediate nodes as additional constraints in the pathfinding process.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"3->1->4->0\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 3], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The start node: 3 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **Description:** Given a graph represented as nodes and edges, find the path from a starting node to a target node.\n\n*Solution:* We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the path from the starting node to the target node.
