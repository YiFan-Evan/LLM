Starting from the given starting point, we explore all the neighbors of each node in the graph using a queue. We visit each neighbor node and mark it as visited. We repeat this process until we reach the target point or exhaust all possible paths. Once we reach the target point, we can backtrack from the target node to the starting node to obtain the shortest path.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Given a graph, a starting point, and a target point, find the number of edges in the shortest path from the starting point to the target point.\nSolution: Similar to problem 1, we can use the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path. However, instead of backtracking from the target node to the starting node, we can keep track of the number of edges visited while exploring the graph. Once we reach the target point, we can return the number of edges as the result.\n\nProblem 3:\nDescription: Given a graph, a starting point, and a target point, determine if there exists a path from the starting point to the target point.\nSolution: We can solve this problem using the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm. Starting from the given starting point, we explore all the neighbors of each node in the graph using a queue. We visit each neighbor node and mark it as visited. If we reach the target point during the exploration, that means a path exists from the starting point to the target point. Otherwise, if we exhaust all possible paths and do not reach the target point, then there is no path from the starting point to the target point.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7 -> 4 -> 2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [1, 6], [1, 8], [1, 9], [1, 12], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 8], [4, 7], [5, 12], [9, 11], [10, 11]]} The start node: 7 The destination:  4 "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1:\nDescription: Given a graph, a starting point, and a target point, find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point.\nSolution: We can solve this problem using the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm.
