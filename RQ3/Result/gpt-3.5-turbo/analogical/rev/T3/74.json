Problem: Find the shortest path from node 0 to node 1.\n   - Solution: Since node 0 and node 1 are directly connected by an edge, the shortest path is simply \"0->1\".\n\n2. Problem: Find the shortest path from node 5 to node 3.\n   - Solution: The graph does not contain a direct edge between node 5 and node 3. However, we can find the shortest path by going through intermediate nodes. In this case, the shortest path would be \"5->0->6->7->2->3\".\n\n3.
