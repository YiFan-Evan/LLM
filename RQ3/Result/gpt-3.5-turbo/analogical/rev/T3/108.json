We can use dynamic programming and store the optimal solutions to subproblems in a memoization table. Starting from the starting point, we recursively calculate the shortest path considering all possible next nodes and select the path with the minimum weight. Finally, we return the shortest path found.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find the shortest path to visit a specific set of nodes and return to the starting point, we can modify the TSP algorithm. In this case, we consider only the nodes in the specific set and find the shortest path to visit all these nodes exactly once and return to the starting point.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find the shortest path from one node to another in a graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Starting from the source node, we keep track of the shortest distance to each node and also keep track of the previous node on the shortest path. We iteratively select the node with the smallest distance and update the distance to its neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.

The algorithm uses dynamic programming to calculate the shortest path that visits all nodes exactly once and returns to the starting point. We can build a memoization table to store the optimal subpaths and ultimately find the shortest path.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo solve this problem, we can modify the Held-Karp algorithm by restricting the set of nodes to be visited. Instead of considering all nodes in the graph, we only take into account the specific set of nodes we need to visit before returning to the starting point.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find the shortest path from one node to another in a graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm keeps track of the shortest distance from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph. By using a priority queue to select the next node with the smallest distance, we can efficiently find the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->0->6->5->2"}]
