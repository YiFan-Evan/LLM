This algorithm explores all the neighboring nodes of a node before moving on to the next level of nodes.

This algorithm starts with an initial distance of infinity for all nodes except the starting node, which has a distance of 0.

This algorithm uses a heuristic function to estimate the cost of reaching the target from each node and selects the path with the lowest estimated cost.
