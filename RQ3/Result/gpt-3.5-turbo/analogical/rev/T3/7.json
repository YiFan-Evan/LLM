We need to find the shortest path from a given start node to a target node. We can solve this problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.\n\n   **Solution:** We start from the given start node and explore all its neighbors. Then, we move to their neighbors until we reach the target node. BFS ensures that we visit nodes level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path for unweighted graphs.\n\n2. **Problem:** Find the shortest path between two points in an undirected graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n\n   **Description:** In this problem, we have an undirected graph represented as nodes and edges. We need to find the shortest path from a given start node to a target node. We can solve this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm, which works for weighted graphs as well.\n\n   **Solution:** Dijkstra's algorithm starts from the start node and assigns tentative distances to all other nodes. It then iteratively selects the node with the smallest tentative distance, updates the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found, and marks it as visited. This process continues until the target node is reached.\n\n3. **Problem:** Find the shortest path between two points in an undirected graph using A* Algorithm.\n\n   **Description:** In this problem, we have an undirected graph represented as nodes and edges. We need to find the shortest path from a given start node to a target node with a heuristic function to guide the search. We can solve this problem using the A* algorithm.\n\n   **Solution:** A* algorithm combines elements of Dijkstra's algorithm and Greedy Best-First Search. It uses a heuristic function (like the Euclidean distance) in addition to the actual cost to reach the target. This way, it explores paths by balancing the cost to reach a node and the estimations of the cost to reach the target.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->1->3->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 7], [1, 4], [1, 3], [2, 5], [3, 6], [3, 7]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **Problem:** Find the shortest path between two points in an undirected graph using Breadth-First Search Algorithm.\n\n   **Description:** In this problem, we have an undirected graph represented as nodes and edges.
