We start at the starting point, keep track of the shortest distance to each node, and update the distances as we traverse the graph. Finally, we can backtrack from the target point to the starting point to find the shortest path.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find the longest path from a starting point to a target point, we can modify the Dijkstra's algorithm. Instead of keeping track of the shortest distance, we keep track of the longest distance to each node. We can also modify the backtracking step to find the longest path from the target point to the starting point.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find all possible paths from a starting point to a target point, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm. We start at the starting point, recursively explore all possible paths, and store each valid path we encounter.
