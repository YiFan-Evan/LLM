We start by initializing a queue and pushing the starting point into the queue. Then, we iterate until the queue is empty. At each iteration, we dequeue a node from the queue and check if it is the target point. If it is, we return the shortest path. Otherwise, we enqueue all the neighboring nodes that have not been visited yet. We also keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path at the end. If we reach the end of the iterations without finding the target point, there is no path from the starting point to the target point.\n\nProblem 2:\nGiven a graph with nodes and edges, a starting point, and a target point, find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point while avoiding a specific node.\n\nSolution 2:\nTo solve this problem, we can modify the breadth-first search algorithm used in Solution 1. Instead of enqueuing neighboring nodes that have not been visited yet, we only enqueue those that have not been visited and are not equal to the node we want to avoid. This way, we ensure that the path does not pass through the avoided node.\n\nProblem 3:\nGiven a weighted graph with nodes and edges, a starting point, and a target point, find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point, considering the weights on the edges.\n\nSolution 3:\nThe previous solutions assume an unweighted graph. However, if the graph has edge weights, we need to modify the algorithm by assigning each edge a weight. Instead of simply enqueuing neighboring nodes, we enqueue all nodes connected to the current node and calculate the weight of each potential path. We keep track of the smallest weight discovered so far and the corresponding shortest path.
