The algorithm works by exploring all possible paths from the start node to other nodes in the graph and keeping track of the shortest distance and path for each node. Here's how the algorithm works:\n\n1. Initialize the distance of all nodes except the start node to infinity and the distance of the start node to 0.\n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. Create a priority queue to store nodes with their corresponding distances, with the start node as the first element.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - Mark the dequeued node as visited.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node:\n     * Calculate the distance from the start node to the neighbor through the dequeued node.\n     * If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighbor, update the neighbor's distance and update the shortest path to the neighbor.\n     * If the neighbor is not visited, enqueue the neighbor with its updated distance into the priority queue.\n5. After exploring all possible paths, the shortest path to the target node is determined.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->4->3->1->5"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 7], [1, 5], [1, 3], [2, 7], [3, 4], [4, 6]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 6 to node 3.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4.\n\nProblem 3:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 2 to node 5.\n\nSolution:\nFollowing the same approach using Dijkstra's algorithm as described earlier, we can calculate the shortest path between the start node and the destination node in the given graph.
