Start from the starting point and explore neighboring nodes recursively until the target point is reached. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles. Return the path once the target point is found.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point, we can use the Dijkstra's algorithm. Start from the starting point and initialize the distances to all other nodes as infinity except for the starting point which is set to 0. Then, iteratively select the node with the shortest distance and update the distances to its adjacent nodes if a shorter path is found. Continue this process until the target point is reached and return the shortest path.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find the longest path from the starting point to the target point, we can use a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm. Instead of minimizing the distance, we maximize it. Start from the starting point and initialize the distances to all other nodes as negative infinity except for the starting point which is set to 0.
