By exploring all possible paths with BFS, we can keep track of the path with the most nodes and return it.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Given a graph, a starting point, and a target point, find the shortest path from the target point to the starting point.\nSolution: We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the target point to the starting point in a graph. By reversing the direction of the edges in the graph, we can treat the target point as the starting point and vice versa, then apply Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\nProblem 3:\nDescription: Given a graph, a starting point, and a target point, find the longest path from the target point to the starting point.\nSolution: We can modify the breadth-first search algorithm to find the longest path from the target point to the starting point.
