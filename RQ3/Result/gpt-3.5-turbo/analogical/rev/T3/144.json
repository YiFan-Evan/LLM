We start by initializing a queue and enqueue the start node. Then, while the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found the shortest path. Otherwise, we enqueue all the neighboring nodes that have not been visited yet and update their parent node to be the current node. We continue this process until either the target node is found or the queue is empty. If the queue becomes empty without finding the target node, it means that there is no path from the start node to the target node.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find the shortest path from a start node to a target node, allowing for multiple paths to have the same length, we can modify the BFS algorithm. Instead of stopping the algorithm once the target node is found, we continue the search until we have visited all the nodes in the graph. This way, we will find all the shortest paths from the start node to the target node.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find all the shortest paths from a start node to a target node, we can modify the BFS algorithm slightly. Instead of stopping the algorithm once the target node is found, we continue the search until we have visited all the nodes in the graph. However, during the search, we need to keep track of all the paths that lead to the target node. We can do this by using a data structure (such as a dictionary) to store the parent-child relationships between nodes. Once we have visited all the nodes, we can backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent-child relationships and generate all the possible paths.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 11->0->3->12->4->13"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 11], [1, 9], [2, 6], [3, 12], [3, 10], [4, 13], [4, 10], [5, 6], [6, 13], [7, 11], [7, 9], [8, 11], [9, 14]]} The start node: 11 The destination: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1:\nGiven a graph, find the shortest path from a start node to a target node.\n\nProblem 2:\nGiven a graph, find the shortest path from a start node to a target node, allowing for multiple paths to have the same length.\n\nProblem 3:\nGiven a graph, find all the shortest paths from a start node to a target node.\n\nSolution to Problem 1:\nTo find the shortest path from a start node to a target node, we can use a modified version of the Breadth First Search (BFS) algorithm.
