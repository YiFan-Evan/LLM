We start by initializing a distance array with all distances set to infinity, except for the distance from the start node which is set to 0. We also initialize a visited array to keep track of visited nodes. Then, we repeatedly choose the unvisited node with the smallest distance, visit its neighbors, and update their distances if necessary. Finally, we construct the shortest path from the start node to node 2 by backtracking from node 2 to its parent until we reach the start node.\n\nSolution for Problem 2: We can also solve this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm. We initialize the distance array and visited array as before, but this time, we start from node 4 and look for the shortest path to node 7.\n\nSolution for Problem 3: Again, we can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to solve this problem. We start from node 1 and search for the shortest path to node 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->0->2->4"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 4], [1, 3], [1, 5], [2, 4], [2, 6], [2, 7]]} The start node: 5 The destination: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Find the shortest path from node 3 to node 7.\nProblem 2: Find the shortest path from node 0 to node 6.\nProblem 3: Find the shortest path from node 5 to node 1.\n\nSolution for Problem 1: Apply Dijkstra's algorithm starting from node 3 to find the shortest path to node 7.\n\nSolution for Problem 2: Use Dijkstra's algorithm with the starting node being 0 and look for the shortest path to node 6.\n\nSolution for Problem 3: Implement Dijkstra's algorithm starting from node 5 and search for the shortest path to node 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->1->3->2"}]
