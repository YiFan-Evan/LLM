We start from the starting point and explore all reachable nodes, keeping track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the path later. Once we reach the target point, we can backtrack from the target point to the starting point using the recorded parent information to find the shortest path.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Given a graph, a starting point, and a target point, find the number of edges in the shortest path from the starting point to the target point.\nSolution: To find the number of edges in the shortest path from the starting point to the target point, we can modify the solution of Problem 1 slightly. Instead of keeping track of the parent of each node, we can keep track of the number of edges traversed to reach each node. Once we reach the target point, we will have the number of edges in the shortest path.\n\nProblem 3:\nDescription: Given a graph, a starting point, and a target point, determine if there exists a path between the starting point and the target point.\nSolution: To determine if there exists a path between the starting point and the target point, we can again use graph search algorithms like Breadth First Search (BFS) or Depth First Search (DFS).
