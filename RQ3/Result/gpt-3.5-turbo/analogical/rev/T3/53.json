Keep track of the distance from the starting node to each visited node and stop the traversal once the destination node is reached.\n\n**Related Problem 2:**\n\n**Description:** Given the same graph, starting node, and an additional target node, find the shortest path from the starting node to this new target node.\n\n**Solution:** Again, employ graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path from the starting node to the new target node. Modify the stopping condition from the original target node to the new target node.\n\n**Related Problem 3:**\n\n**Description:** Given the same graph and starting node, find all possible paths to reach all the other nodes in the graph.\n\n**Solution:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph.

Count the number of edges traversed from the starting node to the destination node as the distance of the shortest path.\n\n**Related Problem 2:**\n\n**Description:** Given the same graph, starting node, and destination node, find the longest path from the starting node to the destination node.\n\n**Solution:** Instead of finding the shortest path, employ algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the graph and find the longest path from the starting node to the destination node. Keep track of visited nodes and the longest path encountered.\n\n**Related Problem 3:**\n\n**Description:** Given the same graph and starting node, find all possible paths from the starting node that do not include the destination node.\n\n**Solution:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths from the starting node to other nodes while avoiding the destination node. Track visited nodes and paths to ensure the destination node is not included in the paths.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** 6->3->0"}]
