We start by initializing all nodes with a distance of infinity except for the starting node, which has a distance of 0. Then, we visit each node in the graph and update their distances based on the current shortest path.

Starting from the starting point, we explore the graph by visiting neighboring nodes until we reach the target point or all nodes have been visited. If we reach the target point, a path exists.\n\nProblem 3: To find the number of different paths, we can use breadth-first search (BFS). Starting from the starting point, we explore the graph by visiting neighboring nodes until we reach the target point or all nodes have been visited.
