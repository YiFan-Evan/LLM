Starting from the starting point, we visit its neighbors and enqueue them. We repeat this process until we find the target point or the queue becomes empty. To keep track of the visited nodes and the path taken, we can use an additional visited list and a dictionary to store the parent of each visited node.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find the longest path from the starting point to the target point in a graph, we can use the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. Starting from the starting point, we explore all possible paths until we reach the target point or there are no more unvisited nodes.
