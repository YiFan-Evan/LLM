Start by enqueueing the starting point into a queue, and keep a track of visited nodes. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and check if it is the target point. If it is, reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target point to the starting point using a parent dictionary. If it is not the target point, enqueue its neighbors that have not been visited yet and update the parent dictionary. Repeat this process until either the target point is found or all nodes have been visited.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Given a graph, starting point, and target point, find the longest path from the starting point to the target point.\nSolution: Use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to find the path from the starting point to the target point in the graph. Start by visiting the starting point and keep a track of visited nodes. Explore each neighbor recursively until the target point is reached or no other unvisited neighbors are available.\n\nProblem 3:\nDescription: Given a graph, starting point, and target point, determine if there is a path from the starting point to the target point.\nSolution: Use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the graph starting from the starting point.
