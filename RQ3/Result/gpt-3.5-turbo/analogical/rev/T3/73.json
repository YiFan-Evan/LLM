Starting at a particular node in the graph, you need to find the shortest path to a specified target node.\n\n**Solution 1:**\nThis problem can be solved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, which explores all the neighboring nodes of the current node before moving on to the next level of nodes. By keeping track of the path taken, we can determine the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nGiven a directed graph and a starting point, find the longest path to a target point.\n\n**Description 2:**\nSimilar to the first problem, you have a directed graph with nodes and edges provided. Starting at a particular node in the graph, you need to find the longest path to a specified target node.\n\n**Solution 2:**\nThis problem can be approached using a topological sorting of the graph followed by dynamic programming to find the longest path from the starting node to the target node.

Starting at a specific node in the graph, you need to find the shortest path with the minimum total weight to a target node.\n\n**Solution 3:**\nThis problem can be solved using Dijkstra's algorithm, which iteratively selects the node with the smallest distance from the starting node and relaxes its neighboring nodes accordingly.
