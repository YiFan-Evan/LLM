We also initialize an empty list called \"previous\" with the same length, and set all values to None. We set the distance of the starting node (node 7) to 0.\n\nNext, we create a priority queue called \"unvisited\" and add the starting node along with its distance (0) to the queue.\n\nWhile the priority queue is not empty, we remove the node with the smallest distance from the queue. For each of its neighbors, we calculate the distance from the starting node. If this distance is smaller than the current value in \"distances\" for that neighbor, we update the value in \"distances\" and set the previous node for that neighbor to the current node.\n\nFinally, we can backtrack from the target node (node 1) by following the previous nodes until we reach the starting node (node 7).
