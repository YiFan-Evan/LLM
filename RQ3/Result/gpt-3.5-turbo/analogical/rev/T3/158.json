Start from the source node, enqueue it in a queue, mark it as visited, and continue until the queue is empty. Dequeue a node from the queue and check if it is the target node. If it is, return the distance. Otherwise, enqueue all the adjacent nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet and mark them as visited.

When enqueueing an adjacent node, we also store its parent node. After finding the target node, we can backtrack from the target node to the source node using the parent nodes to reconstruct the shortest path.\n\nThird problem: Find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph.\n\nDescription: Given a weighted graph and two nodes, find the shortest path between the two nodes. In this case, the edges have assigned weights.\n\nSolution: To find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph, we can modify the BFS algorithm by using a priority queue instead of a regular queue. The priority queue should prioritize nodes with lower cumulative weights. Additionally, we need to maintain an array to store the current cumulative weight for each visited node. When enqueueing an adjacent node, we update its cumulative weight and insert it into the priority queue accordingly. Finally, after finding the target node, we can backtrack from the target node to the source node using the parent nodes to reconstruct the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"9->5->9->10->2\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 8], [0, 7], [2, 7], [2, 14], [3, 10], [4, 7], [5, 9], [6, 11], [6, 7], [7, 12], [8, 10], [9, 10], [12, 13]]} The start node: 9 The destination: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "First problem: Find the distance between two nodes in a graph.\n\nDescription: Given a graph and two nodes, find the distance between the two nodes, that is, the number of edges in the shortest path between them.\n\nSolution: We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path between the two nodes.

In this case, the edges have assigned weights.\n\nSolution: To find the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Start from the source node and assign a distance of zero to it. Assign infinity to all other nodes. Create a priority queue and enqueue the source node with a priority of zero. While the priority queue is not empty, dequeue a node. If the dequeued node is the target node, we have found the shortest path and we can backtrack from the target node to the source node to reconstruct the path. Otherwise, for each adjacent node, calculate a tentative distance by adding the weight of the current edge to the distance of the current node. If the tentative distance is less than the distance of the adjacent node, update the distance of the adjacent node and enqueue it in the priority queue with the new distance as its priority. Repeat this process until the priority queue is empty or the target node is found.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"9->10\"."}]
