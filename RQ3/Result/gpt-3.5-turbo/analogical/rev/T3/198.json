We start by initializing the distance to all nodes from node 3 as infinity except for node 3 itself which is set to 0. Then, we iterate through the graph to update the distances. At each step, we select the node with the minimum distance and update the distances of its neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found. We repeat this process until we reach node 22 or until we have visited all nodes. Finally, we can trace back the path from node 22 to node 3 using the distances and the previous node information.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find the shortest path from node 6 to node 4, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm.
