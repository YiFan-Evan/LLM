After running Dijkstra's algorithm, we return the shortest path length.\n\n**Similar Problem 2:**\n\n**Description:** In the same graph, starting from the given starting node, find the node that is furthest away (longest path) from the starting node.\n\n**Solution:** To solve this problem, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to find the longest paths from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph. Then, we return the node that has the longest path from the starting node.\n\n**Similar Problem 3:**\n\n**Description:** In the same graph, starting from the given starting node, find the number of different paths of length exactly K from the starting node to the destination node.\n\n**Solution:** To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to count the number of different paths of length K from the starting node to the destination node. We iterate over paths of increasing length up to K, updating the count of different paths at each node.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\n6->14->12"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 12], [1, 8], [1, 13], [2, 13], [2, 12], [3, 10], [3, 13], [4, 9], [5, 12], [5, 6], [6, 7], [6, 14], [8, 9], [9, 11]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 14"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "**Similar Problem 1:**\n\n**Description:** Given the same graph, starting node, and destination node, find the number of edges in the shortest path from the starting node to the destination node.\n\n**Solution:** This problem can be solved by running Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between the starting node and the destination node.

We keep track of visited nodes to avoid counting the same path multiple times.\n\n**Similar Problem 3:**\n\n**Description:** In the same graph, determine if there exists a path from the starting node to the destination node that goes through a specific intermediate node.\n\n**Solution:** To solve this problem, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm to consider the specific intermediate node while finding the shortest path from the starting node to the destination node. If there exists a path that goes through the intermediate node, we return true; otherwise, we return false.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:**\n6->14"}]
