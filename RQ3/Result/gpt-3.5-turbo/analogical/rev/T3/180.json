We can adapt the algorithm to stop the search when we reach the destination node. We will use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes to be explored. We start with the start node, initialize its distance as 0, and add it to the priority queue. While the priority queue is not empty, we pop the node with the smallest distance, check if it is the destination node, and if so, return the path to it. Otherwise, we check all its neighboring nodes and update their distances if a shorter path is found.
