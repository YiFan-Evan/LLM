The algorithm works as follows:\n1. Create an empty set called \"visited\" and a dictionary called \"distances\" with the key being each node in the graph and the value being infinity except for the starting point, which has a distance of 0.\n2. Create a priority queue called \"queue\" and add the starting point along with its distance to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue the node with the smallest distance from the queue.\n   b. If the dequeued node is the target point, stop the algorithm and return the shortest path.\n   c. If the dequeued node is not in the visited set, do the following:\n      - Add it to the visited set.\n      - Update the distances of its neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.\n      - Enqueue the neighboring nodes along with their distances into the queue.\n4. If the algorithm finishes without finding the target point, it means there is no path from the starting point to the target point.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find the longest path from the starting point to the target point in a graph, we can modify Dijkstra's algorithm by changing the priority queue to keep track of the maximum distance instead of the minimum distance. The rest of the algorithm remains the same.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find the number of different paths from the starting point to the target point in a graph, we can use a recursive function that explores all possible paths. Starting from the starting point, the function will recursively explore all neighboring nodes until the target point is reached. Each time a path reaches the target point, we increment the count of different paths. We continue exploring other paths until all possible paths have been explored. The function will return the count of different paths.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"12->7->1\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 20], [0, 4], [1, 22], [1, 11], [2, 11], [2, 18], [3, 4], [3, 11], [5, 14], [6, 13], [6, 22], [7, 12], [7, 23], [7, 15], [8, 23], [9, 21], [10, 14], [10, 24], [14, 15], [15, 16], [15, 18], [16, 19], [17, 18], [18, 21]]} The start node: 12 The destination: 7"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1:\nGiven a graph, starting point, and target point, find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point.\n\nProblem 2:\nGiven a graph, starting point, and target point, find the longest path from the starting point to the target point.\n\nProblem 3:\nGiven a graph, starting point, and target point, find the number of different paths from the starting point to the target point.\n\nSolution to Problem 1:\nTo find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point in a graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm.
