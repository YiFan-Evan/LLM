Start by initializing an empty set of visited nodes and a priority queue. Add the starting node to the queue with a distance of 0. While the queue is not empty, remove the node with the minimum distance from the queue. If this node is the target node, we have found the shortest path. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node that is not visited, calculate the distance from the starting node, and add it to the queue.
