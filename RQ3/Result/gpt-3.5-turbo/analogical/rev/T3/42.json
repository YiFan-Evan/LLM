Create a visited set and add node 0 to it.\n4. Create a path dictionary to keep track of the path from the start node to each node. Initialize it with {0: None}.\n5. While the queue is not empty, remove the first node from the queue and assign it to the current node.\n6. If the current node is the destination node, reconstruct the path using the path dictionary and return it.\n7. Otherwise, check all the neighbors of the current node that have not been visited.
