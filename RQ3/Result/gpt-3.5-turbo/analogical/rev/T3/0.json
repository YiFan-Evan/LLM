Related problem: Finding the longest path in an unweighted graph\nDescription: Given an unweighted graph represented as nodes and edges, find the longest path between a start node and a target node.\nSolution: This problem is NP-hard, so finding the longest path in an unweighted graph is generally not feasible. However, we can modify the graph by assigning negative weights to all the edges and then find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n\n2. Related problem: Finding the shortest path in a graph with negative weights\nDescription: Given a weighted graph (with negative edge weights) represented as nodes and edges, find the shortest path between a start node and a target node.\nSolution: Use Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph with negative weights. Start from the start node and relax edges repeatedly until reaching the target node. Keep track of the shortest distances to each node and the path followed.\n\n3. Related problem: Finding the shortest path in a weighted graph with positive cycles\nDescription: Given a weighted graph (with positive cycles) represented as nodes and edges, find the shortest path between a start node and a target node.\nSolution: Use Johnson's algorithm to find the shortest path in a graph with positive cycles. First, add a new node connected to every other node with an edge of weight 0. Then, use Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate the shortest path from the new node to every other node. Finally, use Dijkstra's algorithm for each node to find the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->7"}]
