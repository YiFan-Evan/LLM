We start by assigning a distance of infinity to all nodes except the starting point, which is assigned a distance of 0. Then, we visit each node and update its neighbors' distances if a shorter path is found. We continue this process until we reach the target point or there are no more reachable nodes. Finally, we backtrack from the target point to the starting point using the recorded distances to get the shortest path.\n\nDescription of problem 2 solution:\nTo find the length of the shortest path from the starting point to the target point in the given graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm as described in problem 1. After finding the shortest path, we can sum up the weights of the edges in the path to calculate its length.\n\nDescription of problem 3 solution:\nTo determine if there exists a path from the starting point to the target point in the given graph, we can use depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. Starting from the starting point, we explore all neighboring nodes using either BFS or DFS and keep track of visited nodes.
