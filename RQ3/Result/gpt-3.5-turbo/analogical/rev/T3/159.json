Starting from node 0, we explore all connected nodes and enqueue them. We continue this process until we reach node 13 or all nodes have been visited.

Starting from node 7, we explore all connected nodes and enqueue them. We continue this process until we reach node 8 or all nodes have been visited. Finally, we trace back from node 8 to node 7 to obtain the shortest path.\n\nProblem 3: Find the shortest path from node 11 to node 4 in the given graph.\n\nDescription: Given a graph, find the shortest path from node 11 to node 4.\n\nSolution: Again, we can use the breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path. Starting from node 11, we explore all connected nodes and enqueue them. We continue this process until we reach node 4 or all nodes have been visited. Finally, we trace back from node 4 to node 11 to obtain the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->9->1->4->7->8->9->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 5], [1, 4], [1, 9], [1, 13], [2, 3], [2, 12], [3, 10], [4, 7], [5, 9], [6, 9], [8, 9], [10, 13], [11, 12], [12, 14]]} The start node: 5 The destination: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Find the shortest path from node 0 to node 11 in the given graph.\n\nDescription: Given a graph, find the shortest path from node 0 to node 11.\n\nSolution: We can apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 0 to node 11. Dijkstra's algorithm is a more efficient way to find the shortest path compared to Breadth-First Search. It works by iteratively selecting the node with the lowest distance from the start node.\n\nProblem 2: Find the shortest path from node 3 to node 14 in the given graph.\n\nDescription: Given a graph, find the shortest path from node 3 to node 14.\n\nSolution: We can use Dijkstra's algorithm again to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 14 in the given graph.\n\nProblem 3: Find the shortest path from node 6 to node 10 in the given graph.\n\nDescription: Given a graph, find the shortest path from node 6 to node 10.\n\nSolution: We can once more apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 10 in the given graph.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->9"}]
