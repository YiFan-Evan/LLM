We start by initializing an empty queue and a list to keep track of visited nodes. We add the starting point to the queue and mark it as visited. While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node from the front of the queue. If the dequeued node is the destination point, we have found the shortest path. Otherwise, we enqueue all the neighbors of the dequeued node that have not been visited, and mark them as visited. We also keep track of the parent of each visited node to reconstruct the shortest path. Finally, we start from the destination point and traverse back through the parent nodes until we reach the starting point, recording the nodes in reverse order to get the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->9->8->6->10"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 14], [0, 15], [1, 9], [2, 7], [3, 23], [5, 15], [5, 12], [6, 10], [6, 12], [6, 24], [7, 18], [7, 23], [7, 15], [8, 10], [9, 17], [9, 20], [9, 24], [11, 12], [13, 23], [14, 16], [16, 22], [19, 24], [21, 22]]} The start node: 1 The destination: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Description of the three related problems:\n\n1.

We start by initializing a priority queue (min heap) with the starting point and its distance as 0. We also initialize a distance array to store the shortest distance from the starting point to each node. While the priority queue is not empty, we dequeue the node with the shortest distance. For each neighbor of this node, we calculate the distance if we choose to go through the current node, and if it is shorter than the previously recorded distance, we update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue. We continue this process until we dequeue the destination node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->9->8->6"}]
