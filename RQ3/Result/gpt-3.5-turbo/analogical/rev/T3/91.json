Starting from node 0, we explore all its neighboring nodes and mark them as visited. Then, we continue exploring the neighbors of the visited nodes until we reach the target node 12.

We start from node 5, explore its neighbors, mark them as visited, and continue exploring their neighbors until we reach the target node 9. By recording the path taken, we can obtain the shortest path from node 5 to node 9.\n\nProblem 3 Solution:\nAgain, the breadth-first search algorithm can be used to find the shortest path from node 7 to node 1. We start from node 7, explore its neighbors, mark them as visited, and continue exploring their neighbors until we reach the target node 1.
