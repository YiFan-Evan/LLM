We start from the starting node and maintain a priority queue of nodes to visit next. Initially, the distance to all nodes except the starting node is set to infinity. We update the distances of the neighboring nodes and repeat the process until we reach the destination node.

Instead of storing the distances of the nodes, we can store the number of edges traveled to each node. When we reach the destination node, the number of edges traveled will be the number of edges in the shortest path.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo determine if there exists a path between two nodes, we can use the same approach as in Problem 1.
