Your task is to find the shortest path from a given starting node to a target node.\n\n   - **Solution**: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to traverse the graph from the starting node until the target node is found. Keep track of the path taken. Once the target node is reached, reconstruct the path from the starting node to the target node.\n\n2. **Problem**: Finding the shortest path between two points in a grid with obstacles.\n\n   - **Description**: Consider a grid representing a map where some cells are obstacles, and you can only move up, down, left, or right. Given a start point and a target point, determine the shortest path from the start to the target while avoiding obstacles.\n\n   - **Solution**: Apply the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm on the grid, treating obstacles as inaccessible cells. Explore neighboring cells and mark them as visited to avoid revisiting them. Keep track of the path taken and reconstruct it once the target cell is reached.\n\n3. **Problem**: Shortest path in a weighted graph.\n\n   - **Description**: Given a weighted graph with nodes and weighted edges, find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node, considering the weights on the edges.\n\n   - **Solution**: Instead of using a simple BFS, use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph.
