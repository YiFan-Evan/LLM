We start exploring the graph from the starting node and keep track of the distance from the starting node to each node until we reach the destination.

Instead of just finding the shortest path, we can keep track of all possible paths from the starting node to the destination node that have the same minimum length.

Next, we modify the graph by removing one edge at a time that is part of the shortest path found earlier. We then run the BFS algorithm again on this modified graph to find the second shortest path.
