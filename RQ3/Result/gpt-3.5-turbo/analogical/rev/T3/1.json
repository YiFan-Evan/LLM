Starting from node 0, we visit all the connected nodes and keep track of the previous node for each visited node. We continue this process until we reach node 3.

By updating the distances to each node based on the edge weights, we can find the shortest path to node 7.\n\nProblem 2: Similarly, to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 6, we can apply Dijkstra's algorithm, starting from node 3 and examining the edges to reach node 6 via the shortest path.\n\nProblem 3: To find the shortest path from node 0 to node 4, we can again use Dijkstra's algorithm, beginning from node 0 and traversing the graph to find the shortest path to node 4.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->5"}]
