Find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nSolution 1:\nTo find the shortest path from node 5 to node 2, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. Dijkstra's algorithm is a weighted graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. We initialize the distance to the starting node as 0 and all other distances as infinite. We then repeatedly select the node with the smallest distance, update the distance to its neighbors, and continue until we reach the destination node.\n\nProblem 2:\nGiven the graph {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 5], [1, 2], [1, 5], [3, 6], [4, 5], [5, 7]]}, the start node is 5, and the destination is 7.

Dijkstra's algorithm will help us find the shortest path by considering the weights of the edges.
