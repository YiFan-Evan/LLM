Starting from the starting node, we explore all neighboring nodes before moving on to the next level of neighbors until we reach the target node. During the exploration, we keep track of the parent of each node to reconstruct the shortest path.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find the longest path between a starting node and a target node in a graph, we can modify the BFS algorithm. Instead of stopping the exploration when we reach the target node, we continue exploring all paths until we have visited all nodes in the graph. We keep track of the maximum path length and the corresponding path.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find all possible paths between a starting node and a target node in a graph, we can use a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.
