Starting from the given start cell, we explore all adjacent cells and keep track of the distance from the start cell. We continue this process until we reach the target cell or explore all the cells.\n\nProblem 2: Shortest Path in a Directed Graph\nDescription: Given a directed graph with nodes and edges, find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node.\nSolution: We can use a breadth-first search algorithm or Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a directed graph. Starting from the given start node, we explore all the neighbors and keep track of the distance from the start node. We continue this process until we reach the target node or explore all the nodes.\n\nProblem 3: Shortest Path in a Weighted Graph\nDescription: Given a weighted graph with nodes and edges, find the shortest path from a starting node to a target node.\nSolution: We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. Starting from the given start node, we explore all the neighbors and keep track of the minimum distance to each node.
