Given a graph and a starting point, find all possible paths to a target point.\n2. Given a graph and a starting point, find the shortest path to a target point by using Dijkstra's algorithm.\n3. Given a graph and a starting point, find the shortest path to a target point by using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.\n\nSolution to Problem 1:\nTo find all possible paths from the starting point to the target point, we can use a recursive algorithm. Starting from the starting point, we explore all its neighbors and recursively explore their neighbors until we reach the target point. We keep track of all visited nodes to avoid looping.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nTo find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point using Dijkstra's algorithm, we initialize all nodes with a distance of infinity except for the starting point, which is set to 0. We create a priority queue and insert the starting point with its distance. While the priority queue is not empty, we extract the node with the minimum distance and update the distances of its neighbors. We repeat this process until we extract the target point from the priority queue. Finally, we reconstruct the shortest path from the target point using the previous node information.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nTo find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point using BFS algorithm, we initialize a queue and insert the starting point. We also keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them. We dequeue a node from the queue, explore its neighbors, and enqueue them if they have not been visited before. We also keep track of the previous node to construct the shortest path later. We repeat this process until we dequeue the target point from the queue.
