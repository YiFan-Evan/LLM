Start by initializing a queue and a visited set. Put the start node in the queue and mark it as visited.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the queue.\n3. For each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited, mark it as visited, enqueue it, and keep track of the path from the start node to that neighbor.\n4. When the destination node is reached, reconstruct the path from the start node to the destination node.\n\n**Problem 2**: Find the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n\n**Description**: Given a weighted graph as an adjacency list and two nodes (start and destination), we need to find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node using Dijkstra's Algorithm.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Initialize a priority queue (min heap) and a distances dictionary to keep track of the shortest distance from the start node to each node.\n2. Initially, set the distance to all nodes as infinity, except the start node which is 0.\n3. Repeat the following until the priority queue is empty:\n   - Pop a node from the priority queue.\n   - Update the distance to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\n4.

Initialize an open list (priority queue based on the heuristic values) and a costs dictionary to keep track of the cost from the start node to each node.\n2. Initially, set the cost to all nodes as infinity, except the start node which is 0.\n3. Repeat the following until the open list is empty:\n   - Select a node from the open list with the lowest cost.\n   - Update the cost to its neighbors if a shorter path is found, considering the heuristic value.\n4.
