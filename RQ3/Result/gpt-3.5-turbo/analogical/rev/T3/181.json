Problem: Find the shortest path from node 1 to node 5 in the given graph.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. We start from the start node and visit all the adjacent nodes. We keep track of the distance from the start node to each visited node. Once we reach the target node, we can trace back the path from the target node to the start node using the distance information.\n\n2.
