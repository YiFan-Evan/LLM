Use Breadth-First Search algorithm to solve the problem.\n\nSolution to Problem 1 (Shortest Path in a Graph):\nTo find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. We start at the starting point and explore all its neighboring nodes level by level until we reach the target point. We keep track of the visited nodes and the parent of each visited node to construct the shortest path.\n\nSolution to Problem 2 (Dijkstra's Algorithm):\nTo find the shortest path in a weighted graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. We start at the starting point and maintain a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the nodes with the minimum distance from the starting point. We repeatedly select the node with the minimum distance, update the distances of its neighboring nodes, and update the parent of each neighbor accordingly. This process continues until we reach the target point.\n\nSolution to Problem 3 (Breadth-First Search):\nTo find the shortest path in an unweighted graph, we can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.

We start at the starting node and recursively explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS does not guarantee the shortest path, but it can be used to find any path between two points.\n\nSolution to Problem 3 (Floyd-Warshall Algorithm):\nTo find the shortest path in a weighted graph, we can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
