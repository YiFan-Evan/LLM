We start by initializing a queue and adding the starting point to the queue. We also initialize a visited array to keep track of visited nodes. While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node, mark it as visited, and check if it is the target point. If it is, we have found the shortest path. If not, we enqueue all its adjacent nodes that have not been visited yet. We continue this process until we find the target point or traverse all reachable nodes.\n\nSolution 2:\nTo determine if there exists a path from the starting point to the target point, we can modify the BFS algorithm from solution 1. Instead of stopping when we find the target point, we continue the BFS until we traverse all reachable nodes from the starting point. If at any point we visit the target point, we know there exists a path.\n\nSolution 3:\nTo find the length of the shortest path from the starting point to the target point, we can use the BFS algorithm from solution 1. Instead of stopping when we find the target point, we keep track of the level of each node. We initialize the level of the starting point as 0 and increment the level for each adjacent node as we traverse the graph.
