Starting from node 0, we explore its neighboring nodes and add them to the queue. We continue this process until we reach node 6 or we have visited all the nodes. We also keep track of the parent node for each node visited, which allows us to backtrack and find the shortest path.\n\nProblem 2:\nDescription: Find the shortest path from node 3 to node 5.\nSolution: Similar to problem 1, we can use the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 5. Starting from node 3, we explore its neighboring nodes and add them to the queue. We continue this process until we reach node 5 or we have visited all the nodes.
