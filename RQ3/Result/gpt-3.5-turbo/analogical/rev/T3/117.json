Starting from the source node, we enqueue its neighbors in a queue and continue the process until we find the target node or the queue becomes empty. We use a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each visited node, which allows us to reconstruct the shortest path from the target node back to the source node.\n\nProblem 2: Finding the shortest path between two nodes in a weighted graph\n\nGiven a weighted graph represented by an array of nodes, an array of edges, and each edge associated with a positive weight, find the shortest path between a starting node and a target node. \n\nSolution: We can solve this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm. Starting from the source node, we initialize the distance to all other nodes as infinity except for the source node, which we set to 0. We use a priority queue to select the node with the minimum distance, update the distances of its neighbors, and continue the process until we reach the target node or the priority queue becomes empty. We use a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each visited node, allowing us to reconstruct the shortest path from the target node back to the source node.\n\nProblem 3: Finding the shortest path between two nodes in a graph with negative weights\n\nGiven a graph represented by an array of nodes, an array of edges, and each edge associated with a weight (positive, negative, or zero), find the shortest path between a starting node and a target node. \n\nSolution: We can solve this problem using the Bellman-Ford algorithm. Starting from the source node, we initialize the distance to all other nodes as infinity except for the source node, which we set to 0. We relax all edges repeatedly until we can no longer update the distances. If there is a negative cycle in the graph, the algorithm will detect it. We use a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each visited node, allowing us to reconstruct the shortest path from the target node back to the source node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->0->1->8"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 4], [1, 4], [1, 9], [1, 8], [2, 10], [2, 7], [3, 6], [3, 10], [5, 11], [7, 12], [8, 11], [8, 12]]} The start node: 4 The destination: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Finding the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph\n\nGiven an unweighted graph represented by an array of nodes and an array of edges, find the shortest path between a starting node and a target node. \n\nSolution: We can solve this problem using Breadth First Search (BFS).

In this case, when visiting a neighbor node, we check if it is an obstacle and skip it. We continue the BFS process until we find the target node or all reachable nodes have been visited. We use a dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each visited node, allowing us to reconstruct the shortest path from the target node back to the source node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->0->1"}]
