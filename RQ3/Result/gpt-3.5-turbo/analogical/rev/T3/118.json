Continue this process until the destination node is found.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nDescription: Given a graph represented as nodes and edges, find the shortest path from a specified starting node to a destination node using Dijkstra's algorithm.\nSolution: Initialize distances to all nodes as infinity except the starting node which is 0. Update the distance values by selecting the node with the smallest distance, then update the distances of its neighbors.
