Let u = sin(x), then du = cos(x) dx. \n\nRewriting the integral in terms of u, we have:\n\n\u222b (x*(1+x)/sin(x)) dx = \u222b (x*(1+x)/u) (1/cos(x)) du\n                       = \u222b (x*(1+x))/(u*cos(x)) du\n\nNow, we can express x and cos(x) in terms of u using the trigonometric identity sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1:\n\nx = \u221a(1 - u^2)\ncos(x) = \u221a(1 - sin^2(x)) = \u221a(1 - u^2)\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the integral, we have:\n\n\u222b ((\u221a(1 - u^2))*(1+(\u221a(1 - u^2))))/(u*\u221a(1 - u^2)) du\n\nSimplifying this expression, we can further solve the integral.\n\nProblem 3:\nConsider the indefinite integral of the function: x*(1+x)/sin(x).\n\nSolution 3:\nWe can also use the method of partial fractions to solve this integral. First, we factorize the denominator:\n\nsin(x) = (x*cos(x)) / cos(x) + sin(x)\n        = (x*cos(x)) / [sin(x)/cos(x) + sin(x)]\n\nNow, we can write the function as a sum of two fractions:\n\nx*(1+x)/sin(x) = A*(sin(x)/cos(x)) + B*sin(x)\n\nNext, we cross-multiply and equate coefficients to find the values of A and B.
