Integrating the last term gives: -cos(x)*(1+x) + sin(x) + C.\n\nProblem 2: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x)*(1+x).\nSolution 2: Another approach is to expand the expression using the product rule and then integrate the individual terms to get the result. The integral of sin(x)*(1+x)dx expands to integrate sin(x)dx + x*sin(x)dx. After integrating each term, you get -cos(x) + x*sin(x) + C.\n\nProblem 3: Calculate the indefinite integral of sin(x)*(1+x).\nSolution 3: An alternative method is to use a trigonometric identity to simplify the integral. You can rewrite sin(x)*(1+x) as sin(x) + x*sin(x) and then integrate each term separately. The integral becomes -cos(x) - x*cos(x) + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -cos(4)*(1+4) + sin(4) = -cos(4)*5 + sin(4) \u2248 -4.36."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sin(x)*(1+x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Calculate the indefinite integral of 5*(sin(x)*(1+x)).\nSolution 1: To find the indefinite integral, you can apply the constant multiple rule where you can factor out the constant 5. The integral of 5*(sin(x)*(1+x))dx simplifies to 5 times the integral of sin(x)*(1+x)dx, which we already solved in the previous scenario.

After expanding the expression 5*(sin(x)*(1+x)), you get the integral of 5*sin(x)dx + 5*x*sin(x)dx. Integrating each term individually results in -5*cos(x) + 5*x*sin(x) + C.\n\nProblem 3: Calculate the indefinite integral of 5*(sin(x)*(1+x)).\nSolution 3: You can also rewrite the expression as 5*(sin(x) + x*sin(x)), then integrate each part separately.
