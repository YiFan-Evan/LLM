We can rewrite x/e^x as xe^(-x), and use a substitution method. Let u = -x. Then, du = -dx.

Expand x/e^x as x * e^(-x), and make the substitution u = x and v = e^(-x). Using the quotient rule, the integral becomes:\n\u222bx/e^x dx = x * (-e^(-x)) - \u222b1 * (-e^(-x)) dx\n= -xe^(-x) + e^(-x) + C\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(x/e^x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Find the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = 5*(x/e^x).\nSolution: We can apply a similar approach as before.
