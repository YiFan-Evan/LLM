Problem: Calculate the indefinite integral of cos(x)^2 dx.\n   \n   Description: We can use the power-reduction formula for cosine to simplify the integral of cos(x)^2. The power-reduction formula states that cos^2(x) = (1 + cos(2x))/2. Applying this formula to the integral of cos(x)^2, we get:\n\n   \u222bcos(x)^2 dx = \u222b(1 + cos(2x))/2 dx\n                = \u222b1/2 dx + \u222bcos(2x)/2 dx\n                = 1/2x + 1/4sin(2x) + C\n\n2.
