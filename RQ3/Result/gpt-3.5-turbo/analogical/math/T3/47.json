Therefore, the integral of e^x * ln(x) + x dx is x + x^2/2 + C.\n\nProblem 2: Find the indefinite integral of e^x * ln(x) + x dx.\nSolution 2: Split the integral into two parts, \u222be^x * ln(x) dx and \u222bx dx. The first part has been solved in a previous problem. The integral of x is (1/2)x^2. Combining the two results, the integral is x + x^2/2 + C.\n\nProblem 3: Find the indefinite integral of e^x * ln(x) + x dx.\nSolution 3: We will integrate this function by parts. Let u = ln(x) and dv = e^x dx for the first term. Then, we have du = 1/x dx and v = e^x. Applying the integration by parts formula, we get e^x * ln(x) - \u222b(e^x * 1/x) dx which simplifies to e^x * ln(x) - e^x. Integrating x with respect to x gives (1/2)x^2.
