To find the indefinite integral, we can use integration by parts. Let u = ln(x)^2 and dv = dx. Then, du = 2ln(x) * 1/x dx and v = x. Apply the integration by parts formula: \u222budv = uv - \u222bvdu. So, the integral of x*ln(x)^2 with respect to x is x*ln(x)^2 - \u222b2ln(x) dx. Integrating 2ln(x) dx gives us 2xln(x) - 2x.
