Compute the indefinite integral of f(x).\n**Solution:**\nLet u = 1+cos(x), then du = -sin(x)dx. Therefore, the integral becomes \u222bu^2du = (u^3)/3 + C = ((1+cos(x))^3)/3 + C.\n\n**Problem 2:**\nFind the indefinite integral of the function g(x) = (1+cos(x))^2.\n**Solution:**\nUsing the formula for the expansion of (a+b)^2, we have g(x) = (1+2cos(x)+cos^2(x)). Simplifying this expression further, we get g(x) = 1 + 2cos(x) + cos^2(x). Now, \u222bg(x)dx = \u222b(1 + 2cos(x) + cos^2(x))dx = x + 2sin(x) + (sin(2x) / 2) + C.\n\n**Problem 3:**\nGiven h(x) = (1+cos(x))^2, determine its indefinite integral.\n**Solution:**\nUsing the property (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, h(x) = 1 + 2cos(x) + cos^2(x). The integral of h(x) will be \u222b(1 + 2cos(x) + cos^2(x))dx = x + 2sin(x) + (sin(2x) / 2) + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:  ((1+cos(4))^3)/3.
