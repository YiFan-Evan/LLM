First, let's find the integral of \\( \\frac{\\cos(x)}{x} \\) separately. Unfortunately, there is no elementary function to represent this integral, so we cannot find its exact value. For the second part of the integral, we can integrate \\( x \\) as follows: \\( \\frac{x^2}{2} \\).

Again, the first part of the integral does not have an elementary function, so we cannot solve it exactly. The second part is the integral of \\( x \\), which is \\( \\frac{x^2}{2} \\). Hence, the indefinite integral is \\( \\int \\left(\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x} + x\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C \\).\n\nProblem 3: Calculate the indefinite integral of the function \\( \\int \\left(\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x} + x\\right) \\, dx \\).\nSolution: Using the linearity of the integral, we can separate the integral into two parts: \\( \\int \\frac{\\cos(x)}{x} \\, dx \\) and \\( \\int x \\, dx \\). The first part does not have an elementary function, while the second part integrates to \\( \\frac{x^2}{2} \\). Thus, we have \\( \\int \\left(\\frac{\\cos(x)}{x} + x\\right) \\, dx = \\frac{x^2}{2} + C \\).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \\( \\frac{16}{2} = 8 \\)."}]
