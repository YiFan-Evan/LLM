Let u = cos(x) and dv = (1+x)dx. Calculating the derivatives and integrals, we get du = -sin(x)dx and v = x + 0.5x^2. Now, we can use the formula \u222budv = uv - \u222bvdu to find the integral.\n\nSolution 1: Applying integration by parts, we get:\n\u222bcos(x)*(1+x)dx = cos(x)*x + 0.5*cos(x)*x^2 - \u222b(-sin(x))*(x + 0.5x^2)dx\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\u222bcos(x)*(1+x)dx = x*cos(x) + 0.5*x^2*cos(x) + \u222bsin(x)*(x + 0.5x^2)dx\nTherefore, the indefinite integral is: x*cos(x) + 0.5*x^2*cos(x) + sin(x)*(x - 0.5x^2).\n\nProblem 2: Find the value of the indefinite integral of cos(x)*(1+x) at x=4.\n\nDescription 2: After finding the indefinite integral in the previous step, we substitute the value of x with 4 to find the result of the integral.\n\nSolution 2: Substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral expression, we get:\n4*cos(4) + 0.5*4^2*cos(4) + sin(4)*(4 - 0.5*4^2)\nCalculating the above expression gives us the value of the integral at x=4.\n\nProblem 3: Determine the integer result of the expression obtained by substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral of cos(x)*(1+x), rounding down.\n\nDescription 3: By evaluating the expression obtained from substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral and rounding down, we find the final integer result of the problem.\n\nSolution 3: The expression after substitution is: 4*cos(4) + 0.5*4^2*cos(4) + sin(4)*(4 - 0.5*4^2).
