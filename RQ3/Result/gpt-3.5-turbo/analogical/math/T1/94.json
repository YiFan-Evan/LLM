The integral does not have a closed form solution using familiar functions. Therefore, the final answer is: The integral does not have a solution in terms of elementary functions.\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nFind the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^(x^2) dx by using substitution.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet u = x^2, du = 2x dx.\n\n\u222be^(x^2) dx = \u222be^u (1/2x du) = (1/2) \u222be^u du.\n\nThe integral \u222be^u du can be expressed as \u221a\u03c0 * erf(u) / 2 + C, where erf(u) is the error function.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of f(x) = e^(x^2) dx is (\u221a\u03c0/2) * erf(x^2) + C.\n\n**Problem 3:**\n\nCalculate the indefinite integral of the function f(x) = e^(x^2) dx by using a different substitution.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet u = \u221a(x^2), du = (x/\u221a(x^2)) dx = (x/|x|) dx.\n\nNow we can split the integral into two cases:\n\nFor x > 0, we have u = x, du = dx, and the integral becomes:\n\u222b e^(x^2) dx = \u222b e^u du = e^u + C = e^(x^2) + C.\n\nFor x < 0, we have u = -x, du = -dx, and the integral becomes:\n\u222b e^(x^2) dx = \u222b e^((-x)^2) (-dx) = -\u222b e^(x^2) dx.\n\nAdding these two cases together:\n\u222b e^(x^2) dx = \u222b e^(x^2) dx + -\u222b e^(x^2) dx = 2\u222b e^(x^2) dx.\n\nTherefore, \u222b e^(x^2) dx = (1/2) \u222b e^(x^2) dx.\n\nUsing the result from Problem 2, we know that \u222b e^(x^2) dx = (\u221a\u03c0/2) * erf(x^2) + C.\n\nSubstituting this back, we have:\n(1/2) \u222b e^(x^2) dx = (1/2) * [ (\u221a\u03c0/2) * erf(x^2) + C ] = (\u221a\u03c0/4) * erf(x^2) + C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (\u221a\u03c0/4) * erf(16) + C."}]
