This integral does not have a standard antiderivative, so the integral e^(x^2) cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions.\n\n**Problem 2**: Calculate the indefinite integral of e^(x^2) using integration by parts.\n\n**Solution**: Let u = e^(x^2) and dv = dx. Then du = 2xe^(x^2)dx and v = x. Applying integration by parts, we get \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du. After evaluating, we get x * e^(x^2) - \u222b2x^2e^(x^2) dx.

By applying integration by parts, the integral becomes x * e^(x^2) - \u222b2x^2 e^(x^2) dx. The new integral is still not an elementary function.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: 0.**"}]
