We know that the integral of sec(x) is ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|.

The integral of sec(x) is ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|. Hence, the indefinite integral of x^2*(1/x)/cos(x) is 0.5*x^2*ln|x| + C.\n\nProblem 3: Find the indefinite integral of (2/x)*((1/x)/cos(x)).\nSolution 3: Simplifying the expression gives us (2/x) * sec(x). The integral of sec(x) is ln|sec(x) + tan(x)|.

The integral of (1/x)/cos(x) remains ln|x|, and the integral of x^2 is (1/3)x^3. Therefore, the indefinite integral of (1/x)/cos(x) - x^2 is ln|x| - (1/3)x^3 + C.\n\nProblem 3: Find the indefinite integral of 2*(1/x)/cos(x).\nSolution 3: When we multiply the function by 2, the integral becomes 2*ln|x| + C since the integral of (1/x)/cos(x) is ln|x|.
