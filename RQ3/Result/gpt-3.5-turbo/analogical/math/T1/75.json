Let u = cos(x) and dv = dx/x. Then, du = -sin(x)dx and v = ln(|x|). Applying the integration by parts formula \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, we get:\n\u222bcos(x)/x dx = cos(x) ln(|x|) - \u222b-sin(x) ln(|x|)dx\nSolving the integral on the right side, we can get the indefinite integral of cos(x)/x.\n\nProblem 2: Find the indefinite integral of (cos(x))^2/x.\nSolution 2: The integral of (cos(x))^2/x is not a straightforward integral. To solve it, we can use the trigonometric identity cos(2x) = 2(cos(x))^2 - 1 to express (cos(x))^2 in terms of cos(2x). Then we can rewrite the integral in a form where we can apply a substitution to simplify the integration process.\n\nProblem 3: Find the indefinite integral of cos(x)/x^2.\nSolution 3: To find the indefinite integral of cos(x)/x^2, we can write it as cos(x)*x^(-2) and use the power rule for integration. The integral of x^(-n) dx is x^(-n+1)/(n-1) for n\u22601. So, we can apply this rule to compute the integral of cos(x)/x^2.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -0.1987"}, {"role": "user", "content": "cos(x)/x"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Find the indefinite integral of cos(x)/x.\nSolution 1: The integral of cos(x)/x is a known integral that does not have an elementary antiderivative in terms of elementary functions.
