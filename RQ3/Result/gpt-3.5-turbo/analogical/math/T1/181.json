Substituting into the integral, we get:\n\n$$\\int e^{x^2} dx = \\int e^u du = \\int e^u du = e^u + C = e^x + C$$\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of $e^{x^2}$ is $e^x + C$.\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\nFind the indefinite integral of the function $e^{x^2}$ using substitution.\n\n**Solution 2:**\n\nLet $u = x^2$, then $du = 2x dx$. Thus, $x dx = \\frac{1}{2} du$. Substituting into the integral gives:\n\n$$\\int e^{x^2} dx = \\int e^u \\frac{1}{2} du = \\frac{1}{2} \\int e^u du = \\frac{1}{2} e^u + C = \\frac{1}{2} e^{x^2} + C$$\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of $e^{x^2}$ is $\\frac{1}{2} e^{x^2} + C$.\n\n**Problem 3:**\n\nIf $F(x) = \\int e^{x^2} dx$, find $F'(x)$.\n\n**Solution 3:**\n\nBy the second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, since $F(x) = \\int e^{x^2} dx$ is an indefinite integral of $e^{x^2}$, then $F'(x) = e^{x^2}$.\n\nTherefore, the derivative of $F(x)$ is $e^{x^2}$.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is: 54.**\n\n(Note: Calculating $e^{4^2}$ results in approximately $54.598$.
