The derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x) and the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x). Thus, the derivative of sin(sinh(x)) is cos(sinh(x)) * cosh(x). \n\nNow, to find the indefinite integral, we reverse the process. We need to find the antiderivative of cos(sinh(x)) * cosh(x). This integral does not have a simple closed-form solution.\n\nProblem 2:\nFind the value of the indefinite integral when x = 4.\n\nSolution 2:\nUnfortunately, since the indefinite integral of sin(sinh(x)) does not have a simple closed-form solution, we cannot directly substitute x = 4 into the antiderivative expression. \n\nProblem 3:\nProvide the integer result of the expression obtained by substituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral.\n\nSolution 3:\nSince we are unable to find the exact value of the indefinite integral at x = 4, we cannot provide an integer result for this problem.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: N/A"}, {"role": "user", "content": "sin(sinh(x))"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1:\nCalculate the indefinite integral of sin(sinh(x)) with respect to x.\n\nSolution 1:\nTo find the indefinite integral of sin(sinh(x)), we first notice that the derivative of sinh(x) is cosh(x). So the integral of sin(sinh(x)) with respect to x can be found by substitution. Let u = sinh(x), then du = cosh(x)dx. This means the integral becomes \u222b sin(u) du. The integral of sin(u) is -cos(u) + C, where C is the constant of integration. Substituting back u = sinh(x) gives the result as -cos(sinh(x)) + C.\n\nProblem 2:\nFind the value of the indefinite integral when x = 4.\n\nSolution 2:\nSubstitute x = 4 into the result of the indefinite integral -cos(sinh(x)) + C. Evaluate -cos(sinh(4)) to find the value of the integral at x = 4.\n\nProblem 3:\nProvide the integer result of the expression obtained by substituting x = 4 into the indefinite integral.\n\nSolution 3:\nSubstitute x = 4 into -cos(sinh(x)) to get -cos(sinh(4)). Evaluating this expression, we find -cos(sinh(4)) \u2248 -0.659. Rounding this down gives us the integer result as -1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -1"}]
