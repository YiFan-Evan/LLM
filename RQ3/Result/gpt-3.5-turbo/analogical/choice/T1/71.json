Venus has an average surface temperature of about 467 degrees Celsius, while Mercury's average surface temperature is around 167 degrees Celsius. Therefore, the surface of Venus is hotter than the surface of Mercury.\n\nSolution to Problem 2: The planet Mercury has a very thin atmosphere. Its atmosphere consists mainly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. There is very little atmosphere to retain heat, contributing to its extreme temperature variations. Therefore, Mercury has a thin atmosphere.\n\nSolution to Problem 3: Mercury does not have any moons. It is one of the two planets in our solar system that is moonless, with Venus being the other. Therefore, the planet Mercury does not have any moons.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. uninhabitable"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The planet Mercury is unsuitable for human life or what?\nOptions: E. jupiter D. poisonous C. mercury sulphide B. uninhabitable A. toxic"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Is the surface of the planet Mercury made up of metal?\nProblem 2: Does the planet Mercury have extreme temperature variations?\nProblem 3: Is the planet Mercury the closest planet to the Sun?\n\nSolution to Problem 1: Yes, the surface of the planet Mercury is mostly composed of rock and metal. It has a high metal content, with minerals such as iron and nickel present on its surface. Therefore, the surface of the planet Mercury is made up of metal.\n\nSolution to Problem 2: The planet Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations due to its lack of atmosphere to retain heat. Temperatures on the planet can reach up to around 427 degrees Celsius on the side facing the Sun and drop to around -173 degrees Celsius on the side facing away from the Sun. Therefore, the planet Mercury does have extreme temperature variations.\n\nSolution to Problem 3: Yes, the planet Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun in our solar system. It orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 36 million miles. Therefore, the planet Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. toxic"}]
