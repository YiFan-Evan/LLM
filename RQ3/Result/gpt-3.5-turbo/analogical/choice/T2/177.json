The police suspect a woman who was seen with him last. She claims she killed him because he was trying to rape her. Was her action justified?\n\nSolution 1: In cases of self-defense, killing someone may be justified if it is the only way to prevent harm or protect oneself. The woman's action may be considered justified if she can provide evidence that she was indeed defending herself from being raped.\n\nProblem 2: A woman is arrested for killing a stranger she met in a dark alley. During interrogation, she reveals that the man had previously assaulted and raped her, and she decided to seek revenge. Is her action justified?\n\nSolution 2: Seeking revenge by killing someone is not justified under the law. The woman could have reported the previous assault to the authorities and sought help through legal means.

Was her action justified?\n\nSolution 3: Killing someone to prevent the disclosure of a passcode, without any immediate threat to life or safety, is not a justified action. There are legal and ethical ways to protect confidential information without resorting to violence.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. get revenge"}]
