Where was this common sight?\n\nSolution 1: The term \"stumblebum\" typically refers to a clumsy or incompetent person and is not associated with a specific location where bums asking for change or a ticket would be commonly seen. Therefore, this scenario does not align with any familiar setting, making the mention of \"stumblebum\" in this context unusual.\n\nProblem 2: There was more than one bum asking for change or a ticket; it was the cheapest way to travel, so it was no surprise sight at the bridge. Where was this common sight?\n\nSolution 2: Bridges are not typically a common place where one would expect to see bums asking for change or a ticket as a means of cheap travel. While some homeless individuals may seek refuge or shelter under bridges, it is not a location associated with transportation.\n\nProblem 3: There was more than one bum asking for change or a ticket; it was the cheapest way to travel, so it was no surprise sight at the bus depot. Where was this common sight?\n\nSolution 3: Bums asking for change or a ticket due to it being the cheapest way to travel might be commonly seen at a bus depot since buses are generally an affordable mode of transportation, attracting individuals of various financial backgrounds. Therefore, it is plausible to encounter such a scene at a bus depot.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. bus depot."}]
