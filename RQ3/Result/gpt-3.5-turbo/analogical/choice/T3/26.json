It is important for drivers to adhere to traffic laws, pay attention to the road, and practice defensive driving to reduce the risk of accidents.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nBackache while driving can be caused by poor posture, an uncomfortable seat, lack of lumbar support, prolonged sitting in the same position, and inadequate adjustment of the seat and steering wheel. To prevent backache, drivers should adjust their seat to maintain proper posture, take regular breaks to stretch and walk around, use a cushion or lumbar support if needed, and consider exercises to strengthen the back muscles.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nFactors contributing to pollution from vehicles include emissions from internal combustion engines, burning of fossil fuels (such as gasoline and diesel), vehicle exhaust containing harmful pollutants like carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter, as well as inefficient fuel consumption. To reduce pollution, it is important to maintain vehicles properly, use public transportation or carpool when possible, drive fuel-efficient vehicles, and advocate for cleaner fuel technologies.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. automobile accidents"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What could prevent a driving car from continuing to drive?
