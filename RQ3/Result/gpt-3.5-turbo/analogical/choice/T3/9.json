This is because if an object is falling toward the ground, you would be positioned above the object to see it fall.\nProblem 2: When you see something set, you are where in relation to it?\nSolution 2: When you see something set, you are facing towards the object. In astronomy, when a celestial object \"sets,\" it appears to move below the horizon as the Earth rotates, meaning you are facing towards it as it sets.\nProblem 3: When you see something lower, you are where in relation to it?\nSolution 3: When you see something lower, you are positioned higher than the object. This is because when something is lower in your line of sight, it means it is located below your eye level, requiring you to be positioned higher to look down on it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. near."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: When you see something rise, you are where in relation to it?
