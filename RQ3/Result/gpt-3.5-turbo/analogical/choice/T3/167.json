What type of engine is typically used to power this aircraft?\nOptions: A. jet engine B. helicopter C. electric motor D. steam engine E. internal combustion engine\nSolution: In this case, the typical engine used to power the Boeing 747 is a jet engine, making option A the correct choice.\n\nProblem 2: Sarah inspected the motor of the Tesla Model S. What type of power source does this electric car utilize?\nOptions: A. jet engine B. helicopter C. electric motor D. steam engine E. internal combustion engine\nSolution: The Tesla Model S is powered by an electric motor, making option C the correct choice.\n\nProblem 3: Tom investigated the source of energy for the International Space Station's solar panels. What type of power source do these panels rely on?\nOptions: A. jet engine B. solar power C. electric motor D. nuclear reactor E. wind turbine\nSolution: The solar panels on the International Space Station rely on solar power, making option B the correct choice.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. jet engine"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: George checked the rotor of the Apache, which wasn't powered by internal combustion, but by what? (Since the reason-words \"flame_photometry, main_shock, propterygial, slinky, internal\" do not relate to any of the potential choices except for \"electric motor\", the model predicts that George checked the rotor of the Apache which wasn't powered by internal combustion, but by an electric motor.)\nOptions: A. jet engine B. helicopter C. electric motor D. rotator E. electrical circuit"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Problem 1: Emily examined the engine of a commercial airplane and noticed it was powered by rotating blades to generate lift. What type of engine is commonly used in commercial airplanes?\nOptions: A. jet engine B. helicopter C. electric motor D. turboprop E. internal combustion engine\nSolution: In commercial airplanes, a type of engine commonly used is a turboprop engine, making option D the correct choice.\n\nProblem 2: John observed a small drone flying overhead and wondered about its power source. What type of motor is typically found in drones for propulsion?\nOptions: A. jet engine B. helicopter C. electric motor D. gas engine E. internal combustion engine\nSolution: Drones are typically powered by electric motors for propulsion, making option C the correct choice.\n\nProblem 3: Lily investigated the power source for a wind turbine on a wind farm.
