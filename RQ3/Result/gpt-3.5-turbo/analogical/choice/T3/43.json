(Since the person is blind and paralyzed, they cannot physically go somewhere or see their favorite show. Additionally, their ability to hear news or analyze may be limited due to their physical condition. However, despite these limitations, the person can still satisfy their curiosity by examining things. Ignorance about certain objects could lead to a desire to learn more through examination. The person's physical limitations may also make them more interested in what they can sense with touch, leading them to examine objects more closely. Additionally, since the person may have limited interactions with others, examining objects can serve as a way to meet interesting people through discussing those objects. The words \"can\" and \"humans_after_certain_time\" may suggest that despite physical limitations, the person is still capable of curiosity and a desire to learn. The word \"dead_against\" may suggest that this curiosity is in opposition to the person's physical limitations, but they still have the ability to explore through examination.)\nOptions: A. hear news B. analyse C. go somewhere D. examine thing E. see favorite show"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Therefore, the final answer is: D. examine thing"}]
