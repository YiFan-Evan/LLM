However, the lack of a substantial atmosphere makes breathing impossible on the planet.\n\nSolution to Problem 2: Humans cannot survive on the surface of Mercury without any protective gear due to extreme temperature variations, ranging from -173\u00b0C (-280\u00b0F) at night to 427\u00b0C (800\u00b0F) during the day. Additionally, the lack of atmosphere means there is no protection from the Sun's radiation.\n\nSolution to Problem 3: Mercury does not have the necessary conditions to support human life as the planet lacks a breathable atmosphere, suitable temperatures, and protection from radiation. Therefore, it is considered unsuitable for human habitation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. uninhabitable"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The planet Mercury is unsuitable for human life or what?
