The only difference would be that it could not maintain air pressure properly.\n\nSolution to Problem 2: If a basketball had a hole in it and lost its general shape, it would no longer be round or able to maintain its original size and structure.\n\nSolution to Problem 3: If a basketball did not have a hole in it but lost its general shape, it would not be round and would likely appear deflated or misshapen.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. gone."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What would not be true about a basketball if it had a hole in it but it did not lose its general shape?
