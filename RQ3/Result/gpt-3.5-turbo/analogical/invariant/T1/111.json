Problem: Write a loop invariant for a loop that finds the maximum element in an array.\n\nDescription: Given an array `arr` of integers, write a loop that iterates through the array to find the maximum element in the array. \n\nSolution: The loop invariant for this problem can be written as `max_value = max(arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[l-1])`.\n\n2. Problem: Write a loop invariant for a loop that checks if an array is sorted.\n\nDescription: Given an array `arr` of integers, write a loop that iterates through the array to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nSolution: The loop invariant for this problem can be written as `is_sorted = arr[0] <= arr[1] <= ... <= arr[l-1]`.\n\n3. Problem: Write a loop invariant for a loop that calculates the sum of squared elements in an array.\n\nDescription: Given an array `arr` of integers, write a loop that calculates the sum of squared elements in the array.\n\nSolution: The loop invariant for this problem can be written as `sum_of_squares = arr[0]^2 + arr[1]^2 + ... + arr[l-1]^2`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `member_value = arr[id]`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    l = 0\n    while l <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if l == id:\n            member_value = arr[l]\n        l += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.
