Problem: Write a Python program that finds the average value of elements in an array.\n   Solution: Initialize variables to store the sum of elements and the count of elements. Iterate through the array, summing up elements and counting them. Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the count.\n   \n3. Problem: Write a Python program that checks if all elements in an array are positive.\n   Solution: Initialize a flag variable to indicate if all elements are positive.
