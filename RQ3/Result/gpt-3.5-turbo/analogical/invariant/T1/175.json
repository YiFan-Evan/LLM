Repeat this process until the array is sorted in ascending order.\n   \n2. **Problem 2:**\n   **Description:** Write a Python program that finds the maximum value in an array using the selection sort algorithm.\n   **Solution:** Implement the selection sort algorithm by finding the maximum value in the unsorted part of the array and swapping it with the last element of the sorted part. Repeat this process until the array is sorted in descending order.\n   \n3. **Problem 3:**\n   **Description:** Write a Python program that calculates the factorial of a given number using the iterative loop approach.\n   **Solution:** Initialize a variable to store the factorial value as 1. Use a loop to iterate from 1 to the given number and multiply the current value of the factorial variable with the loop variable. Return the final factorial value after completing the loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'arr[z] > arr[z - 1] = False'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = 0\n    while p <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        p += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **Problem 1:**\n   **Description:** Write a Python program that sorts an array in descending order using the insertion sort algorithm.\n   **Solution:** Implement the insertion sort algorithm by inserting each element of the array into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.
