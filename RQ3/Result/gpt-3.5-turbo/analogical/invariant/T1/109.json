[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: Write a loop invariant for a program that iterates over an array to find the maximum value.\n\nDescription: Given an array, the program iterates through the array elements to identify the maximum value. \n\nSolution:\nLoop invariant: 'max_value = max(arr[0:j])'\n\n2. Problem: Write a loop invariant for a program that calculates the sum of all positive values in an array.\n\nDescription: The program loops through the array to find and sum all positive values.\n\nSolution:\nLoop invariant: 'sum_positive = sum(arr[0:j] where arr[j] > 0)'\n\n3. Problem: Write a loop invariant for a program that checks if all elements in an array are unique.\n\nDescription: The program iterates through the array elements to verify if all values are unique.\n\nSolution:\nLoop invariant: 'all_unique = all(arr[0:j] != arr[j] for each arr[j] in arr)'\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'member_value = arr[0:id] or -1 if id not in range(len(arr))'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    j = 0\n    while j <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if j == id:\n            member_value = arr[j]\n        j += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.
