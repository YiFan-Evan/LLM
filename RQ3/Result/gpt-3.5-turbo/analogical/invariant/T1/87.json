[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

In each subsequent iteration, the `last_value` is updated with the value of the current element `arr[h]`. At the end of the loop, `last_value` will contain the value of the last element in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `last_value = arr[len(arr)-1]`.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nIn the first iteration of the loop, the `last_value` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`. In each subsequent iteration, the `last_value` is updated with the value of the current element `arr[h]`. At the end of the loop, `last_value` will contain the value of the last element in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `last_value = arr[h-1]`.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nIn the first iteration of the loop, the `last_value` is assigned the value of `arr[0]`. In each subsequent iteration, the `last_value` is updated with the value of the current element `arr[h]`.

After the loop completes, `last_value` will still have the value of the first element in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `last_value = arr[0]`.\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nAt each iteration of the loop, the variable `h` is incremented and `last_value` is updated to the current element `arr[h]`. Since the loop condition is `h <= len(arr) - 1`, the loop terminates after all elements in the array are processed. Therefore, `last_value` will contain the maximum value in the array after the loop completes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `last_value = max(arr)`.\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nDuring each iteration, the current element `arr[h]` is added to `last_value`. By the end of the loop (when `h = len(arr)`), `last_value` will contain the sum of all elements in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `last_value = sum(arr)`.\n\nFinally, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is: `last_value = arr[h]`."}]
