Problem: Write a Python function that returns the index of a specific element in an array. The function should take an array and a target value as input and return the index of the target value in the array if it exists, otherwise return -1.\n\nSolution:\n```python\ndef find_index(arr, target):\n    index_value = -1\n    n = 0\n    while n < len(arr):\n        if arr[n] == target:\n            index_value = n\n            break\n        n += 1\n    return index_value\n```\n\n2.
