[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Iterate through the array, updating `max_value` if a larger value is encountered.\n\n2. **Problem 2:**\nDescription: Write a function to count the number of occurrences of a specific element in an array.\nSolution: Keep track of the count of occurrences of the element in a variable `count`. Traverse the array, incrementing `count` whenever the element is encountered.\n\n3. **Problem 3:**\nDescription: Write a function to check if all elements in an array are positive.\nSolution: Set a boolean variable `all_positive` to `True` initially. Iterate through the array, updating `all_positive` to `False` if any element is found to be non-positive.\n\n**Answer:**\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'min_value = min(arr[0], ..., arr[n-1])'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    n = 0\n    while n <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[n] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[n]\n        n += 1\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **Problem 1:**\nDescription: Write a function to find the sum of all elements in an array of integers.\nSolution: Maintain a variable `sum` initialized to 0.
