[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: \nDescription: Find the sum of all positive integers in an array.\nSolution: Initialize a variable sum_value to 0. Iterate through the array and add each positive element to sum_value. Return sum_value.\n\n3. Problem: \nDescription: Check if a given element exists in an array.\nSolution: Initialize a variable found_value to False.
