[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: \nProgram that finds the maximum element in an array.\nDescription: The program contains a loop that iterates over the array and updates a variable to store the maximum element found so far. \nSolution: While iterating through the array, we update the loop invariant to be 'max_value = max(arr[0]...arr[s-1])'.\n\n2. Problem:\nProgram that calculates the sum of all elements in an array.\nDescription: The program contains a loop that iterates over the array and accumulates the sum of elements found so far. \nSolution: While iterating through the array, we update the loop invariant to be 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]...arr[s-1])'.\n\n3.
