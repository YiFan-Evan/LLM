[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: \nGiven an array of integers, find the index of the first occurrence of a specific target value in the array. If the target value is not found, return -1.\n\nExample:\nInput: arr = [4, 6, 8, 2, 4, 7], target = 4\nOutput: 0\nExplanation: The target value 4 is first found at index 0 in the array.\n\nSolution:\nMaintain a variable to hold the index of the target value found so far. Initialize the variable to -1. Traverse the array and update the variable if the target value is found. \n\n2. Problem: \nGiven an array of characters, find the index of the first occurrence of a specific target character in the array.
