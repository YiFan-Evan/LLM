Problem: Write a Python function to find the middle element of an array. The function should return the middle element of the given array if the array has odd length, and the element to the left of the middle one if the array has even length.\n\nSolution: First, we check if the length of the array is odd or even. If it's odd, we return the middle element. If it's even, we return the element to the left of the middle.\n\n2. Problem: Write a Python function to find the maximum element in an array.\n\nSolution: Initialize a variable to store the maximum value found so far. Iterate through the array, updating the maximum value if a larger element is found.\n\n3.

The function should return the middle element of the given array if the array has odd length, and the element to the left of the middle one if the array has even length.\n\nSolution: If the length of the array is odd, the middle element is at position len(arr)//2. If the length is even, the middle element is at position len(arr)//2-1. Return the respective element based on the length of the array.\n\n2.

Problem: Write a Python function to determine if all elements in an array are positive.\n\nSolution: Initialize a boolean variable to True.
