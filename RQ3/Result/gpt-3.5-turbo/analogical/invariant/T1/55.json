[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

Problem: \nYou are given a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order. Write a Python function to find the number of occurrences of a specific target integer in the list.\n\nSolution:\n1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.\n2. Iterate over the list and check if the current element is equal to the target.\n3. If they are equal, increment the `count` variable.\n4. Finally, return the `count` variable.\n\n2. Problem:\nYou are given an array of strings and a target string. Write a Python function to count the occurrences of the target string in the array.\n\nSolution:\n1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.\n2. Traverse the array and for each string, check if it is equal to the target string.\n3. If they are equal, increase the count by 1.\n4. Finally, return the count of occurrences of the target string in the array.\n\n3. Problem:\nGiven a list of tuples and a target tuple, write a Python function to calculate the number of occurrences of the target tuple in the list.\n\nSolution:\n1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.\n2. Iterate over the list of tuples and compare each tuple with the target tuple.\n3. If a tuple matches the target tuple, increment the `count` variable.\n4.

Problem:\nYou are given an array of integers and a target integer. Implement a Python function to find the count of occurrences of the target integer in the array.\n\nSolution:\n1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.\n2. Iterate through the array and for each element, check if it is equal to the target integer.\n3. If they are equal, increment the `count` variable.\n4. Repeat the above steps for all elements in the array.\n5. Finally, return the total count of occurrences of the target integer in the array.\n\n2. Problem:\nGiven a list of characters and a target character, write a Python function to determine the number of occurrences of the target character in the list.\n\nSolution:\n1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.\n2. Iterate over the list and for each character in the list, check if it matches the target character.\n3. If the characters match, increment the `count` variable.\n4. Continue this process for all characters in the list.\n5. Return the total count of occurrences of the target character in the list.\n\n3. Problem:\nYou are provided with a list of lists and a target list. Implement a Python function to compute the count of occurrences of the target list in the main list.\n\nSolution:\n1. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.\n2. Iterate through the main list and compare each sublist with the target list.\n3. If a sublist matches the target list, increment the `count` variable.\n4. Repeat the comparison for all sublists in the main list.\n5.
