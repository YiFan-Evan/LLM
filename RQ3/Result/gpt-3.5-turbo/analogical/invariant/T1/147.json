[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: Write a loop invariant for the selection sort algorithm.\nSolution: The selection sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The sorted part of the array is built from left to right. \n\n2. Problem: Write a loop invariant for the binary search algorithm.\nSolution: The binary search algorithm is a fast search algorithm with the time complexity of O(log n). It works on sorted arrays. It starts in the middle of the sorted array and does not have to sift through the entire array to find the target value.\n\n3. Problem: Write a loop invariant for the factorial calculation algorithm using recursion.\nSolution: The factorial calculation algorithm using recursion is an algorithm that calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer n. It calls itself with a decreased value of n until it reaches the base case of 0 where it returns 1.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"sum_value = sum(arr[0:h])\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        sum_value += arr[h]\n        h += 1\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Problem: Write a loop invariant for the merge sort algorithm.\nSolution: The merge sort algorithm is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves.\n\n2. Problem: Write a loop invariant for the linear search algorithm.\nSolution: The linear search algorithm is a simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.\n\n3. Problem: Write a loop invariant for the bubble sort algorithm.\nSolution: The bubble sort algorithm is a sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"sum_value = sum(arr[0:h])\"."}]
