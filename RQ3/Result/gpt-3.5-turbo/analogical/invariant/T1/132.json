The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: Implement a function that calculates the sum of all elements in an array.\n\nSolution: Initialize a variable to store the sum of elements. Iterate through the array and add each element to the sum. Finally, return the sum.\n\n3. Problem: Implement a function that checks if all elements in an array are positive.\n\nSolution: Iterate through the array elements and check if each element is greater than 0.

Problem: Implement a function that checks if all elements in an array are even.\n\nSolution: Iterate through the array elements and check if each element is even by performing the modulo operation with 2. If all elements are even, return True; otherwise, return False.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'm = m'"}]
