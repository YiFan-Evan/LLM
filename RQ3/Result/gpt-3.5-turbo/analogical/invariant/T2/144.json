[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: Loop invariant for calculating the maximum value in an array.\nDescription: Given an array, the loop iterates through each element to find the maximum value.\nSolution:\n```python\nmax_value = max(arr[0:e])\n```\n\n2. Problem: Loop invariant for checking if all elements in an array are positive.\nDescription: The loop goes through each element in the array to check if all values are positive.\nSolution:\n```python\nall_positive = all(x > 0 for x in arr[0:e])\n```\n\n3. Problem: Loop invariant for counting the number of occurrences of a specific value in an array.\nDescription: The loop counts the occurrences of a specific value in an array.\nSolution:\n```python\ncount_value = sum(1 for x in arr[0:e] if x == target_value)\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n```python\nsum_value = sum(arr[0:e])\n```"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    e = -1\n    while e < len(arr) - 1:\n        e += 1\n        sum_value += arr[e]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.
