[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

Problem: Write a loop invariant for calculating the sum of elements in an array.\n   Description: Given an array, write a function to calculate the sum of elements in the array using a loop. The loop invariant should assist in proving the partial correctness of the program.\n   Solution: Establish a loop invariant in the form 'sum_value = sum(arr[0]->arr[e-1])'.\n\n3. Problem: Write a loop invariant for checking if all elements in an array are positive.\n   Description: Write a function to check if all elements in an array are positive using a loop. The loop invariant should help in demonstrating the partial correctness of the program.\n   Solution: Formulate a loop invariant in the form 'all_positive = all(arr[0]->arr[e-1] > 0)'.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'last_value = arr[0]->arr[e-1]'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_last(arr):\n    last_value = arr[0]\n    e = -1\n    while e < len(arr) - 1:\n        e += 1\n        last_value = arr[e]\n    return last_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Problem: Write a loop invariant for finding the minimum value in an array.\n   Description: Given an array, write a function to find the minimum value in the array using a loop.
