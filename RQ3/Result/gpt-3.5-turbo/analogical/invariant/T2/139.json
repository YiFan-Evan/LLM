[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Once the loop ends, we can return the second element from the middle of the array.\n\nUpdated code:\n\ndef give_second_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    prev_mid_value = None\n    t = 0\n    while 2 * t < len(arr):\n        prev_mid_value = mid_value\n        mid_value = arr[t]\n        t += 1\n    return prev_mid_value\n\n\nRelated problem 2:\n\nProblem: Modify the function to return the first element from the middle of the array.\n\nSolution: To return the first element from the middle of the array, we need to remove the assignment of mid_value at the start of each iteration and return mid_value once the loop ends.\n\nUpdated code:\n\ndef give_first_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    t = 0\n    while 2 * t < len(arr):\n        t += 1\n    return mid_value\n\n\nRelated problem 3:\n\nProblem: Modify the function to return the sum of all the elements in the array.\n\nSolution: To calculate the sum of all the elements in the array, we can initialize a sum variable to 0 and add each element to it in each iteration.
