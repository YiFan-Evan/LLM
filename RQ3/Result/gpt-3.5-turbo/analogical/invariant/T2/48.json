Problem: Write a loop invariant for a loop that checks if all elements in an array are positive.\nSolution: We can write a loop invariant as 'all_positive = all(x > 0 for x in arr[0:i])', where 'all_positive' is True if all elements from index 0 to i are positive in the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\n3.
