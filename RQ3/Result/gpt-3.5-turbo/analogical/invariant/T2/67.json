[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Problem: \n   Description: Suppose we have a program that searches for a target element in an array and returns its index.
