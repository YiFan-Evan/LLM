[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: \nProblem Description: You need to find the index of the maximum element in the given array.\nSolution:\n1. Start with the index 0 and the current maximum as the first element of the array.\n2. Iterate through the array, updating the current maximum and its index whenever you find a larger element.\n3. After iterating through the entire array, the index of the maximum element is stored in the variable.\n4. Return the index of the maximum element.\n\n2. Problem:\nProblem Description: Check if a given element is present in the array.\nSolution:\n1. Initialize a flag variable to False.\n2. Iterate through the array, and if the element is found, set the flag variable to True and break from the loop.\n3. After iterating through the entire array, if the flag variable is True, return True indicating the element is present; otherwise, return False.\n\n3. Problem:\nProblem Description: Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.\nSolution:\n1. Initialize a sum variable to 0.\n2. Iterate through the array, adding each element to the sum variable.\n3. After iterating through the entire array, the sum of all elements in the array is stored in the sum variable.\n4.

Problem: \nProblem Description: Find the index of the first occurrence of a given element `target` in the array `arr`.\nSolution:\n1. Initialize the index variable `id_value` to -1, indicating the element is not found.\n2. Start iterating through the elements of the array.\n3. If the current element is equal to the target element, update the `id_value` with the current index.\n4. Continue iterating until the end of the array or until the target element is found.\n5.

Problem:\nProblem Description: Determine if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\nSolution:\n1. Initialize a boolean variable `is_sorted` to True.\n2. Iterate through the array, comparing each element with the next element.\n3. If at any point, an element is greater than the next element, set `is_sorted` to False and break from the loop.\n4. After iterating through the entire array, if `is_sorted` is still True, the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'i_value = i'."}]
