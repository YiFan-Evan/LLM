[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: Provide a loop invariant for a loop that finds the maximum element in an array.\n   Description: Given an array, the loop iterates to find the maximum element in the array.\n   Solution: The loop invariant could be 'max_value = max(arr[0:i])'.\n\n2. Problem: Provide a loop invariant for a loop that calculates the sum of the first n elements in an array.\n   Description: The loop computes the sum of the first n elements in the array.\n   Solution: The loop invariant could be 'sum_value = sum(arr[0:i])'.\n\n3. Problem: Provide a loop invariant for a loop that checks if an array is sorted in ascending order.\n   Description: The loop compares adjacent elements to determine if the array is sorted in ascending order.\n   Solution: The loop invariant could be 'sorted_value = all(arr[j] <= arr[j+1] for j in range(i-1))'.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'z_value = arr[z-1] > arr[z]'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    n = -1\n    while n < len(arr) - 1:\n        n += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Problem: Provide a loop invariant for a loop that counts the number of negative elements in an array.\n   Description: The loop counts the number of negative elements in the array.\n   Solution: The loop invariant could be 'neg_count = len([x for x in arr if x < 0])'.\n\n2.
