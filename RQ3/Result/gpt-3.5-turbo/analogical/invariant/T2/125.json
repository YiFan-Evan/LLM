[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: Write a Python function to find the maximum value in an array.\n\n   Description: The function takes an array as input and iterates over it to find the maximum value. The maximum value found in the array is returned by the function.\n\n   Solution:\n   ```python\n   def find_max(arr):\n       max_value = arr[0]\n       i = 0\n       while i < len(arr):\n           max_value = max(max_value, arr[i])\n           i += 1\n       return max_value\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Write a Python function to calculate the sum of all elements in an array.\n\n   Description: The function accepts an array as input and computes the sum of all elements in the array. The sum is returned by the function.\n\n   Solution:\n   ```python\n   def find_sum(arr):\n       sum_value = 0\n       i = 0\n       while i < len(arr):\n           sum_value += arr[i]\n           i += 1\n       return sum_value\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Write a Python function to check if all elements in an array are positive.\n\n   Description: This function checks if all elements in an array are positive numbers by iterating over the array. It returns True if all elements are positive, otherwise False.\n\n   Solution:\n   ```python\n   def all_positive(arr):\n       i = 0\n       while i < len(arr):\n           if arr[i] <= 0:\n               return False\n           i += 1\n       return True\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'f = fun(arr[0]->arr[f-1])'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    f = -1\n    while 2 * f < len(arr) - 2:\n        f += 1\n        mid_value = arr[f]\n    return mid_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Problem: Write a Python function to find the minimum value in an array.\n\n   Description: The function takes an array as input and iterates over it to find the minimum value. The minimum value found in the array is returned by the function.\n\n   Solution:\n   ```python\n   def find_min(arr):\n       min_value = arr[0]\n       i = 0\n       while i < len(arr):\n           min_value = min(min_value, arr[i])\n           i += 1\n       return min_value\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Write a Python function to count the number of even elements in an array.\n\n   Description: The function accepts an array as input and counts the number of even elements in the array. The count is returned by the function.\n\n   Solution:\n   ```python\n   def count_even(arr):\n       count = 0\n       i = 0\n       while i < len(arr):\n           if arr[i] % 2 == 0:\n               count += 1\n           i += 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\n3. Problem: Write a Python function to check if an array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n   Description: This function checks if an array is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating over the array. It returns True if the array is sorted, otherwise False.\n\n   Solution:\n   ```python\n   def is_sorted(arr):\n       i = 1\n       while i < len(arr):\n           if arr[i] < arr[i-1]:\n               return False\n           i += 1\n       return True\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'f = fun(-1->f-1)'."}]
