[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

In each iteration, we update `sum_value` to contain the sum of elements from index 0 to i. This helps in verifying that the sum is being calculated correctly throughout the loop.\n\n2. **Problem**: Provide a loop invariant for a loop that finds the maximum element in an array.\n\n   **Loop**: for i in range(len(arr)).\n\n   **Loop Invariant**: `max_value = max(arr[0:i])`.\n\n   **Solution**: We keep track of the maximum element found in the array up to the i-th index in the `max_value` variable.
