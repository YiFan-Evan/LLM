Problem: Write a loop invariant for a binary search algorithm to find the index of the target element in a sorted array.\n\nSolution: Initialize two pointers `low` and `high` representing the start and end indices of the search space. In each iteration, update the pointers based on the comparison of the target value with the middle element of the subarray.\n\n2. Problem: Write a loop invariant for an algorithm to compute the maximum element in an array.\n\nSolution: Maintain a variable `max_value` to store the current maximum element found in the array. Update `max_value` in every iteration if a greater element is encountered.\n\n3. Problem: Write a loop invariant for an algorithm that counts the frequency of a given element in an array.\n\nSolution: Keep track of a variable `count` to store the frequency of the target element in the array.

Problem: Write a loop invariant for an algorithm that finds the minimum element in an array.\n\nSolution: Keep track of a variable `min_value` to store the current minimum element found in the array. Update `min_value` in every iteration if a smaller element is encountered.\n\n3. Problem: Write a loop invariant for an algorithm that checks if an array is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nSolution: Maintain a boolean variable `is_sorted` to track whether the array is sorted in non-decreasing order up to the current index `o`.
