[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The function `give_id` aims to find the index of the target integer in the array. If the target integer is not found, the function returns -1. \n   **Example Input:** `arr = [4, 2, 7, 1, 5]`, `target = 7`\n   **Example Output:** `2` (since the index of the target `7` in the array is 2)\n        \n   **Solution:** \n   - Initialization: `id_value = -1`, `j = 0`. At the beginning, the `id_value` is set to -1 and the loop variable `j` is set to 0.\n   - Maintenance: At each iteration, we check if the element at index `j` is equal to the target.

The function `give_id` is intended to find the index of the target integer in the array. If the target integer is not found, the function returns -1.\n   **Example Input:** `arr = [7, 3, 9, 5, 2]`, `target = 9`\n   **Example Output:** `2` (as the target `9` is present at index 2 in the array)\n        \n   **Solution:** \n   - Initialization: `id_value = -1`, `j = -1`. Initially, `id_value` is set to -1 and `j` is initialized to -1.\n   - Maintenance: In each iteration, we increment `j` by 1.
