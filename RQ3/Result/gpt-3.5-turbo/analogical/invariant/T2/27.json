[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

Problem: Write a loop invariant for a loop that traverses an array to find the sum of all elements.\n   Description: The program contains a loop that iterates over an array and calculates the sum of all elements.\n   Solution: Loop invariant - 'sum_value = sum(arr[0:h])'\n\n2. Problem: Write a loop invariant for a loop that searches for the maximum element in an array.\n   Description: The program includes a loop that scans an array to find the maximum element present in it.\n   Solution: Loop invariant - 'max_value = max(arr[0:h])'\n\n3.
