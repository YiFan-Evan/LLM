Problem: Provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of a selection sort algorithm.\n2. Problem: Provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of a bubble sort algorithm.\n3. Problem: Provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of an insertion sort algorithm.\n\nSolution to Problem 1 (Selection Sort):\nLoop Invariant: At the beginning of the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the selection sort algorithm, the subarray arr[0:i-1] is sorted in non-decreasing order.\nExplanation: The selection sort algorithm divides the input array into two subarrays - sorted and unsorted. The loop invariant ensures that the subarray arr[0:i-1] is sorted after each iteration of the outer loop.\n\nSolution to Problem 2 (Bubble Sort):\nLoop Invariant: At the beginning of the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the bubble sort algorithm, the largest i elements are in their correct sorted positions at the end of the array.\nExplanation: The bubble sort algorithm moves the largest element to its correct position in each iteration. The loop invariant ensures that after each iteration, the i largest elements are in their correct sorted positions.\n\nSolution to Problem 3 (Insertion Sort):\nLoop Invariant: At the beginning of the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the insertion sort algorithm, the subarray arr[0:i-1] is sorted in non-decreasing order.\nExplanation: The insertion sort algorithm inserts the i-th element into its correct position within the sorted subarray arr[0:i-1].

Problem: Provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of a bubble sort algorithm with a descending loop variable.\n\nSolution to Problem 1 (Selection Sort with Descending Loop Variable):\nLoop Invariant: At the beginning of the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the selection sort algorithm with a descending loop variable, the subarray arr[d+1:len(arr)] is sorted in non-increasing order.\nExplanation: In this variation of selection sort, the loop variable 'd' decreases from len(arr) to 1.
