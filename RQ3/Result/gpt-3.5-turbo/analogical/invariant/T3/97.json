[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: Write a loop invariant for finding the maximum element in an array.\n   Description: Given an array, write a loop invariant for a loop that iterates over the array elements to find the maximum element in the array.\n   Solution: Invariant: 'max_value = max(arr[0:r])'.\n\n2. Problem: Write a loop invariant for computing the sum of elements in an array.\n   Description: Given an array, write a loop invariant for a loop that iterates over the array elements to compute the sum of all elements in the array.\n   Solution: Invariant: 'sum_value = sum(arr[0:r])'.\n\n3. Problem: Write a loop invariant for counting the number of even elements in an array.\n   Description: Given an array, write a loop invariant for a loop that iterates over the array elements to count the number of even elements in the array.\n   Solution: Invariant: 'even_count = sum(1 for num in arr[0:r] if num % 2 == 0)'.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'last_value = arr[r]'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_first(arr):\n    first_value = arr[-1]\n    r = len(arr)\n    while r > 0:\n        r -= 1\n        first_value = arr[r]\n    return first_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.
