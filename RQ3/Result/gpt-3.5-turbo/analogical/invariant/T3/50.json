[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

The function `is_present(arr, target)` takes an array `arr` and a target element `target` as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the target element is present in the array.\n**Solution:** We can utilize a loop invariant to ensure the correctness of the program.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"count_value = count_elements(arr[0:k], target)\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_count(arr, target):\n    count_value = 0\n    k = len(arr)\n    while k > 0:\n        k -= 1\n        if arr[k] == target:\n            count_value += 1\n    return count_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **Problem 1:**\n**Description:** Suppose we have a program that calculates the product of all elements in an array.
