We iterate over the elements of the array using a while loop by maintaining a variable k. We check if the current index k is less than the provided id, and if true, we continue to the next iteration.

The id of the member is provided as input.\nSolution: The loop starts with k initialized to the length of the array. Then, in each iteration, k is decremented by 1 until it reaches 0. On each iteration, the member_value remains unchanged if the current index k is not equal to the provided id. If k is equal to the provided id, the member_value is updated to the element at index k.
