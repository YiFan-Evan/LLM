[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

Problem: \n   Description: Write a Python program that finds the maximum element in an array and returns its index.\n   Solution: Iterate through the array, update the index of the maximum element whenever a larger element is found, and return the index at the end.\n   \n2. Problem:\n   Description: Write a Python program that computes the sum of all positive integers in an array.\n   Solution: Iterate through the array, check if the element is positive, and add it to the sum if it is. Return the sum at the end.\n   \n3. Problem:\n   Description: Write a Python program that counts the occurrence of a specific element in an array.\n   Solution: Iterate through the array, increment a counter whenever the specific element is found, and return the counter at the end.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"s_value = fun(arr[s-1]->arr[s-1])\""}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    s = len(arr)\n    while s > 0:\n        s -= 1\n        if s == id:\n            member_value = arr[s]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. Problem:\n   Description: Write a Python program that finds the minimum element in an array and returns its value.\n   Solution: Initialize a variable with a very large value, iterate through the array, update the variable with the element if it is smaller than the current value, and return the variable at the end.\n\n2. Problem:\n   Description: Write a Python program that checks if all elements in an array are even numbers.\n   Solution: Iterate through the array, check if each element is even, and return False if an odd number is found. Return True at the end if all elements are even.\n\n3. Problem:\n   Description: Write a Python program that calculates the average of all elements in an array.\n   Solution: Initialize a sum variable to 0 and a count variable to 0, iterate through the array, add each element to the sum, and increment the count.
