[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The function starts by initializing a variable 'max_value' to the first element of the array.

The function initializes a variable 'sum' to 0 and then iterates through the array elements, adding each element to the 'sum' variable.\nSolution: You need to provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the find_sum function to prove the partial correctness of the program.\n\nRelated Problem 3:\nFunction name: is_sorted\nDescription: You are given a Python function that checks whether the elements in an array are sorted in non-decreasing order. The function iterates through the array elements and compares each element to the previous one.\nSolution: Provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the is_sorted function to prove the partial correctness of the program.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'min_value = min(arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[i-1])'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[-1]\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        i -= 1\n        if arr[i] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[i]\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Related Problem 1:\nFunction name: find_max\nDescription: You are given a Python function that finds the maximum value in an array. The function starts by initializing a variable 'max_value' to the last element of the array.
