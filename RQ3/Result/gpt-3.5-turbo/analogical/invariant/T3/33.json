[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

Problem: Write a Python program to calculate the sum of all elements in a list using a loop.\n   \n   Solution: Write a program that initializes a variable sum_value to 0 and then iterates over the list, adding each element to the sum.\n\n3. Problem: Write a Python program to count the number of even numbers in a list using a loop.\n   \n   Solution: Write a program that initializes a variable count_even to 0 and then iterates over the list, incrementing count_even each time an even number is encountered.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n'i_value = fun(arr[i-1]->arr[i-1])'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[-1]\n    n = len(arr)\n    while n > 0:\n        n -= 1\n        if arr[n] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[n]\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1.

Problem: Write a Python program to find the average of all elements in a list using a loop.\n\n   Solution: Write a program that initializes a variable sum_value to 0 and a variable count to the length of the list. Then iterate over the list, adding each element to the sum, and finally divide the sum by the count to get the average.\n\n3. Problem: Write a Python program to find the median of a list of integers in ascending order using a loop.\n\n   Solution: Sort the list in ascending order first.
