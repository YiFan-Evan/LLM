[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

If the array has an odd number of elements, the middle element is the one in the middle of the array. If the array has an even number of elements, the middle element is the one just before the middle of the array.\n\n**Solution**: We can iterate through the array from the start and update the middle element until we reach the middle index of the array.\n\n2. **Problem**: Write a function to find the smallest element in an array.\n\n**Solution**: We can iterate through the array and keep track of the smallest element seen so far. Update this variable whenever we find a smaller element.\n\n3. **Problem**: Write a function to compute the sum of elements in an array.\n\n**Solution**: We can iterate through the array and keep a running sum of elements seen so far.

Update this variable whenever we find a larger element.\n\n3. **Problem**: Write a function to check if all elements in an array are positive.\n\n**Solution**: We can iterate through the array in reverse order and check if all elements are positive.
