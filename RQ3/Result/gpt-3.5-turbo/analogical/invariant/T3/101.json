Problem: Write a program to find the maximum element in an array.\n\n   Description: Given an array of integers, the program should iterate through the array and keep track of the maximum element found so far.\n\n   Solution:\n   ```python\n   def find_max(arr):\n       max_value = float('-inf')\n       i = 0\n       while i < len(arr):\n           if arr[i] > max_value:\n               max_value = arr[i]\n           i += 1\n       return max_value\n   ```\n\n2. Problem: Write a program to find the sum of all elements in an array.\n\n   Description: Given an array of integers, the program should iterate through the array and calculate the sum of all elements.\n\n   Solution:\n   ```python\n   def find_sum(arr):\n       sum_value = 0\n       j = 0\n       while j < len(arr):\n           sum_value += arr[j]\n           j += 1\n       return sum_value\n   ```\n\n3.

Problem: Write a program to count the number of occurrences of a specific element in an array.\n\n   Description: Given an array of integers and a target element, the program should iterate through the array and count the number of occurrences of the target element.\n\n   Solution:\n   ```python\n   def count_element(arr, target):\n       count = 0\n       k = len(arr)\n       while k > 0:\n           k -= 1\n           if arr[k] == target:\n               count += 1\n       return count\n   ```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'member_value = (arr[b] if b == id else member_value)'."}]
