[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

Problem: \nDescription: Given a list of integers, the program calculates the sum of all elements in the list using a loop.\nExample: If the input list is [1, 2, 3], the expected output is 6 (1 + 2 + 3).\nSolution: Start with an initial sum value of 0. Iterate over the elements in the list, adding each element to the sum value.\n\n2. Problem: \nDescription: The goal is to find the product of all elements in a given list of integers.\nExample: If the input list is [2, 3, 4], the expected output is 24 (2 * 3 * 4).\nSolution: Initialize a product variable to 1.
