[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

In each iteration, update `max_value` to the maximum of the elements seen so far.\n\n2. **Problem 2:**\n   **Description:** Given an array `arr` of integers, we want to find the sum of all elements in the array.\n   **Loop Invariant:** `sum_value = sum(arr[0:r-1])`\n   **Solution:** Initialize `sum_value` to 0. In each iteration, add the value at index `r` to `sum_value`.\n\n3. **Problem 3:**\n   **Description:** Given an array `arr` of integers, we wish to determine if the array contains a specific target value.\n   **Loop Invariant:** `found_value = (target in arr[0:r-1])`\n   **Solution:** Set `found_value` to false initially.
