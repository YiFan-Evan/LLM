[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format.)(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

It aims to find the target string in the list and return its index.\nSolution: It loops through the strings in the list and updates the index when the target string is found.\n\n3. **Problem 3:**\nDescription: The function takes a list of tuples and a key. It searches for the key in the first value of each tuple and returns the corresponding second value.\nSolution: The loop in the function iterates through the tuples in the list and updates the value when the key is found.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** 'member_value = arr[t] if (t == id) else member_value'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    t = len(arr)\n    while t > 0:\n        t -= 1\n        if t == id:\n            member_value = arr[t]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "1. **Problem 1:**\nDescription: The function accepts a list of integers and a target number. The purpose is to find the target number in the list and return its index.\nSolution: The code iterates through the list in reverse order, updating the index when the target number is found.\n\n2. **Problem 2:**\nDescription: Given a list of characters and a target character, the program is designed to locate the target character in the list and return its position.\nSolution: The loop runs from the end of the list towards the beginning, updating the position when the target character is found.\n\n3. **Problem 3:**\nDescription: This function takes a list of tuples and a key. It looks for the key in the second value of each tuple and returns the corresponding first value.\nSolution: The code iterates through the tuples in reverse, updating the value when the key is found in the second part of a tuple.\n\n**Therefore, the final answer is:** 'member_value = arr[t] if (t == id) else member_value'"}]
