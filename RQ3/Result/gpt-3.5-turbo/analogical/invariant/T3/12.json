Since `max_value` is initialized as `arr[-1]`, it is the maximum value of the last element itself, which satisfies the loop invariant.\n\n*Maintenance:*\n\nAssuming the loop invariant is true for the i-th iteration (`max_value` contains the maximum value among the elements `arr[m], arr[m+1], ..., arr[-1]`), we need to show that it holds for the (i+1)-th iteration.\n\nIn the (i+1)-th iteration, we decrement `m` by 1. Since the loop invariant holds for the i-th iteration, `max_value` is the maximum value among the elements `arr[m], arr[m+1], ..., arr[-1]` at the start of the i-th iteration.\n\nIf `arr[m] > max_value`, then `arr[m]` is the maximum value and we update `max_value` to `arr[m]`. Otherwise, `max_value` remains the maximum value.\n\nTherefore, after the (i+1)-th iteration, `max_value` contains the maximum value among the elements `arr[m], arr[m+1], ..., arr[-1]`. The loop invariant still holds.\n\n*Termination:*\n\nThe loop terminates when `m = 0`. At this point, `max_value` contains the maximum value among the elements `arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[-1]`. Since the loop invariant holds, we can conclude that `max_value` is the maximum value in the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `max_value = arr[0]->arr[-1]`."}]
