[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

(2) Everything that is discordant and a rompus is a gorpus. (3) Everything that is overcast and a rompus is a yumpus.] Prove: (4) If something is opaque, discordant, and overcast, it is a gorpus.\nSolution: By using premises (1), (2), and (3), we can infer that something that is opaque and a grimpus is a rompus (from (1)), a rompus that is discordant is a gorpus (from (2)), and a rompus that is overcast is a yumpus (from (3)).

According to premise (1), if Wren is discordant and a rompus, then Taylor is a visionary. Therefore, if Wren is indeed discordant and a rompus, Taylor must be a visionary. The necessary premise set is (1)->(2).\n\nRelated problem 2:\nPremises: [(11) Wren is a grimpus. (12) Wren is opaque.
