[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

From premise (11), we know that Max is mean, kind, an impus, and a lorpus. Since Max is a lorpus (as per premise 6), we can infer that Max is a rompus (from premise 3).

From premise 5, we know that every rompus is a zumpus and a shumpus. Since Max is a shumpus (as per premise 2 and 10), Max is also a rompus.

From premise 6, we know that a yumpus is, in fact, a lorpus. Since Max is a yumpus (as per premise 9) and thus a lorpus, we can conclude that Max is a rompus.
