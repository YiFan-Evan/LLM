[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

(3) Zumpuses are jompuses. (4) Every rompus is a tumpus.] Prove: (5) Zumpuses are tumpuses.\n\nSolution 1: By combining premise (1) and premise (4), we can conclude that Zumpuses are tumpuses. Therefore, the answer is: (1),(4)->(5).\n\nProblem 2:\nPremises: [(6) Zumpuses are opaque. (7) Numpuses are impuses. (8) Jompuses are windy.] Prove: (9) Numpuses are windy.\n\nSolution 2: From premise (7) and premise (6), we can derive that Numpuses are impuses and Zumpuses are opaque. However, premise (8) does not directly help in proving Numpuses are windy. Therefore, the minimum premises required to prove the conclusion are (6) and (7). Hence, the answer is: (6),(7)->(9).\n\nProblem 3:\nPremises: [(10) Vumpuses are not liquid. (11) Every lempus is a zumpus. (12) Numpuses are not temperate.] Prove: (13) Vumpuses are not temperate.\n\nSolution 3: To prove that Vumpuses are not temperate, we need to establish a connection between Vumpuses and being not temperate. From premise (10) and (11), we can conclude that Vumpuses are not liquid and Every lempus is a zumpus. However, neither of these premises directly links Vumpuses to being not temperate. To introduce this link, we need to add premise (12).
