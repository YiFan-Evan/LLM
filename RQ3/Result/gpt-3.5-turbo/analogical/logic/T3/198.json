We can start by using premise (7), which states that every yumpus is a vumpus, a grimpus, and a brimpus. Combining this with premise (5), which states that yumpuses are shumpuses, we can conclude that every shumpus is a vumpus, a grimpus, and a brimpus (by transitive property).\n\nUsing premise (10), which states that each vumpus is a lorpus, we can further conclude that every shumpus is also a lorpus (by transitive property).\n\nNext, we can use premise (6), which states that everything that is a rompus, a numpus, and a dumpus is a lorpus. Since we already know that Polly is a rompus (premise 3), a numpus (premise 9), and a dumpus (premise 2), we can conclude that Polly is a lorpus.\n\nFinally, combining the fact that Polly is a lorpus and that every lorpus is a vumpus, grimpus, and brimpus (from conclusions above), we can conclude that Polly is a brimpus, a grimpus, or a jompus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (3),(9),(2),(7),(5),(10),(6)->(16)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Polly is a brimpus, a grimpus, or a jompus then Taylor is a visionary.

From the given premises, we are given that \"if Polly is a brimpus, a grimpus, or a jompus then Taylor is a visionary\" as premise (1).
