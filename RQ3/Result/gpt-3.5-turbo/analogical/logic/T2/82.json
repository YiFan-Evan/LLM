[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

(2) Lorpuses are gorpuses and wumpuses. (3) Zumpuses are brimpuses and gorpuses. (4) Every gorpus is a yumpus and a jompus.] Prove: (5) Zumpuses are yumpuses.\nSolution: From premise (2), we have 'Lorpuses are gorpuses and wumpuses.' From premise (3), we have 'Zumpuses are brimpuses and gorpuses.' By transitivity, we can conclude that 'Zumpuses are yumpuses.'\n\nRelated Problem 2:\nPremises: [(1) Every plumpus is a klumpus and a glumpus. (2) Every klumpus is a humpus and a jumpus. (3) Zumpuses are glumpuses and humpuses.] Prove: (4) Zumpuses are kumpuses.\nSolution: From premise (1), we have 'Every plumpus is a klumpus and a glumpus.' From premise (2), we have 'Every klumpus is a humpus and a jumpus.' By transitivity, we can conclude that 'Every plumpus is a humpus and a jumpus.' Thus, 'Every plumpus is a humpus.'

Then from premise (2), we have 'Every pumpus is a mumpus and a rumpus.' Combining the derived conclusion, we get 'Every pumpus is a lumpus, a sumpus, and a rumpus.' Finally, from premise (1), we have 'Tumpuses are lumpuses or pumpuses.'
