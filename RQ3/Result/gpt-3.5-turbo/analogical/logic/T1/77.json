[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

However, none of the given premises directly state this. Therefore, we cannot prove that Rex is a dumpus using the given premises.\n\nProblem 2: Prove that Rex is a jompus.\nDescription: In this problem, we are given a set of premises and asked to prove that Rex is a jompus.\nSolution: To prove that Rex is a jompus, we need to find a premise that states that Rex is a jompus. From premise (7), we know that each tumpus is a jompus. Since Rex is a tumpus according to premise (8), we can conclude that Rex is a jompus.\n\nProblem 3: Prove that Rex is a brown numpus.\nDescription: In this problem, we are given a set of premises and asked to prove that Rex is a brown numpus.\nSolution: To prove that Rex is a brown numpus, we need to find a premise that states that Rex is a brown numpus. From premise (9), we know that Rex is a vumpus and a numpus. From premise (2), we know that vumpuses are brown.
