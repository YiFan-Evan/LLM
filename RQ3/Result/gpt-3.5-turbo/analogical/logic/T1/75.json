The first problem asks us to prove that Wren is sunny and a tumpus. To prove this, we need to find the minimum set of premises that lead to this conclusion.\n\nIn problem 1, we can observe that premise (15) states that Wren is sunny, and premise (16) states that Wren is wooden, which leads to premise (4) that everything that is wooden and a numpus is a tumpus. Therefore, we can derive the conclusion that Wren is a tumpus, and combining this with premise (15) that Wren is sunny, we can conclude that Wren is sunny and a tumpus. Hence, the minimum set of premises needed is (15), (16), and (4).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (15),(16),(4)->(17)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

Each problem poses a different perspective or aspect related to this premise.\n\nIn problem 1, the goal is to prove that every woman has a son. Since the premise specifically mentions mothers having sons and not every woman having a son, the conclusion cannot be derived from this premise alone. Therefore, the premise itself is insufficient to prove that every woman has a son.\n\nIn problem 2, the aim is to prove that every person has a mother. Similarly to problem 1, the premise does not provide information about the relationship in the reverse direction (from son to mother or from woman to son), so it remains inadequate to prove that every person has a mother.\n\nIn problem 3, the objective is to show that every son has a mother. The premise directly states that every mother has a son, but it does not imply that every son has a mother. Therefore, the given premise alone is not enough to establish that every son has a mother.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: The given premises are not sufficient to prove that Wren is sunny and a tumpus."}]
