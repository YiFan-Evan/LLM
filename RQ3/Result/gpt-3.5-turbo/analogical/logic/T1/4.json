[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

(2) Everything that is a jompus is a numpus. (3) Everything that is a yumpus or an impus is a jompus. (4) Everything that is a numpus is a thumpus. (5) Everything that is a grimpus is a lumpus.] Prove: (6) Everything that is a lorpus is a thumpus, and everything that is an impus is a thumpus.\n\nSolution 1: \nFrom premise (1) and (5), we can derive that everything that is a grimpus is a jompus. Then, from premise (2) and (3), we can conclude that everything that is a yumpus is a jompus. Combining this information with premise (4), we can infer that everything that is a yumpus is a thumpus. Therefore, the conclusion is proven.\n\nRelated Problem 2:\nPremises: [(1) Everything that is a zorp or a worp is a porp. (2) Everything that is a torp or a porp is a norp. (3) Everything that is a zorp or a worp is a norp. (4) Ben is not a norp. (5) Ben is not a porp.] Prove: (6) Ben is not a worp and Ben is not a zorp.\n\nSolution 2:\nFrom premise (1) and (5), we can deduce that everything that is a worp is a porp. Then, from premise (2) and (3), we can infer that everything that is a torp is a norp. Combining this information with premise (4), we find that Ben is not a torp. Therefore, Ben is not a worp. Similarly, we can conclude that Ben is not a zorp. Hence, the statement is proven.\n\nRelated Problem 3:\nPremises: [(1) Everything that is a blorp or a glorp is a thorp. (2) Everything that is a thorp is a florptorp. (3) Everything that is a blorp or a glorp is a florptorp. (4) Chris is not a florptorp. (5) Chris is not a blorp.] Prove: (6) Chris is not a glorp and Chris is not a blorp.\n\nSolution 3:\nCombining premise (1) and (5), we can determine that everything that is a glorp is a thorp. Then, from premise (2) and (3), we can deduce that everything that is a blorp is a florptorp. Since Chris is not a florptorp (from premise 4), Chris must not be a blorp or a glorp. Hence, Chris is not a glorp and not a blorp.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (4),(5)->(6)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.
