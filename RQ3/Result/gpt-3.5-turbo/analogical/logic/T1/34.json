[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

To prove this, we only need the premise (4) because it directly states that lorpuses are vumpuses, and from the premises given, we know that vumpuses are wumpuses. Therefore, (4) is sufficient to prove (13) and the answer is: (4)->(13).\n\nThe second problem asks us to prove that Sam is a vumpus. To prove this, we need the premises (4) and (12) because (12) directly states that Sam is a tumpus, and (4) tells us that tumpuses are vumpuses. Therefore, combining (4) and (12), we can conclude that Sam is a vumpus. Therefore, the answer is: (4),(12)->(5).\n\nThe third problem asks us to prove that Sam is a vumpus. To prove this, we need the premises (5) and (11). From (11), we can conclude that Sam is either a jompus, a tumpus, or an impus. And from (5), we know that every jompus is a vumpus.

(3) Lempuses are wumpuses.]\nProve: (4) Every mother is a wumpus.\n\nIn the first problem, to prove that every mother is a wumpus, we only need the premise (0) which directly states that every mother has a son. As the son is not explicitly defined otherwise, the conclusion can be drawn that every mother is a wumpus. Therefore, (0) is sufficient to prove (2), and the answer is: (0)->(2).\n\nIn the second problem, to prove that every mother is a wumpus, we need the premises (0) and (2). From (0), we establish that every mother has a son, and from (2) we know that every lorpus is a wumpus. Since Sam is either a tumpus, an impus, or a lorpus, it follows that Sam must have a mother who, according to premise (0), is a wumpus. Therefore, the combination of (0) and (2) is sufficient to prove (3). The answer is: (0),(2)->(3).\n\nIn the third problem, to prove that every mother is a wumpus, we need the premises (0), (2), and (3). By combining these premises, we can establish that every mother is a wumpus based on the relations provided in the premises.
