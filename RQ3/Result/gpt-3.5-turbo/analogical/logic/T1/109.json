[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

(7) Every impus is a yumpus.]\nProve: (10) Every impus is not red.\n\nSolution to Problem 1:\nSince every tumpus is an impus, and every impus is a yumpus, we can conclude that every tumpus is a yumpus. Also, given that every yumpus is not temperate and every wumpus is sunny, we can derive that every tumpus is a wumpus. Therefore, the final answer is: (2),(7),(1),(5)->(4).\n\nSolution to Problem 2:\nBy utilizing the premise stating that 'Impuses are rompuses', and the given fact that 'Tumpuses are impuses', we can infer that each tumpus is a rompus. Subsequently, combining this information with the premise 'Each tumpus is transparent' directly yields the conclusion that 'Every tumpus is transparent'. Therefore, the final answer is: (2),(8)->(9).\n\nSolution to Problem 3:\nGiven that each brimpus is a numpus and every impus is a yumpus, we can reason that each impus is not a brimpus. So, from the premise that 'Each brimpus is floral' and the derived conclusion that 'Every impus is a yumpus and not a brimpus', it follows that 'Every impus is not red'.
