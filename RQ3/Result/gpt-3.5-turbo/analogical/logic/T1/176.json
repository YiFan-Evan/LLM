[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first present three related but not identical problems, along with a description of each problem and its solution.

(4) Vumpuses are impuses.] Prove: (5) Everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, or a rompus is a wumpus.\n\nSolution 1: From premise (1), we derive that everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, or a rompus is a zumpus. From premise (4), we deduce that vumpuses are impuses. Since each impus is a wumpus (premise 2), combining the fact that vumpuses are impuses and impuses are wumpuses, we can conclude that everything that is a yumpus, a tumpus, or a rompus is a wumpus.

Combining these two premises, we can conclude that each dumpus is an impus.

From premise (2), we are given that each dumpus is a wumpus. Since each impus is a jompus, and each dumpus is a wumpus, we can deduce that each dumpus is a jompus.

To prove the statement that every son has a mother, we can simply reverse the premise. Therefore, the answer is: (0)->(1).\n\nRelated Problem 3:\nPremises: [(10) Sally is a wumpus and a yumpus and a sterpus.] Prove: (11) Sally is a wumpus or a yumpus.\n\nSolution 3: From premise (10), we are given that Sally is a wumpus.
