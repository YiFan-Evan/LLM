However, in this case, neither of the standard integration techniques can be applied directly.\n\nTherefore, we can try a different approach by using the concept of the Product Rule in integration. The Product Rule states that if we have two functions f(x) and g(x), their product's derivative is given by (f(x) * g'(x) + g(x) * f'(x)). In integration, we can reverse this process to find the integral of a product of two functions.\n\nLet's rewrite the function as a product.
