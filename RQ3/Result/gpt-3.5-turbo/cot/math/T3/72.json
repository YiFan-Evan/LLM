Let u be 1/x and dv be e^x dx.

This can be done by making a substitution. Let y = 1/x^2, then dy = -2/x^3 dx. This simplifies to -dy/2 = 1/x^3 dx.\n\nTherefore, the integral of e^x*(1/x^2) dx becomes \u222be^x*(-dy/2) = -1/2 \u222be^x dy.\n\nIntegrating e^x with respect to y is simply e^x since e^x is not a function of y.\n\nSo, the final result of the indefinite integral is e^x * (1/x) - 1/2 * e^x + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstitute x = 4 into the result: e^4 * (1/4) - 1/2 * e^4 = e^4/4 - e^4/2 = e^4/4 - 2e^4/4 = -e^4/4.\n\nRounding down the result -e^4/4 gives -55.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -55."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x*(1/x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the given function e^x*(1/x) + x, we can integrate each term separately.\n\n1. \u222be^x*(1/x) dx:\nWe have already found this integral in the previous question to be e^x * (1/x) - 1/2 * e^x. \n\n2. \u222bx dx:\nIntegrating x with respect to x results in x^2/2.\n\nNow we add the two integrals together:\n\u222b(e^x*(1/x) + x) dx = e^x * (1/x) - 1/2 * e^x + x^2/2 + C,\nwhere C is the constant of integration.\n\nSubstitute x = 4 into the result:\ne^4 * (1/4) - 1/2 * e^4 + 4^2/2 = e^4/4 - e^4/2 + 8 = -e^4/4 + 8.\n\nRounding down the result -e^4/4 + 8 to the nearest integer results in -54.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -54."}]
