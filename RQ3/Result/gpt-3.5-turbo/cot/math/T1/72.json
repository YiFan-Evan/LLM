The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n\u222b u * v dx = u \u222b v dx - \u222b u' (\u222b v dx) dx,\n\nwhere u and v are functions of x, and u' is the derivative of u with respect to x.\n\nIn this case, let's choose u = 1/x and dv = e^x dx. Therefore, we have:\n\ndu/dx = -1/x^2 and v = \u222b e^x dx = e^x.\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\n\u222b (e^x * (1/x)) dx = (1/x) * e^x - \u222b (-1/x^2) * e^x dx.\n\nNow, we need to determine the indefinite integral of (-1/x^2) * e^x dx. Again, we can use integration by parts:\n\nLet u = (-1/x^2) and dv = e^x dx.\n\ndu/dx = 2/x^3 and v = e^x.\n\nBy the integration by parts formula, we have:\n\n\u222b (-1/x^2) * e^x dx = (-1/x^2) * e^x - \u222b (-2/x^3) * e^x dx.\n\nContinuing with this process, we need to find the indefinite integral of (-2/x^3) * e^x dx. We use integration by parts again:\n\nLet u = (-2/x^3) and dv = e^x dx.\n\ndu/dx = 6/x^4 and v = e^x.\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula, we get:\n\n\u222b (-2/x^3) * e^x dx = (-2/x^3) * e^x - \u222b (6/x^4) * e^x dx.\n\nAt this point, we can see that we have the same integral on the right-hand side as the original integral. So we can substitute that into our equation:\n\n\u222b (-2/x^3) * e^x dx = (-2/x^3) * e^x - (-2/x^3) * e^x + \u222b (6/x^4) * e^x dx.\n\nSimplifying this equation, we find:\n\n\u222b (-2/x^3) * e^x dx = 2/x^3 * e^x + \u222b (6/x^4) * e^x dx.\n\nNow, let's substitute this result back into the previous equation:\n\n\u222b (-1/x^2) * e^x dx = (-1/x^2) * e^x - (-2/x^3) * e^x + 2/x^3 * e^x + \u222b (6/x^4) * e^x dx.\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n\n\u222b (-1/x^2) * e^x dx = (-1/x^2 + 2/x^3) * e^x + \u222b (6/x^4) * e^x dx.\n\nFinally, we substitute this result back into the equation for the original integral:\n\n\u222b (e^x * (1/x)) dx = (1/x) * e^x - (-1/x^2 + 2/x^3) * e^x + \u222b (6/x^4) * e^x dx.\n\nTo find the definite integral, we need to evaluate this expression at x=4:\n\n(1/4) * e^4 - (-1/16 + 2/64) * e^4 + \u222b (6/256) * e^4 dx.\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n(1/4) * e^4 + (1/16) * e^4 + 6/256 * e^4.\n\nTo find the final result, we substitute e^4 = 54.59815 (rounded to 5 decimal places):\n\n(1/4) * 54.59815 + (1/16) * 54.59815 + 6/256 * 54.59815 = 13.6495375 + 3.412384375 + 0.31858984375 \u2248 17.3805117.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 17 (rounded down)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "e^x*(1/x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function e^x * (1/x), we can use integration by parts.\n\nLet's define:\nu = 1/x    (so that du/dx = -1/x^2)\ndv = e^x dx   (so that v = e^x)\n\nUsing the integration by parts formula:\n\u222b u dv = u*v - \u222b v du\n\nPlugging in our definitions:\n\u222b e^x * (1/x) dx = (1/x) * e^x - \u222b e^x * (-1/x^2) dx\n\u222b e^x * (1/x) dx = (1/x) * e^x + \u222b e^x/x^2 dx\n\nNow, we need to compute the integral of e^x/x^2.
