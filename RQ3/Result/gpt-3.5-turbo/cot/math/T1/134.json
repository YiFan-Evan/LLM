Let's assign u = e^sin(x) and dv = dx.\nDifferentiating u, we get du = e^sin(x) * cos(x) dx.\nIntegrating dv, we get v = x.\n\nNow we can use the formula for integration by parts:\n\u222b u dv = uv - \u222b v du\n\nApplying this formula to our case, we have:\n\u222b e^sin(x) dx = x * e^sin(x) - \u222b x * e^sin(x) * cos(x) dx\n\nThe new integral on the right side, \u222b x * e^sin(x) * cos(x) dx, is still not easy to solve.
