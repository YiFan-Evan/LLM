Let's choose:\nu = cos(x)     =>   du = -sin(x) dx\ndv = 1/x        =>   v = ln(x)\n\nApplying the integration by parts:\n\u222b(cos(x)/x) dx = cos(x)*ln(x) - \u222b(-sin(x)*ln(x)) dx\n               = cos(x)*ln(x) + \u222bsin(x)*(1/x) dx\n\nThis integral is similar to the one we previously calculated.
