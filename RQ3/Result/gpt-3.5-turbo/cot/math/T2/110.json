The formula for integration by parts is:\n\n\u222b u dv = u*v - \u222b v du\n\nIn this case, we can choose u = sin(x) and dv = 1/x. Then, we have du = cos(x) dx and v = ln|x|.\n\nApplying the formula, we get:\n\n\u222b (sin(x)/x) dx = u*v - \u222b v du\n\u222b (sin(x)/x) dx = sin(x) * ln|x| - \u222b ln|x| * cos(x) dx\n\nWe need to find \u222b ln|x| * cos(x) dx to complete the integral.
