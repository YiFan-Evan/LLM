According to the power rule, the integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nIn this case, the function is (1/(1+x))*(1/(1+x)). We can simplify this expression by multiplying the denominators:\n\n(1/(1+x))^2 = 1/(1+2x+x^2) = 1/(x^2 + 2x + 1) = 1/((x+1)(x+1))\n\nNow, the function can be written as:\n\n(1/(x+1)(x+1))\n\nTo find the indefinite integral, we can use the substitution method.
