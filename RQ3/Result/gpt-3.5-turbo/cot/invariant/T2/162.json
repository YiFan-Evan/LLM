We can prove the partial correctness of this code by providing a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\n\nLoop invariant: The subarray `arr[0:i]` is sorted in ascending order.\n\nTo prove this loop invariant, we can consider the following cases:\n\n1. Initialization:\n   - Before the first iteration of the outer loop, `i = 0`. At this point, the subarray `arr[0:i]` is empty, and it can be considered sorted.\n\n2.

This ensures that the largest element in the subarray `arr[0:i]` is moved to its correct position.\n   - After the inner loop finishes, the subarray `arr[0:i]` will be sorted in ascending order.\n\n3.

It starts with -1 and increments before entering the loop, leading to the first iteration working on `i = 0` instead of `i = 1` as intended. Therefore, we need to adjust the loop invariant considering the correct value of `i`.\n\nLet's provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop considering the corrected loop initialization:\n\nLoop invariant: The subarray `arr[0:i+1]` is sorted in ascending order.\n\n1.
