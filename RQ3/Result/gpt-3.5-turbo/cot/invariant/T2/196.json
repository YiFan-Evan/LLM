The purpose of the `selection_sort` function is to sort the array in non-decreasing order.\n\nLet's try to understand the state of the array before and after the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\n\n- Before the i-th iteration: At the beginning of each iteration, the subarray from index 0 to q-1 is already sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\n- After the i-th iteration: After the i-th iteration, the element at index q is the (q+1)-th smallest element in the array.
