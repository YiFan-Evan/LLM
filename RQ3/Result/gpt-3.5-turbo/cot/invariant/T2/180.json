The inner loop iterates over the elements of the list starting from index `a+1` and looks for the minimum element in the list from index `a` to the end of the list. If a smaller element is found, it swaps it with the element at index `a`.\n\nLet's define the loop invariant for the inner loop:\n\n- For each iteration `z`, the subarray `arr[0:a]` is sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'a_value = arr[0:a] is sorted in non-decreasing order'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    a = -1\n    while a < len(arr) - 1:\n        a += 1\n        z = a + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[a]:\n                temp = arr[a]\n                arr[a] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this modified version of the selection sort program, the only change made is the initialization of variable `a` to -1 instead of 0 before the outer loop.
