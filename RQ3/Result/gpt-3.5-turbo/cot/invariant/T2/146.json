[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Inside the loop, it adds the value at index 'g' of the array 'arr' to 'sum_value' and increments 'g' by 1. Finally, it returns the value of 'sum_value'.\n\nTo find the loop invariant, we need to identify a condition involving the variables that remains true for every iteration of the loop.
