In this case, the loop is trying to find the maximum value in the input array 'arr'.\n\nLet's analyze the code and identify the loop invariant:\n\n1. Initialization: Before the loop starts (i=0), the variable 'max_value' holds the value of the first element of the array, so the loop invariant can be 'max_value = max(arr[0]->arr[b])'.\n\n2. Maintenance: During each iteration, the loop checks if the element at index 'b' is greater than the current 'max_value'. If it is greater, 'max_value' gets updated to the element at index 'b'.\n\n3.
