The outer loop is responsible for selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and swapping it with the current element.\n\nAt the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop, we can assume that the subarray arr[0:i] is sorted and contains the i smallest elements in their correct order.\n\nLet's assume the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop as:\n\"arr[0:i] is sorted and contains the i smallest elements in their correct order.\"\n\nNow let's prove the loop invariant for the given code:\n\nInitialization:\nBefore the loop starts, when b = 0, the subarray arr[0:0] is empty. Since it has only one element, it trivially contains the 0 smallest element in its correct order.

If arr[z] < arr[b], we swap the values to ensure that arr[b] is the minimum element in arr[b:len(arr)].\n\nAfter the inner loop completes, the minimum element in the unsorted portion (arr[b:len(arr)]) is now at the correct position (index b).\n\nBy swapping the elements and iterating the inner loop once for each b, we ensure that arr[0:b+1] is sorted and contains the (b+1) smallest elements in their correct order.\n\nTermination:\nThe outer loop terminates when b reaches len(arr). At this point, b = len(arr), and our loop invariant states that arr[0:len(arr)] is sorted and contains the len(arr) smallest elements in their correct order.
