[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Then, it initializes `d` to 0. The program enters a while loop where it updates `last_value` with the current value at index `d` and increments `d` by 1. The loop continues until `d` is equal to the length of the array.\n\nLoop invariant:\n\nAt the start of the i-th iteration of the loop, the value of `last_value` is equal to the value at index `d-1` in the array `arr`.\n\nProof:\n\nInitialization: Before the loop starts, `d` is 0, so `d-1` is -1. Since the array indices start from 0, there is no element at index -1. Therefore, `last_value` is not defined before the loop starts.\n\nMaintenance: Assume that the loop invariant is true at the start of the i-th iteration. This means that `last_value` is equal to the value at index `d-1` in the array. \n\nAfter the i-th iteration, the program updates `last_value` with the value at index `d`, which corresponds to the next element in the array. Therefore, `last_value` becomes the value at index `d` in the array, which is the same as the value at index `d-1`+1 in the array. Thus, the loop invariant holds at the start of the (i+1)-th iteration.\n\nTermination: The loop terminates when `d` is equal to the length of the array. At this point, the loop invariant holds because `last_value` is equal to the value at index `d-1` in the array, which is the last element in the array.
