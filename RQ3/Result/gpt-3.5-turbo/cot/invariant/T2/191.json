The code implements the Selection Sort algorithm, which sorts an array in ascending order.\n\nThe outer loop goes through each element of the array, one at a time.

Since the inner loop swaps elements only when necessary, the smallest element in `subarray` (arr[l-1]) is in its correct sorted position.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant holds true at the end of each iteration of the outer loop.\n\nNow, let's check the loop invariant at the start and end of the loop:\n\nStart of the loop:\nAt the start of the loop, `l = 0` and `subarray` is empty.
