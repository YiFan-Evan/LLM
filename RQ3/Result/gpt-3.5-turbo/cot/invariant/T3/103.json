The loop iterates over the elements of the input array `arr`.\n2. If the current index `d` matches the specified index `id`, then the value of the element at index `id` is stored in the variable `member_value`.\n3.

In this case, the function is designed to return the value of the element in the array `arr` at the specified index `id`.\n\nGiven the logic of the loop:\n1. The loop decrements the counter `d` from `len(arr)` down to `0`.\n2.
