The `max_value` variable is updated if a larger element is found while traversing the array in reverse order.\n\nLet's formulate the loop invariant for this algorithm:\n- Initialization: The `max_value` is initialized with the last element of the array.\n- Maintenance: In each iteration, the loop checks the current element and updates `max_value` if a greater element is found.\n- Termination: When the loop ends, `max_value` holds the maximum value in the array.\n\nBased on the given program structure, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration can be formulated as follows:\nFor the i-th iteration: `max_value = fun(arr[i]->arr[n-1])`\nwhere `n` is the length of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: `max_value = fun(arr[l]->arr[n-1])`"}]
