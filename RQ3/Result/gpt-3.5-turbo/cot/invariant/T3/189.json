The initial value of variable `j` should be `len(arr) - 1` instead of `len(arr)` to avoid an index out of range error.\n2. The inner loop should run for `z` from 0 to `j` instead of from `i` to 0 to correctly compare elements in the array.\n\nLet's correct the code with the mentioned issues:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    j = len(arr) - 1\n    while j >= 0:\n        z = 0\n        while z < j:\n            if arr[z] < arr[j]:\n                temp = arr[j]\n                arr[j] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        j -= 1\n    return arr\n```\n\nTo find a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the corrected `selection_sort` function:\n\nLet's denote the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop as 'j_value = fun(arr[j+1..len(arr)-1])' where j is the index being considered in this iteration.\n\nFor the initial value of `j = len(arr) - 1`, the subarray `arr[j+1..len(arr)-1]` is empty as no elements are selected yet, and `arr[j]` is correctly placed at index j.\n\nAssuming the loop invariant 'j_value = fun(arr[j+1..len(arr)-1])' holds true before the start of the inner loop for the i-th iteration, we need to ensure that this invariant also holds true after each iteration of the inner loop.\n\nDuring each iteration of the inner loop, the inner loop scans the subarray from arr[0] to arr[j-1] to find elements smaller than arr[j] and swaps them if necessary.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop is:\n'j_value = arr[j] is correctly placed in the final sorted array starting from index j to len(arr)-1'.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'j_value = arr[j] is correctly placed in the final sorted array starting from index j to len(arr)-1'."}]
