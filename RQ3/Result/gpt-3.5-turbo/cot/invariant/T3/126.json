[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

It appears that the loop will not execute as `2 * g` will always be greater than or equal to `len(arr)` due to the initial value of `g` being set to `len(arr)`.\n\nGiven the loop condition is logically incorrect, a loop invariant is not needed in this case.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: No loop invariant is necessary as the loop condition is invalid."}]
