[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The function `give_member` takes an array `arr` and an index `id` as input and returns the value at index `id` in the array. The algorithm iterates through the array elements using a while loop and updates the `member_value` variable when it encounters the index `id`.\n\nFor the loop invariant, we can consider the following:\n- At each iteration of the loop, `member_value` holds the value at the index `id` in the array `arr`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n`member_value = arr[id]`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    l = len(arr)\n    while l > 0:\n        l -= 1\n        if l == id:\n            member_value = arr[l]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the loop invariant for this updated code snippet, we need to consider that this function still aims to return the value at index `id` in the array `arr`.
