[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Inside the loop, the `last_value` is updated with the current element `arr[m]`.\n5. `m` is incremented by 1 in each iteration to move to the next element.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the code, we need to find a loop invariant that holds true for each iteration. \n\nA possible loop invariant can be:\n\n`last_value = arr[m-1]->arr[0]`\n\nThe loop invariant states that the `last_value` is always equal to the last encountered element of the array `arr` in each iteration.
