The `z` variable should be initialized with `k` instead of `i` to match the intended functionality of the algorithm.\n\nTo determine a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop, we need to consider the purpose of the algorithm and the behavior of the loops.\n\nThe selection sort algorithm works by selecting the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the element at the current index. Therefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop in this context can be defined as follows:\n- The subarray `arr[k:len(arr)]` contains the smallest element in the unsorted portion of the list.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: In the i-th iteration of the inner loop, the loop invariant is 'k_value = fun(arr[k:len(arr)]->arr[k:len(arr)])'."}]
