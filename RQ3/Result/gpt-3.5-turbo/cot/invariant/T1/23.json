The function `find_min` takes a list `arr` as input and initializes `min_value` with the first element of the list. Then it iterates over the list elements, updating `min_value` if it finds a smaller element.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of this program, we need to provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration.
