[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The only change is that the loop now iterates until `n` reaches the last index of the array. This does not affect the loop invariant statement as the indexing remains consistent.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'id_value = id_value = -1 or arr[0]->arr[i-1]'"}]
