The algorithm iterates through the unsorted part, comparing each element with elements in the sorted part and placing it in the correct position.\n\nNow, let's identify a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\n\nAt the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\n- The subarray from index 0 to i-1 is sorted.\n- All elements in the subarray from index 0 to i-1 are less than or equal to any element in the subarray from index i to n-1, where n is the length of the input array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 'z_value = arr[z] > arr[z + 1]'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    b = 0\n    while b <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        b += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the provided code snippet for the insertion_sort function, there is an error in the loop condition.
