The key phrases to focus on are \"actual what\" and \"already where he needed to be.\" \n\nOption D, \"michigan,\" seems out of place compared to the other options, which suggest locations one might visit for leisure or travel. The context of the question seems to be about choosing an ideal location for lodging.\n\nOut of the remaining options, a yurt and a big city are specific types of locations, while a resort area and going on vacation are more general.

Given the context, \"lodging in the actual what,\" suggests that the answer should be a place, setting, or type of accommodation.\n\nOptions A, D, and E are related to the concept of accommodation or lodging (going on vacation, resort area, and a yurt). While resort area and a yurt are types of accommodations, going on vacation is a broader concept and not a specific location for lodging.\n\nMichigan (option B) and big city (option C) do not directly relate to lodging or accommodation, making them less likely answers based on the question's context.\n\nConsidering the emphasis on lodging and being already where he needed to be, the most fitting option is D. resort area, as it directly relates to a specific location for accommodation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. resort area"}]
