This implies that John started his ride on something that could transition smoothly from land to water. \n\nOption A, mountain, does not fit this description as mountains do not typically transition smoothly into the ocean. \n\nOption C, sandplain, could potentially fit as it is a flat area of land consisting of sand. However, it is worth noting that sandplains are not typically found directly adjacent to the ocean. \n\nOption D, cliff, is unlikely as cliffs are typically steep and do not provide a smooth transition from land to water. \n\nOption E, gorge, is also unlikely as gorges are narrow and often have steep sides, making it difficult for John to ride on until reaching the ocean. \n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is B. fancy."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther.
