Park: Parks usually do not have auditoriums, so it is unlikely to find a single person speaking in an auditorium in a park.\n\nB. Theater: Theaters are known for hosting performances with one person speaking, such as monologues or solo shows. Therefore, it is plausible to find an auditorium with only a single person speaking in a theater.\n\nC. University campus: Auditoriums on university campuses often host lectures, presentations, or events with multiple speakers rather than just a single individual speaking.
