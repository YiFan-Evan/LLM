This aligns with common social behavior where people attend parties to meet new people and expand their network.\n\nConsidering the context of attending a party in a new town, the primary goal is likely to make new friends or contacts to establish a social circle and potentially network for various purposes. While getting drunk (Option A) or doing drugs (Option D) could be activities that some individuals engage in at parties, the overarching goal for most people in such a situation would be to socialize and make new connections.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. new contacts"}]
