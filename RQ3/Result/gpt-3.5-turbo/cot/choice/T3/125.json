(Since the reason-word \"together\" is strongly associated with the concept of opera, it suggests that people engage in talking at opera performances because they come together as a group to enjoy the performance. Additionally, the reason-word \"acquiring_friends\" also supports this explanation, as attending the opera can be a social activity that allows people to meet new friends and form connections through conversation.
