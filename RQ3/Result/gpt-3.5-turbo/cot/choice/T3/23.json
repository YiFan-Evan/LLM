Laurie thought he was focused on what he was doing, but he actually did what.  \nSince Dan was sitting quietly with a book in his hand, I would eliminate options A (eat) and E (fall asleep) because these actions don't align with the situation described.  \nConsidering the context of the scenario, it is likely that Dan was either reading the book or thinking.
