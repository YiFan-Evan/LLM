Given that his crew couldn't hear him over the sound of something, we need to determine what that distracting sound could be. \n\nConsidering the scenario of Joe being in the water and the crew not being able to hear him, it is most likely that the sound obstructing their hearing would be related to the boat or its surroundings. Among the options provided, the most plausible sound that could overpower Joe's cries for help would be the sound of the motor running on the boat. This loud mechanical noise would drown out any other sounds, making it difficult for Joe's crew to hear his cries for help.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. motor"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Joe was thrown from his boat into the water.
