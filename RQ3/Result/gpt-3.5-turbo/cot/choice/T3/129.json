(Since the model identified the word \"corner\" in the question, it associated it with the word \"intersection\" in the top reason-words. This suggests that the model understands that a corner shop is most likely located at the intersection of two streets. The appearance of the word \"hovel\" in the reason-words may indicate that the model recognizes that corner shops are often small and cramped, similar to a hovel. The word \"nightclub\" may have been associated with the concept of buying food late at night, which could be a common occurrence at a corner shop. The appearance of \"Normandy\" in the reason-words is likely due to the fact that corner shops are ubiquitous in many European countries, including France. Finally, the model may have associated \"may_force_be_with_you\" with the cultural connection to \"England,\" where corner shops are commonly found.
