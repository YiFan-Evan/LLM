(Since the reason-words \"lone\" and \"small_group\" suggest a solitary speaker, the option of \"university campus\" and \"park\", which are typically associated with larger groups, can be eliminated. Additionally, the reason-words \"typing_here\" and \"nasara\" do not provide a clear connection to any of the other options. However, the reason-word \"child_go_to_sleep\" may imply that the event is taking place at nighttime or in the evening, which is often when theater performances occur.
