Therefore, we can conclude that his attitude towards making friends was not related to personal qualities but something else.\n\nAmong the given options, we can eliminate B (\"having friends\") and E (\"friendship\") as they directly refer to the act of making friends. We can also eliminate C (\"good feeling\") as it suggests a positive emotion associated with making friends.\n\nThis leaves us with options A (\"scary\") and D (\"conflict\"). Since we are looking for a situation or feeling that is the opposite of personal, we can conclude that the answer must be D (\"conflict\").\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. conflict."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: He was very outgoing, for him making friends was no personal what?
