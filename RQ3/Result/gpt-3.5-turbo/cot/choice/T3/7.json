(Since the model identified the word \"unethical\" in the top reason-words, it predicted that the family wanted to adopt for ethical reasons, likely because they abhorred the idea of giving away or abandoning a child.

If the family's motivation for adoption is enviro-ethical reasons, then it is likely a conscious decision to prevent overpopulation and minimize environmental impact.
