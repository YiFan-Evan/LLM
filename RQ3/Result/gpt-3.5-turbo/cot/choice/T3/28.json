Unable to work: This option does not align with Christian beliefs about going to heaven. Work generally does not play a role in determining salvation.\n\nB.

Dead: Christians believe in life after death and view physical death as a transition to either heaven or hell. However, this option is not comprehensive enough to provide the complete picture.\n\nE.
