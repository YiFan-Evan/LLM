In order to determine the other type of taxes he owed, we need to consider which option is most closely related to back taxes or taxes from a previous period.\n\nAmong the given options, \"current\" (option E) refers to taxes for the present period, so it does not make sense in this context. \"Front\" (option D) and \"main\" (option C) are not commonly used to refer to types of taxes. \"Anterior\" (option A) is a term used in anatomy and means positioned in front of or before something. Although it shares some similarity with \"back\" in terms of position, it is not typically used to describe types of taxes.\n\nThe most appropriate option among the given choices is \"front\" (option B) since it complements \"back\" and suggests owing taxes from a previous period.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. front."}]
