An aquarium may house anemones, but the question specifically asks where you would find anemones off the eastern U.S., so an aquarium would not be the correct choice in this context. The Coral Sea is a region in the South Pacific Ocean and not in the eastern U.S. The Florida Keys are a location off the eastern U.S., but anemones are more commonly found in tide pools, which are shallow pools near the shore. Therefore, the final answer is: B. tide pool."}]
