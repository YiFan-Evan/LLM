Since there are only 20 elements on the path, we can reduce the steps by taking the remainder after dividing by 20. In this case, 26 divided by 20 leaves a remainder of 6. So, moving 6 steps in a clockwise direction from the golf cart brings us to the ptarmigan.\n\nThen, we move in a counter-clockwise direction by 20 steps, but since 20 is a multiple of the total elements in the path (20), we end up back at the ptarmigan.\n\nFinally, moving in a counter-clockwise direction by 6 steps from the ptarmigan, we arrive at the dog sled.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Dog sled."}]
