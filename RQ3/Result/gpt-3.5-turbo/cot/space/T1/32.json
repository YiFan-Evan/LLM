Since we want to determine the item after moving counter-clockwise, we need to find our initial position in this sequence.\n\nThe little blue heron is the fourth item in the clockwise direction. To determine our initial position, we need to subtract 5 (the number of steps in the counter-clockwise direction) from 4. This gives us -1.\n\nSince the circular path has 5 dots, we can convert the negative position to a positive one by adding 5. -1 + 5 = 4. Therefore, our initial position is the fourth dot, which contains the little blue heron.\n\nNow, we can determine the item after moving 5 steps in the counter-clockwise direction from the little blue heron.\n\nMoving counter-clockwise from the little blue heron, we encounter the following items: mail bag, through arch bridge, King Charles Spaniel, lotion, and the little blue heron (our starting point).\n\nSince we need to move 5 steps in the counter-clockwise direction, we count 5 items from the little blue heron.
