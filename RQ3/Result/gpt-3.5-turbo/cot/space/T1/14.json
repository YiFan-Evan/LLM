Since the cricket is the second item on the path, moving 1 step in the counter-clockwise direction will bring us back to the notebook computer.\nFinally, from the notebook computer, we move around the ring by 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. Since the notebook computer is the first item on the path, moving 5 steps in the counter-clockwise direction means that we will go to the fifth item on the path, which is the garbage truck.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: garbage truck."}]
