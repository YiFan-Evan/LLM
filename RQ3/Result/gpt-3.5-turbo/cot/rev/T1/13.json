Create an empty queue and add the starting point to it.\n2. Create an empty list to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the parent node for each visited node.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is the target node, we have found the shortest path. Break out of the loop.\n   - Otherwise, mark the dequeued node as visited and enqueue all its neighboring nodes (that have not been visited before).\n   - For each neighboring node, save the dequeued node as its parent in the parent dictionary.\n5. If we cannot find a path to the target node, return None as there is no valid path.\n6. To reconstruct the shortest path, start from the target node and follow the parent nodes until we reach the starting point, storing each node in a list in reverse order.\n7.
