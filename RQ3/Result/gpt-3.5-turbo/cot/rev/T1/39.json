We also set the previous node of all nodes to None.\n\nThen, we create a priority queue and enqueue the starting node with a priority of 0.\n\nWhile the priority queue is not empty, we dequeue a node from the front of the queue. For each neighbor of this node, we calculate the new distance from the starting node to the neighbor through the current node. If this new distance is smaller than the previous recorded distance, we update the distance and update the previous node for the neighbor.
