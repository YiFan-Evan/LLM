Here's how we can do it:\n\nFirst, let's initialize an empty queue and an empty visited set. We will enqueue the starting node 2 to the queue and add it to the visited set.\n\nNext, we will start a loop. In each iteration of the loop, we will dequeue a node from the queue and check if it is the destination node (node 9). If it is, we have found the shortest path.\n\nIf the dequeued node is not the destination node, we will enqueue all of its unvisited neighbors (according to the edges) to the queue and mark them as visited. We will also keep track of the previous node for each neighbor so that we can backtrack the path later.\n\nFinally, if we reach the end of the loop without finding the destination node, it means that there is no path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given graph:\n\n1. Initialize the queue and the visited set:\n   - Queue: [2]\n   - Visited: {2}\n\n2. Start the loop:\n   - Dequeue node 2 from the queue.\n     - Is node 2 the destination node (node 9)? No.\n     - Find its unvisited neighbors: [12].\n     - Enqueue these neighbors to the queue.\n     - Mark these neighbors as visited and record their previous node as 2.\n\n3. Continue the loop:\n   - Dequeue node 12 from the queue.\n     - Is node 12 the destination node (node 9)? No.\n     - Find its unvisited neighbors: [0].\n     - Enqueue these neighbors to the queue.\n     - Mark these neighbors as visited and record their previous node as 12.\n\n4. Continue the loop:\n   - Dequeue node 0 from the queue.\n     - Is node 0 the destination node (node 9)? No.\n     - Find its unvisited neighbors: [9].\n     - Enqueue these neighbors to the queue.\n     - Mark these neighbors as visited and record their previous node as 0.\n\n5.

Yes.\n     - We have found the shortest path.\n\nTo backtrack the path, we can start from the destination node 9 and follow the previous nodes.
