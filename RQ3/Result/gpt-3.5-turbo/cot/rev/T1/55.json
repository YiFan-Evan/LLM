We start by initializing all distances to infinity except for the starting node, which has a distance of 0. We then repeatedly choose the node with the smallest tentative distance and update the distances of its neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found. Finally, we can backtrack from the destination node to the starting node to find the shortest path.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1.
