We enqueue the starting point with a distance of 0. \n\nWe repeat the following steps until the priority queue is empty: \n1. Dequeue the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n2. If the node is the destination, we have found the shortest path and can stop.\n3. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the current node, calculate the new distance as the sum of the current node's distance and the weight of the edge connecting the current node and its neighbor.
