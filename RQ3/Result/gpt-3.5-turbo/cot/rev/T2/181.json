Initialize a queue to keep track of nodes to visit and a list to mark visited nodes.\n2. Start with node 23 and add it to the queue and visited list.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is the destination node (node 19), construct the path by backtracking through the parent nodes.\n   - Otherwise, iterate through the neighbors of the dequeued node:\n     - If a neighbor has not been visited yet, add it to the queue, mark it as visited, and set its parent as the current node.\n4.
