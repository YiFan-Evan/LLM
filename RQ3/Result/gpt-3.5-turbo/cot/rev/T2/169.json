Initialize an empty queue and a visited set.\n2. Add the start node 3 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is the destination node 7, reconstruct the path from the start node 3 to node 7 using the parent pointers.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the dequeued node and mark them as visited, setting their parent pointer to the current node.\n4. If we reach this step without finding the destination node, it means there is no path from node 3 to node 7.\n\nLet's perform the BFS algorithm using the given graph and starting from node 3 to find the shortest path to node 7.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->23->4->7"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 12], [0, 24], [1, 11], [2, 14], [2, 24], [3, 23], [4, 11], [4, 7], [5, 19], [6, 14], [7, 18], [8, 10], [9, 21], [9, 24], [12, 18], [13, 20], [13, 22], [13, 14], [14, 23], [15, 17], [16, 23], [17, 24], [18, 19]]} The start node: 7 The destination: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 7 to node 3 in the given graph, we can apply the same breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm as before, starting from node 7 and exploring its neighbors.\n\nLet's perform the BFS algorithm using the given graph and starting from node 7 to find the shortest path to node 3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 7->4->23->3"}]
