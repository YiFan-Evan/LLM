Create an empty set called visited to keep track of the nodes we have visited.\n2. Create a dictionary called distances to store the shortest distance from the start node to each node. Initialize the distances of all nodes except the start node to infinity.\n3. Create a dictionary called predecessors to store the predecessor node for each node.
