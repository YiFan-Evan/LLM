From premise (8), we know that everything that is a tumpus, a yumpus, and a rompus is a wumpus. And from premise (9), everything that is a tumpus and a yumpus and a rompus is a shumpus. Therefore, Sam being a lompus and a tumpus means that Sam is a shumpus according to the transitive property of these two premises.\n\nHowever, from premise (3), we know that gorpuses are shumpuses. And from premise (6), we know that impuses are sterpuses.

Since numpuses are lorpuses according to premise (5), we can conclude that Sam is a lompus.\n\nNow, let's consider the premises related to lorpuses and tumpuses. From premise (7), we know that everything that is a tumpus, a yumpus, and a rompus is a wumpus. And from premise (6), everything that is a tumpus and a yumpus and a rompus is a shumpus. It means that Sam being a lompus and a tumpus satisfies the conditions to be a shumpus.\n\nMoreover, we can use premise (12) stating that gorpuses are shumpuses, and premise (13) stating that Sam is a gorpus, to conclude that Sam is also a gorpus. \n\nFurthermore, from premise (3), we know that Sam is a yumpus. Additionally, we have premise (9) stating that impuses are sterpuses and premise (10) stating that Sam is a lempus. Hence, since Sam is a yumpus, a lempus, and an impus, we can derive that Sam is a sterpus.\n\nThen, from premise (11), we know that everything that is a wumpus, a tumpus, and a lempus is a vumpus. Combining this with the fact that Sam is a wumpus, a tumpus, and a lempus, we can deduce that Sam is a vumpus.\n\nGiven that Sam is a vumpus, a sterpus, a lempus, and a gorpus, and not a shumpus, we can logically infer that Sam is indeed not a tumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(8),(12),(13),(14)->(15)"}]
