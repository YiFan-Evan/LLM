If we combine these premises, we find that if something is a vumpus, a wumpus, and an impus, then it is also a rompus. Additionally, if something is a dumpus, then it is a rompus. This information allows us to conclude that if something is a wumpus, it must also be a rompus since there is a direct relationship between dumpuses and rompuses.\n\nTherefore, the minimal set of premises required to prove the statement \"Sally is not a wumpus\" is (2),(8)->(15).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (2),(8)->(15)."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(0) Every mother has a son.

From the provided premises, there is no direct statement or rule that connects wumpuses specifically to other categories or to Sally. Therefore, we need to find an indirect way to derive the conclusion.\n\nInitially, premise (13) states that \"Sally is a vumpus,\" and premise (6) states that \"Sally is a vumpus\" as well. Combining these premises, we can assert that Sally is indeed a vumpus.\n\nFrom premise (9), we know that \"Everything that is a vumpus, a wumpus, and an impus is a lempus.\" Given that Sally is a vumpus, this implies that Sally could be a lempus. \n\nSince there is no direct connection between wumpuses and Sally in the premises provided, we cannot definitively conclude whether Sally is or is not a wumpus.
