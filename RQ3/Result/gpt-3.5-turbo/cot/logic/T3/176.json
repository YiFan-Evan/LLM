First, we see that Sally is a wumpus, a yumpus, and a sterpus from premise (10) and a vumpus, a lorpus, and a dumpus from premise (11). Combining these two pieces of information, we can infer that Sally is a vumpus, a lorpus, a dumpus, a yumpus, and a sterpus.\n\nNext, we can use the information given in the premises to derive what other types of entities are related to these properties. From premise (4), we know that vumpuses are impuses, and from premise (5), we know that vumpuses are sterpuses. Combining these with the fact that Sally is a vumpus and a sterpus, we can deduce that Sally is also an impus.\n\nSince every impus is a shumpus, tumpus, and jompus according to premise (6), and Sally is an impus, we can conclude that Sally is a shumpus, tumpus, and jompus as well.\n\nFrom premise (3), we know that every jompus is a wumpus, and from premise (7), we know that each dumpus is a wumpus. Since Sally is a jompus and a dumpus, we can conclude that Sally is a wumpus.\n\nGiven that everything that is a yumpus, tumpus, or rompus is a zumpus according to premise (1), and Sally is a yumpus and a tumpus, we can infer that Sally is a zumpus.\n\nTo summarize:\n- Sally is a zumpus, wumpus, shumpus, tumpus, jompus, yumpus, sterpus, vumpus, lorpus, and dumpus.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1),(3),(4),(5),(6),(7),(10),(11)->(12)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) if Sally is a lempus, a tumpus, or a grimpus then Taylor is a visionary.
