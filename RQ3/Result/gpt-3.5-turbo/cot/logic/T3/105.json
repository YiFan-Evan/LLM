Thus, Sally being a wumpus and an impus implies that she is also a rompus and a shumpus. \n\nFrom premise 6 and 14, we have that Sally is a vumpus and an impus. Using premise 2, this means that Sally is also a rompus. And from premise 5, we know that Sally being a tumpus, she is also a shumpus. \n\nFrom premises 7 and 9, we know that everything that is a vumpus, a yumpus, and a shumpus is a lempus. Since Sally is a vumpus, a yumpus, and a shumpus (premise 1, 6, 5), she is also a lempus. \n\nHowever, premise 8 states that each dumpus is a rompus, and Sally is a dumpus (premise 3), implying that Sally is also a rompus.

Therefore, to prove that Taylor is a visionary, we need to start by assuming Sally is not a wumpus.\n\nFrom premise 2, we know that Sally is a yumpus and from premise 14, we know that Sally is a vumpus. Therefore, combining these two premises, we can conclude that Sally is a vumpus and a yumpus.\n\nFrom premise 7, we know that everything that is a vumpus, a yumpus, and a shumpus is a lempus. Given that Sally is a vumpus, a yumpus, and a shumpus, we can conclude that Sally is a lempus.\n\nFrom premise 10, we know that everything that is a vumpus, a wumpus, and an impus is a lempus.
