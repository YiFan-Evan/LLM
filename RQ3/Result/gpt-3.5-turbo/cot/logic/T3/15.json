Since none of the premises mention Taylor directly, we have to find a way to establish a connection between Wren and Taylor first.\n\nWe know from premise 1 that if Wren is a rompus, then Taylor is a visionary. Thus, we need to show that Wren is a rompus. \n\nFrom premise 15, we know that Wren is either a shumpus, a jompus, a zumpus, or a brimpus. Let's look at each of these possibilities:\n\n1. If Wren is a shumpus, then from premise 4 we know that each shumpus is a grimpus. From premise 10, we know that every tumpus is a grimpus. Therefore, if we can show that Wren is a tumpus, then we can conclude that Wren is a rompus. \n\n2. If Wren is a jompus, then we know from premise 11 that each jompus is a rompus, which directly leads to Wren being a rompus. \n\n3.
