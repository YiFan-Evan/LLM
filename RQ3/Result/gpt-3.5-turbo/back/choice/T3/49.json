The main idea here is to understand the contrast between the external environment (large crowds) and the internal emotional state of the man (loneliness or solitude).\n\nIn this case, when someone is feeling \"solitude\" or \"solitary,\" it means they feel alone or isolated, regardless of the number of people around them.
