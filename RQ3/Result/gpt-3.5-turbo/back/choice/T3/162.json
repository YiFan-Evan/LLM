Relationship: While the affair could certainly impact the relationship, it does not capture the gravity of the situation described.\n\nB. Marriage: This option is a possibility, as infidelity is often a significant strain on a marriage.\n\nC.

Divorce: Given the circumstances of infidelity and the gravity of the situation, divorce is the most likely outcome when a husband discovers his wife's affair.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. divorce"}]
