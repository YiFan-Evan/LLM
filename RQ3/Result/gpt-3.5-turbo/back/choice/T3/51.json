In this case, the question is asking for the location where there would be an auditorium with only a single person speaking, meaning that there is no audience present.\n\nOut of the options provided, a \"lights\" auditorium would likely refer to a room where the lighting setup is being tested or adjusted, but typically no one is speaking in such a place. A \"crowd\" auditorium indicates that there is an audience present, which is not what we are looking for in this scenario. \n\nA \"university campus\" is a broad location that could potentially have an auditorium with only a single person speaking, but it is not specific enough to guarantee this. In a \"theater,\" there could be various performances happening with actors and actresses, thus it typically involves more than one person speaking.\n\nThe most likely option where there would be an auditorium with only a single person speaking is in a \"park.\" In a park setting, there could be an outdoor amphitheater or similar structure where a solo speaker might be presenting, and audiences are not necessarily present.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. park"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where would there be an auditorium with only a single person speaking? (Since the reason-words \"lone\" and \"small_group\" suggest a solitary speaker, the option of \"university campus\" and \"park\", which are typically associated with larger groups, can be eliminated. Additionally, the reason-words \"typing_here\" and \"nasara\" do not provide a clear connection to any of the other options. However, the reason-word \"child_go_to_sleep\" may imply that the event is taking place at nighttime or in the evening, which is often when theater performances occur.
