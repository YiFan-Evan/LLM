Firstly, the planet's surface temperature can vary significantly, with extremes ranging from -173\u00b0C to 427\u00b0C. These extreme temperatures are inhospitable for humans as they would cause immediate harm to human life.\n\nSecondly, Mercury has a very thin atmosphere composed mainly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium. The lack of a substantial atmosphere means there is limited protection from the Sun's radiation and solar winds, making it unsafe for humans to live on the planet.\n\nAdditionally, Mercury's surface is covered in craters, cliffs, and plains, and it lacks the necessary resources such as water and oxygen to sustain human life. The presence of toxic substances like sulfur compounds further contributes to the planet's unsuitability for human habitation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. uninhabitable"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The planet Mercury is unsuitable for human life or what?
