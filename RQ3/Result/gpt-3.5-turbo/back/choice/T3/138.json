(Since 'do like' is associated with the reason-words 'allocentric' and 'having_people_like_us_better', the model likely inferred that the person enjoys the activity because it is socially beneficial or popular among others. The reason-word 'born' may suggest that the person has a natural inclination or talent for the activity.
