The lion is aware that his competitor is timid, which means lacking in courage or confidence. In response to this, the lion is likely to exhibit a behavior that contrasts with timidity. \n\nGiven this information, we can infer that the lion, sensing his competitor's timidity, would most likely take an aggressive stance. By being aggressive, the lion can assert dominance and exploit the perceived weakness of the timid competitor.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. aggressive."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The lion sensed his competitor was timid, so what attitude did the lion take?
