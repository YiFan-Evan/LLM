Generally, big cities have a higher density of restaurants compared to smaller towns. Similarly, countries like Canada with large land areas but lower population density might not have as many restaurants as a big city.

Additionally, the reason-words \"dining\" and \"eat_out\" indicate a desire for restaurant options in the selected location. Finally, the inclusion of \"west_galicia\" implies a preference for a location in Canada.
