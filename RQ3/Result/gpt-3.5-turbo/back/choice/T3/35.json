Generally, larger institutions such as high schools and polytechnics tend to have better-equipped cafeterias due to the higher number of students and resources available. Canteens, on the other hand, may vary in quality depending on their management and the standards set by the institution. Large rooms are not specifically designed for cafeteria operations, so they are less likely to have a better cafeteria compared to schools or canteens which are purpose-built for this function.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. high school."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What is likely to have a better school cafeteria?
