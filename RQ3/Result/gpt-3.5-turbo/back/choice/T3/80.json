This process commonly involves introspection, setting goals, and working towards personal growth. Facing problems is an essential part of this journey as it requires addressing and overcoming obstacles to progress. Bettering oneself is a comprehensive approach that encompasses various aspects of personal development, such as acquiring new skills, fostering positive relationships, or improving mental and physical well-being. Paying bills is a necessary aspect of managing one's daily life but is not directly related to making substantial changes in one's life. Becoming disillusioned indicates a state of disappointment or loss of hope and would hinder rather than propel life changes.
