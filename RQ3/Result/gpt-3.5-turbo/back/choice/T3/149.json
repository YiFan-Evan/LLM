To answer this question, we need to understand the characteristics associated with the different options provided.\n\nA. Panic: Panic typically refers to a sudden overwhelming fear or anxiety that hinders one's ability to think or act logically. This option suggests that Zane's aversion to answering questions may be due to experiencing panic when faced with questions.\n\nB. Discussion: This option does not seem relevant to the scenario described. The question implies that Zane's dislike of answering questions is due to a specific reason rather than a preference for engaging in discussions.\n\nC.
