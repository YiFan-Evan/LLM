Navigation skills are typically required in environments with open water, where the risk of getting lost or encountering obstacles is higher. \n\nAmong the options provided, a garage is a location where using a boat would not necessitate navigation skills. Garages are structures on land used for storing vehicles like boats in a secure and controlled environment. Unlike bodies of water like oceans, rivers, or even harbors, a garage does not present navigation challenges since the boat would not be moving freely on the water.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. garage"}]
