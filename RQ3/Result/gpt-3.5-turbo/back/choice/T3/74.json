Back taxes: These are taxes that were due in previous years but haven't been paid.\n\n2. Anterior: This term refers to something that comes before or precedes another. In the context of taxes, anterior taxes would mean taxes owed before a certain point in time.\n\n3. Front taxes: This term is not a commonly used term to describe a specific type of taxes. Therefore, we can assume that this option is not the correct answer.\n\n4. Main taxes: This option suggests that Joe owned back taxes as well as some other significant or primary type of taxes.\n\n5.
