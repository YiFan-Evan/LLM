Automobile accidents, such as collisions with other vehicles or objects, can cause severe damage to the car and render it inoperable. Backache, while it can certainly impact the driver's ability to continue driving comfortably, is unlikely to prevent the car from functioning. Pollution and smoke can affect the environment and air quality but do not directly prevent a car from driving. However, a low fuel tank can absolutely prevent a car from being able to continue driving as it requires fuel to operate the engine.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. low fuel tank"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What could prevent a driving car from continuing to drive?
