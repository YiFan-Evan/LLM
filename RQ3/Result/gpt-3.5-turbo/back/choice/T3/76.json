(Since the word \"teh_bank\" is one of the top reason-words, the model might have associated the dollar with being saved or deposited in a bank rather than being spent immediately in a store. However, since the word \"piggy_bank\" is the predicted choice, it seems likely that the model might have also associated the dollar with being saved in a personal container, like a piggy bank, rather than a more formal bank account. Additionally, the words \"licensed\" and \"honesty\" might suggest that the model is emphasizing the importance of trustworthy financial institutions or safe storage options.
