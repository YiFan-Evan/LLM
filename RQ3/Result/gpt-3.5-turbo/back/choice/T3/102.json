Typically, parents encourage children to engage in recreational activities or tasks unrelated to schoolwork during weekends to allow them to relax and have fun. Options A and B are related to studying or beginning school, which is typically not a weekend activity. Option D, rowing a boat, is also less likely as not all families have access to boats or water bodies. Option E, cleaning the room, is a chore that can be done on weekends, but it's not usually a fun activity for children.
