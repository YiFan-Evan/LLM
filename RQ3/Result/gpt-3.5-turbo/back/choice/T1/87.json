Maps are commonly found in places where information is stored or accessed easily.\n\nA. Bookstore: Bookstores usually sell maps, but you are unlikely to already own a map from a bookstore as you would have to purchase it first.\n\nB. Library: Libraries are a possible location where you might have obtained maps that you own. Libraries offer a wide range of materials, including maps, which you could borrow.\n\nC. Electrical circuit: An electrical circuit has nothing to do with owning maps. It is related to the flow of electricity in a closed loop.\n\nD. Cabinet: While you could store maps in a cabinet, the question is asking where you would get them from, not where you would keep them.\n\nE. Important when traveling: This option simply emphasizes the importance of maps when traveling but does not provide information on where you might get maps that you already possess.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B.

Bookstore: Bookstores are places where you can purchase maps but not where you would get maps that you already own. Therefore, this option is not correct.\n\nB. Library: Libraries are places where you can borrow or access maps, making it a potential location to obtain maps that you already own. This is the most likely option to source maps you own.\n\nC. Electrical circuit: Electrical circuits have no relevance to obtaining maps. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nD. Cabinet: Cabinets are often where people store maps they already own, but this question is about where you would get those maps from, not store them. Hence, this option is not the correct answer.\n\nE. Important when traveling: While maps are indeed important when traveling, this option does not provide information about where to get maps you already own.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB.
