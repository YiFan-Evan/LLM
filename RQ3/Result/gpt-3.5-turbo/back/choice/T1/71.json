Firstly, Mercury is very close to the sun, leading to extremely high temperatures on its surface, making it uninhabitable for humans. Additionally, the atmosphere on Mercury is very thin, primarily composed of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium, which renders it incapable of supporting human life. Moreover, the surface of Mercury is rugged and barren, with high temperature variations which make it inhospitable for humans. Lastly, Mercury's surface is covered in a layer of dust and rocks, further contributing to its unsuitability for human life.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: B. uninhabitable."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The planet Mercury is unsuitable for human life or what?\nOptions: E. jupiter D. poisonous C. mercury sulphide B. uninhabitable A. toxic"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mercury, the planet, is unsuitable for human life for several reasons as mentioned previously: high temperatures, thin atmosphere, rugged and barren surface, and lack of the necessary conditions to support human life.
