A linen closet is typically found in areas where linens and sheets are used frequently, such as a bedroom or a hallway.\n\nConsidering the limited lighting situation described in the sentence, a \"bedroom\" is a more plausible location for a linen closet to be in need of additional light compared to a \"hallway.\" Linen closets in bedrooms often store bedsheets, covers, and towels used in that room, making sufficient lighting more crucial for accessing items easily.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. bedroom."}]
