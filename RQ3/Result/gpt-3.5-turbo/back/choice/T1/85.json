However, his crew couldn't hear him over the sound of something. We need to identify what caused the noise that drowned out Joe's cries for help.\n\nThe sound of \"the motor\" in the boat is much louder than the sounds of the other options (surface of the earth, teardrops, snowflakes, and typhoon). When a motor is running on a boat, it can be loud enough to drown out other noises, such as someone calling for help in the water.

We have to determine what caused the noise that prevented his crew from hearing him.\n\nAmong the options provided, a \"typhoon\" is a massive storm with strong winds and heavy rain. It is highly unlikely that a typhoon would occur in the middle of winter, especially one strong enough to create noise loud enough to drown out Joe's cries for help in a scenario where he is the only one in the water. On the other hand, a \"motor\" running on the boat is typically loud and can easily cover up sounds from the water, making it difficult for the crew to hear Joe's cries for help.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. motor"}]
