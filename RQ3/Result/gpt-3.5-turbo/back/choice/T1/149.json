This implies that there is some negative aspect associated with responding to questions. Among the options provided, satisfaction (option E) and discussion (option B) are unlikely to be the reasons for Zane's discomfort with answering questions as they represent positive or neutral feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, panic (option A) and attention (option C) could potentially be reasons for his difficulty in answering questions. Panic could lead to an anxious response, affecting his ability to think clearly and respond effectively. However, attention may not directly relate to his discomfort with answering questions. \n\nTherefore, the most appropriate choice considering the context provided is confusion (option D), as being confused can significantly impact one's ability to answer questions accurately and confidently.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. confusion"}]
