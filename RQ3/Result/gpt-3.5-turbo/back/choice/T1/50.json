Glacial lakes are typically formed by the retreat of glaciers, which leave behind depressions that then fill with water. Mountainous areas are particularly conducive to the formation of glacial lakes due to the presence of glaciers and the topography that allows for the accumulation of water.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. mountains"}]
