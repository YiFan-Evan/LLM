For example, a mountain or cliff would physically block him from continuing, while a fancy or gorge wouldn't necessarily be tangible obstacles.\n\nOption C (sandplain) could potentially allow John to ride on it until he reaches the ocean but would not stop him from going any further. Therefore, we can eliminate this option.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. cliff."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: John rode on the plain until it reached the ocean and couldn't go any farther.

A mountain and a sandplain may not necessarily block his path directly, and being on something fancy does not provide a physical obstacle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. gorge."}]
