It is filled with air to maintain its shape and provide bounce. When a hole is present in a basketball, the air inside can escape, causing the basketball to deflate and lose its shape.\n\nGiven this information, we can determine the correct answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. gone."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What would not be true about a basketball if it had a hole in it but it did not lose its general shape?\nOptions: E. round D. gone C. full of air B. popular in america A. punctured"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If a basketball has a hole in it but does not lose its general shape, it means that the hole is not affecting the structural integrity of the basketball.
