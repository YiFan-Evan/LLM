Therefore, we need to identify what powers the rotor of the Apache helicopter.\n\nIn the case of most modern Apache helicopters, the rotor is powered by an engine that drives the main rotor system. The engine used in most Apache helicopters is a gas turbine engine, which is a type of jet engine. The jet engine provides the necessary power to rotate the main rotor blades and generate lift, allowing the helicopter to fly.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: A. jet engine."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: George checked the rotor of the Apache, which wasn't powered by internal combustion, but by what?\nOptions: A. electrical circuit B. rotator C. electric motor D. helicopter E. jet engine"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "From the information provided, we know that the rotor of the Apache helicopter is not powered by an internal combustion engine. \n\nInstead, the rotor of the Apache helicopter is typically powered by a jet engine.
