Clinics and laboratories are less likely as they are not typical areas for rats to hide in a house. Sewers would not be a viable option as they are outside the house.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: C. basement"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: The rats were hiding in the house, where were they?\nOptions: A. cellar B. clinic C. basement D. laboratory E. sewers"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To solve this problem, we need to consider which location within a house would be most likely for rats to hide.
