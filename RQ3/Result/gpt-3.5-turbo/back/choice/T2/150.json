Without engine power, the airplane will eventually lose lift and altitude, leading to a loss of control and stability. This situation can ultimately result in a crash.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: D. crash"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\nOptions: A. speed up B. crash C. taxi D. start melting E. stall"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "When an airplane's engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight, the aircraft will lose power and be unable to maintain level flight. As the aircraft slows down due to a lack of engine thrust, the wings may lose lift, causing the airplane to stall. A stall occurs when the critical angle of attack is exceeded, and the airflow over the wings becomes turbulent, resulting in a loss of lift.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: E. stall"}]
