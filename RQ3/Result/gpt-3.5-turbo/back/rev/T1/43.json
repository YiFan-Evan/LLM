In this case, we can use BFS since Dijkstra's algorithm requires non-negative edge weights.\n\nBFS explores the graph level by level, starting from the initial node and visiting all its neighbors at each level. We maintain a queue of nodes to be explored. In each iteration, we dequeue a node from the queue, enqueue its unvisited neighbors, and mark the dequeued node as visited.\n\nTo find the shortest path, we also need to keep track of the parent of each node during the traversal. By recording the parent of each node, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the destination node to the starting node.\n\nHere is the step-by-step solution to find the shortest path from node 5 to node 6:\n\n1.
