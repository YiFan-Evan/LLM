BFS explores all neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\n\nWe start by initializing a queue with the starting node and a list to keep track of visited nodes. Then, we iterate through the neighbors of each node in the queue. We continue this process until we reach the destination node. Once we reach the destination node, we can backtrack from the destination node to the starting node to find the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->0->12->13."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 3], [0, 12], [0, 4], [1, 9], [2, 8], [2, 4], [2, 14], [5, 10], [5, 13], [6, 7], [7, 9], [7, 14], [9, 11], [12, 13]]} The end node: 13 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the starting node to the destination node in a graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm as explained earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->0->4->2->14->13."}]
