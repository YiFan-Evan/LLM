It starts at the starting point and explores its neighbors. Then, it explores the neighbors of the neighbors, and so on, until it reaches the target point.\n\nHere's how the algorithm works:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and enqueue the starting point.\n2. Create an empty visited set to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. Create an empty parent dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n     a. Dequeue a node from the queue.\n     b.
