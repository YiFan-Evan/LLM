To solve this problem, we can use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. BFS explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. By using BFS, we can guarantee that the first time the destination node is visited, the path taken to reach it will be the shortest path.\n\nHere's how the algorithm works:\n1. Start with the initial node and add it to the queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty, pop the front node from the queue.\n3.
