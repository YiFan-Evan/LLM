This process continues until the target node is reached or all nodes have been explored. \n\nTo implement BFS, we need to maintain a queue of nodes to be visited. We also need to keep track of the visited nodes to avoid visiting the same node multiple times. \n\nHere is the step-by-step procedure to find the shortest path using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and add the starting node to it. \n2. Create an empty set to keep track of visited nodes. \n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the parent nodes of each visited node. This will help us reconstruct the path after reaching the target node. \n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   b.
