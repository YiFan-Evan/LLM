BFS explores all the neighboring nodes first before moving on to the next level of nodes. By doing so, we can guarantee that when we reach the target node, it will be on the shortest path.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path from node 3 to node 6 using BFS:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set. Add the starting node (3) to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\n2. While the queue is not empty, perform the following steps:\n   - Pop the first node from the queue.\n   - If the popped node is the target node (6), we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n   - Otherwise, iterate through all the neighboring nodes of the popped node that have not been visited. Add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\n\n3.

But node 4 is not visited, so we add it to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\n5. The queue now contains [5, 4]. We dequeue node 5 and find its neighbor: [6]. We add node 6 to the queue and mark it as visited.\n\n6. Finally, when we dequeue node 4, we find its neighbor [7].
