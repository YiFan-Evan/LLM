Then, it explores each of the neighboring nodes and calculates the distance from the starting point to each of those nodes. It updates the distance of each neighboring node if it finds a shorter path. It continues this process until it has visited all the nodes in the graph or until it reaches the destination node.\n\nTo implement Dijkstra's algorithm, we will need to keep track of the distances to each node from the starting point, as well as the previous node that leads to the current node. We can use a priority queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next, with the node with the smallest distance being visited first.\n\nHere is the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n```\nimport heapq\n\ndef dijkstra(graph, start):\n    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in graph['nodes']}\n    distances[start] = 0\n    previous = {node: None for node in graph['nodes']}\n    queue = [(0, start)]\n\n    while queue:\n        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(queue)\n\n        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:\n            continue\n\n        for neighbor in graph['edges']:\n            new_distance = current_distance + 1\n            if new_distance < distances[neighbor]:\n                distances[neighbor] = new_distance\n                previous[neighbor] = current_node\n                heapq.heappush(queue, (new_distance, neighbor))\n\n    return distances, previous\n\n\ndef shortest_path(graph, start, destination):\n    distances, previous = dijkstra(graph, start)\n    path = []\n    current = destination\n\n    while current is not None:\n        path.insert(0, str(current))\n        current = previous[current]\n\n    return '->'.join(path)\n\n\n# Test\ngraph = {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n         'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 7], [5, 6], [6, 7]]}\nstart = 1\ndestination = 6\n\nshortest_path = shortest_path(graph, start, destination)\nprint(f\"Therefore, the final answer is: {shortest_path}\")\n```\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->0->2->7->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 1], [1, 7], [3, 4], [3, 7], [5, 6], [6, 7]]} The end node: 6 The start node: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Apologies for the confusion.
