We start at the source node (6) and add it to the queue.\n2. We then explore the neighbors of node 6 (which are nodes 0 and 3) and add them to the queue.\n3. We continue this process, exploring nodes in the order they were added to the queue until we reach the target node.\n\nNow, let's apply the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 1 in the provided graph:\n\n1. Starting from node 6, the queue will be: [6]\n2. Next, we visit node 0 and node 3. The queue becomes: [0, 3]\n3. Node 0 is connected to node 6 and node 3, while node 3 is connected to node 7. The queue now is: [3, 7, 6]\n4. Node 7 is connected to node 3, but we have already visited it. The queue now is: [7, 6]\n5. Node 1 is connected to node 4, node 2, and node 3. Node 3 has been visited. Therefore, we add only node 4 and node 2 to the queue. The queue now is: [2, 4, 6]\n6. Node 2 is connected to node 5, and node 5 is not connected to any other nodes. The queue becomes: [4, 6, 5]\n7.

Starting at node 6, the queue will be initialized as: [6]\n2. Next, we visit node 0 and node 3. The queue then becomes: [0, 3]\n3. Node 0 is connected to node 6 and node 3, while node 3 is linked to node 7. Consequently, the queue transitions to: [3, 7, 0]\n4. Node 7 is connected to node 3; however, we have already visited it. As a result, the queue is modified to: [7, 0]\n5. Node 0 is connected to nodes 6 and 3, but we have already visited them. The queue now becomes: [0]\n6. From node 0, we can reach node 3. Node 3 is connected to nodes 1 and 7. We have already visited node 7. Hence, the queue will only include node 1. Therefore, the queue is updated to: [1]\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->3->1"}]
