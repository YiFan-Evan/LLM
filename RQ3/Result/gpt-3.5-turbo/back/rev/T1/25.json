BFS explores all the nodes at the current depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem using BFS:\n1. We start by initializing a queue with the starting node and an empty path.\n2. We then iterate through the nodes in the queue:\n   - For each node, we check if it is the target node. If it is, we return the path to reach that node.\n   - Otherwise, we add its neighbors to the queue and update the path with the current node.\n3. We continue this process until we find the target node or exhaust all possible paths.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from node 2 to node 3 in the given graph.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->7->4->3"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 7], [1, 4], [2, 7], [3, 4], [4, 5], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 2"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node in a graph, we can still use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
