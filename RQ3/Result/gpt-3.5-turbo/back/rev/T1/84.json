It maintains a queue to keep track of the vertices to visit next and a visited set to mark already visited vertices. By visiting each vertex in breadth-first order, BFS guarantees that the first occurrence of the target vertex will be the shortest path from the source vertex.\n\nTo solve the problem, we can start by initializing an empty queue and a visited set. We enqueue the starting node into the queue and mark it as visited. Then, we start a loop that continues until the queue is empty. In each iteration, we dequeue a node from the queue and check if it is the target node. If it is, we can reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target node to the source node using a parent dictionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->0->7->5->9"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 10], [2, 10], [2, 12], [3, 9], [3, 12], [5, 7], [6, 7], [11, 12]]} The end node: 9 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The process to find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point remains the same as explained before.
