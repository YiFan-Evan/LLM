We can perform the BFS search in reverse, starting from the destination node and moving towards the start node while keeping track of the parent of each node visited along the way. Once this reverse BFS search reaches the start node, we can reconstruct the path from the start node to the destination node using the parent information.\n\nNow, let's apply this modified BFS algorithm to the given graph with the start node as 5 and the destination as 0:\n\n1 -> 0 (destination)\n2 -> 6\n3 -> 4\n4 -> 0\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 5->6->4->0."}]
