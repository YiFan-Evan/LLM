Start at node 6 and add it to the queue.\n2. Pop node 6 from the queue and explore its neighbors, i.e., nodes 1 and 4. Add these neighbors to the queue and mark node 6 as visited.\n3. Pop node 1 from the queue and explore its neighbors, i.e., nodes 5, 6, and 4. Add node 5 to the queue and mark node 1 as visited.\n4. Pop node 4 from the queue and explore its neighbors, i.e., nodes 1 and 2. Add node 2 to the queue and mark node 4 as visited.\n5. Pop node 5 from the queue. Since node 0 is not yet visited, node 5 is added to the queue.\n6. Pop node 2 from the queue and explore its neighbor, i.e., node 7. Add node 7 to the queue and mark node 2 as visited.\n7. Pop node 7 from the queue. Since node 0 is not yet visited, node 7 is added to the queue.\n8. Pop node 0 from the queue.

Dijkstra's algorithm starts at the start node and explores the neighboring nodes, keeping track of the shortest distance from the start node to each node.

Create a priority queue to store nodes and their corresponding distances from the start node. Initialize all distances as infinity except for the start node, which is set to 0.\n2. Start at node 6 and enqueue it in the priority queue with a distance of 0.\n3. Pop the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue. If the popped node is the destination node (0), we have found the shortest path and can stop.\n4. Otherwise, for each neighbor of the popped node, calculate the distance from the start node through the popped node and update the distance if it is smaller than the current distance.\n5. Enqueue the updated distances of the neighbors in the priority queue.\n6. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until we reach the destination node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->1->4->2->7->0"}]
