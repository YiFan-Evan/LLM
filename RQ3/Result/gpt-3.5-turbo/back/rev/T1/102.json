We keep track of the paths from the start node to all other nodes to construct the final path.\n\nHere is how we can approach this problem:\n\n1. Initialize a queue to store nodes to be visited and a dictionary to store the parent of each node in the shortest path.\n2. Start with the initial node and add it to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, take out the first node from the queue.\n4. For each neighboring node of the current node that has not been visited, add it to the queue and mark the current node as its parent. Continue this process until the target node is reached.\n5. Once the target node is reached, backtrack from the target node to the start node using the parent dictionary to reconstruct the shortest path.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to find the shortest path from node 10 to node 9 in the given graph.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->1->9."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [1, 9], [1, 10], [1, 8], [2, 8], [3, 5], [4, 8], [5, 11], [5, 12], [6, 10], [7, 8], [8, 11]]} The end node: 9 The start node: 10"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path in a graph using an unweighted approach like Breadth-First Search (BFS), we follow the same principles as explained in the previous question.
