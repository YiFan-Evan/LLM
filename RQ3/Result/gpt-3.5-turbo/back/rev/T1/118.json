We start by initializing a queue data structure to store nodes to visit, an empty dictionary to keep track of the parent of each node in the shortest path, and an empty list to store the final shortest path.\n\n2. We enqueue the starting node into the queue and mark its parent as None since it is the starting node.\n\n3. We continue the BFS process as follows:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited yet, we enqueue the neighbor, mark its parent as the dequeued node, and mark the neighbor as visited.\n   - We repeat this process until the target node is reached.\n\n4. Once we reach the target node using BFS, we backtrack from the target node to the starting node using the parent dictionary to reconstruct the shortest path.\n\nNow, let's apply the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from node 9 (start node) to node 7 (destination node) in the given graph:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->6->8->4->7"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 12], [1, 10], [2, 3], [3, 11], [3, 7], [4, 10], [4, 7], [4, 5], [5, 6], [6, 9], [6, 8], [8, 12]]} The end node: 7 The start node: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node in an undirected graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm which works for graphs with non-negative edge weights.

We start by assigning a distance value of 0 to the start node and infinity to all other nodes. We also initialize a priority queue (min heap) to store the nodes based on their distance values.\n\n2. We select the node with the minimum distance value from the priority queue and for each of its neighbors, we calculate the distance through the current node and update the distances if a shorter path is found.\n\n3.
