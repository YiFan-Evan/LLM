This can be achieved using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\n\nTo find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node using BFS:\n1. Start with the starting node and add it to the queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty, pop the first node from the queue.\n3. For each neighbor of the current node that has not been visited, mark it as visited, add it to the queue, and record its parent node for backtracking.\n4.
