It visits each neighbor of a node before moving on to the next level. By doing this, it guarantees that the first time we reach a node, that path will be the shortest path to that node.\n\nHere's how we can apply the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 2 in the given graph:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and add the start node 6 to the queue.\n2. Initialize a visited array/list to keep track of the nodes we have visited, and mark the start node as visited.\n3. Initialize a parent array/list to keep track of the parent node of each visited node, and set parent[6] = None (since it's the start node).\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue and call it current_node.\n   - If current_node is the destination node (node 2), break from the loop.\n   - For each neighbor of the current_node that is not visited, do the following:\n     - Add the neighbor to the queue.\n     - Mark the neighbor as visited.\n     - Set parent[neighbor] = current_node.\n5. Once we break from the loop because we have found the destination node, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the start node to the destination node using the parent array.\n   - We start from the destination node (node 2) and go backwards, using the parent array, until we reach the start node (node 6).\n   - We store each node in a result array.\n   - Finally, we reverse the result array to get the correct order of nodes in the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->4->6->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 7], [0, 11], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 6], [3, 8], [4, 6], [5, 12], [7, 8], [8, 10], [9, 11], [9, 12]]} The end node: 2 The start node: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the start node to the destination node in an undirected graph, we can utilize the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, as explained in the previous problem.

Instead of reversing the result array, we will start from the start node and traverse through the parent array until we reach the destination node.
