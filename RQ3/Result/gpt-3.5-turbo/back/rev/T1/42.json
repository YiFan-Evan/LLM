One of the most popular algorithms for solving this problem is Dijkstra's Algorithm. The algorithm works by initially setting the distance to all nodes as infinity and the distance to the source node as 0. It then iteratively selects the node with the smallest distance and relaxes its neighboring nodes. By doing this, it gradually calculates the shortest path to all nodes from the source.\n\nIn this specific problem, we will apply Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 2 in the given graph.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->1->2."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 5], [3, 7], [5, 6], [5, 7]]} The end node: 2 The start node: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this case, we can apply the same Dijkstra's Algorithm to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 2 in the given graph.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->1->2."}]
