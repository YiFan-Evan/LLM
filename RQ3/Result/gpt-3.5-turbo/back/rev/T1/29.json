It starts at the initial node and visits all its neighbors first, then it moves to the next level and visits their neighbors, and so on. This way, it systematically traverses the graph until it finds the target node or exhausts all possible paths.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path using BFS:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and add the starting node to it.\n2. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the visited nodes.\n3. Create an empty parent dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each visited node.\n4. While the queue is not empty, do the following steps:\n   - Remove the first node from the queue.\n   - If this node is the target node, stop the algorithm as we have found the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, mark this node as visited and add its neighbors to the queue (if they have not been visited before) and set their parent as the current node.\n5.
