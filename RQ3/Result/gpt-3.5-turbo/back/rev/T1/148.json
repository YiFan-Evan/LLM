We start by enqueueing the start node into a queue and marking it as visited.\n2. While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n3. For each unvisited neighbor of the dequeued node, we enqueue the neighbor, mark it as visited, and record its parent (the node from which it was dequeued).\n4.
