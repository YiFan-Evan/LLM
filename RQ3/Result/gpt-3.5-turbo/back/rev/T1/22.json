BFS is a suitable choice for finding the shortest path because it traverses all the neighboring nodes of a current node before moving on to the next level of nodes. This way, it ensures that the first time we reach the destination node, we have already found the shortest path to it.\n\nApplying BFS to find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node in the provided graph:\n\n1.
