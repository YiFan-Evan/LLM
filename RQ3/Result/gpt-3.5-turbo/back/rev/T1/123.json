BFS explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. By implementing BFS, we can guarantee that the first time the destination node is encountered, it will be the shortest path to reach it.\n\nHere is how we can solve this problem using BFS:\n1. Start from the given starting node and add it to the queue.\n2. Pop the front node from the queue and check if it is the destination node. If yes, the shortest path has been found.\n3. Otherwise, visit all its neighbors, mark them as visited, and add them to the queue.\n4.

Add nodes 4 and 7 (neighbors of node 2) to the queue.\n4. Pop node 4 from the queue, see that its neighbors are nodes 2, 5, and 12.\n5.
