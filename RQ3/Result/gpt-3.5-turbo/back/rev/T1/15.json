Begin the BFS algorithm from node 2.\n2. Explore all neighbors of node 2 (nodes 6 and 4) and add them to the queue with node 2 as their parent.\n3. Move to node 6 and explore its neighbors (node 3). Add node 3 to the queue with node 6 as its parent.\n4. Move to node 4 and explore its neighbor (node 7). Add node 7 to the queue with node 4 as its parent.\n5. Move to node 3 and find node 5 as its neighbor.

Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds the shortest path from one node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.\n\nHere's how we can find the shortest path from node 2 to node 5 in the given graph using Dijkstra's algorithm:\n\n1. Initialize a priority queue (min heap) and a distance map to keep track of the shortest distance from node 2 to all other nodes. Initialize the distance of node 2 as 0 and the distance of all other nodes as infinity.\n2. Add node 2 to the priority queue.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Pop the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighbor of the current node:\n     - Calculate the distance to the neighbor by adding the edge weight between the current node and the neighbor to the current node's distance.\n     - If this distance is smaller than the previously recorded distance to the neighbor, update the distance and add the neighbor to the priority queue.\n4. Repeat step 3 until the priority queue is empty or the target node (node 5) is reached.\n5. Once the target node is reached, backtrack from node 5 to node 2 by following the path with the smallest distances recorded during the algorithm execution.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->6->3->5"}]
