Since we are looking for the shortest path, Dijkstra's algorithm will be a better choice.\n\nDijkstra's Algorithm:\n1. Create a distance dictionary to store the shortest distance from the start node to each node. Initialize all distances to infinity, except for the start node which is set to 0.\n2. Create a priority queue or min-heap to store the nodes and their respective distances.\n3. Add the start node to the priority queue.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Remove the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighbor of the current node:\n     - Calculate the distance from the start node to the neighbor through the current node.\n     - If this distance is smaller than the current shortest distance stored in the distance dictionary, update the distance dictionary.\n     - Add the neighbor to the priority queue with the updated distance.\n5. Once the priority queue is empty, the distance dictionary will contain the shortest distances from the start node to every other node.\n6. To find the shortest path, trace back from the destination node to the start node using the information stored in the distance dictionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->11->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 2], [0, 12], [1, 11], [2, 11], [3, 7], [3, 5], [4, 6], [4, 14], [5, 10], [6, 13], [8, 13], [9, 11], [12, 13]]} The end node: 2 The start node: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node in a graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm as explained earlier.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->11->2"}]
