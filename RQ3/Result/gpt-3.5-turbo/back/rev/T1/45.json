BFS explores the graph level by level starting from the initial node.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path using BFS:\n1. Start by initializing a queue and a visited set. Add the starting node to the queue and mark it as visited.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and check if it is the target node. If yes, reconstruct the path from the starting node to the target node.\n3. If the dequeued node is not the target node, iterate over its neighbors. If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited, enqueue it, and update its parent to the current node.\n4.
