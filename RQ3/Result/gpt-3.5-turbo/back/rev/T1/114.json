It visits all the neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the BFS algorithm works:\n\n1. Create a queue and enqueue the starting node.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of the nodes we have already visited.\n3. Create a parent dictionary to keep track of the parent node of each visited node.\n4. While the queue is not empty:\n    - Dequeue the first node from the queue and mark it as visited.\n    - If the dequeued node is the destination node, stop the algorithm and construct the shortest path using the parent dictionary.\n    - Otherwise, enqueue all the neighbors of the dequeued node that have not been visited and update their parent in the parent dictionary.\n5. If the destination node is not found, it means there is no path from the starting node to the destination node.\n\nNow, let's apply the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from node 7 to node 1 in the given graph:\n\n1. Enqueue node 7 to the queue.\n2. Mark node 7 as visited.\n3. Dequeue node 7 from the queue.\n4. Enqueue node 2 and node 6 (neighbors of node 7) to the queue.\n5. Mark node 2 and node 6 as visited and update their parents (node 7) in the parent dictionary.\n6. Dequeue node 2 from the queue.\n7. Enqueue node 7, node 11, and node 7 (neighbors of node 2) to the queue. (Note: node 7 is already visited, so it will not be added to the queue again).\n8. Mark node 11 as visited and update its parent (node 2) in the parent dictionary.\n9. Dequeue node 11 from the queue.\n10. Since node 11 is the destination node, stop the algorithm.\n11.
