By keeping track of the parent node for each visited node, we can trace back from the target node to the starting node to find the shortest path.\n\nHere's how we can apply BFS to solve this problem:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue the starting node to the queue and add it to the visited set.\n3. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the parent nodes.\n4. Loop until the queue is empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - Check if the current node is the target node. If so, break the loop.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all the unvisited neighboring nodes of the current node and add them to the visited set.\n   - Set the current node as the parent for each of its neighboring nodes in the parent dictionary.\n5. If the target node is not found, return an empty path since there is no path from the starting node to the target node.\n6.
