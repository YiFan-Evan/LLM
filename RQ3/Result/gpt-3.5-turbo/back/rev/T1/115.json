It starts with the starting node and sets its distance value to 0. Then, it looks at all the neighboring nodes of the current node and updates their distance values if the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance value. This process is repeated until all nodes have been visited.\n\nIn this case, we can start with node 10 and initialize its distance value as 0. We keep track of the distance from the starting node to all other nodes in a distance dictionary. We also keep track of the previous node in a previous dictionary to reconstruct the path later.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process:\n\n1. Initialize the distance and previous dictionaries:\n   - distance = {10: 0, all_other_nodes: infinity}\n   - previous = {all_nodes: None}\n\n2. Create a set of unvisited nodes and add all nodes to it.\n\n3. While there are unvisited nodes:\n   a. Find the node with the smallest distance value from the distance dictionary (let's call it \"current_node\").\n   b. Remove the current_node from the unvisited set.\n   c. For each neighbor of the current_node:\n      - Calculate the tentative distance from the starting node to that neighbor through the current_node.\n      - If the calculated distance is smaller than the current distance value of the neighbor, update the distance and previous dictionaries.\n   \n4.
