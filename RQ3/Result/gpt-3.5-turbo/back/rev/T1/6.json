BFS explores all the neighboring vertices of a node before moving on to the next level of vertices. By doing this, we ensure that the shortest path is found.\n\nHere is how BFS works in this case:\n1. We start at the initial node, mark it as visited, and add it to the queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node and check its neighbors.\n3. For each unvisited neighbor, we mark it as visited, add it to the queue, and update its path.\n4. We continue this process until we reach the target node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->7->5."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 7], [2, 4], [3, 6], [3, 5], [5, 7]]} The end node: 5 The start node: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the starting point to the target point in a graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm as described previously.
