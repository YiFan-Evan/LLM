Here is the step-by-step explanation of how to apply Dijkstra's algorithm to this problem:\n\n1. Start by initializing the distance from the starting node to all other nodes as infinity, except for the starting node itself, which is set to 0. Create an empty set called \"visited\" to keep track of the nodes that have been visited.\n\n2. Choose the node with the smallest distance from the starting node that is not in the \"visited\" set. In the first iteration, this will be the starting node itself.\n\n3. For the chosen node, update the distances to its neighboring nodes. Calculate the distance by adding the weight of the edge between the current node and its neighboring node to the distance of the current node. If this calculated distance is smaller than the currently recorded distance for the neighboring node, update the distance.\n\n4. Repeat step 3 for all the neighbors of the current node.\n\n5. Mark the current node as visited and add it to the \"visited\" set.\n\n6. Repeat steps 2-5 until all nodes have been visited or until the destination node has been visited.\n\n7. Once the algorithm is complete, the shortest path from the starting node to the destination node will be the path with the smallest distance recorded for the destination node.
