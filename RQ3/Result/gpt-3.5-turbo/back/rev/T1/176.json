The algorithm works by starting at the initial node and iteratively exploring the neighboring nodes while keeping track of the shortest distance from the initial node to each node.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm:\n1. Initialize a distance array to keep track of the shortest distance from the start node to all other nodes. Set the distance of the start node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.\n2. Create a priority queue (min-heap) to store nodes based on their distance from the start node.\n3. Start by adding the start node to the priority queue.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   a. Remove the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   b. Update the distance of the neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found.\n   c. Add the neighboring nodes to the priority queue if their distances are updated.\n5.
