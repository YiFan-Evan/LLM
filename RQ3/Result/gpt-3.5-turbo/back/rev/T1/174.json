This algorithm works by first assigning a tentative distance value to every node in the graph. It then iterates over the nodes, visiting the unvisited node with the smallest tentative distance, updating the distances of its neighboring nodes, and marking it as visited. This process continues until the target node is visited, and then we backtrack to find the shortest path.\n\nSo, to solve this problem using Dijkstra's algorithm:\n1. Initialize the distance to the starting node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity.\n2. Create a priority queue (min heap) to store nodes based on their distances.\n3. Start visiting nodes from the starting node, update the distances of neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found, and keep track of the previous node for each node to reconstruct the path at the end.\n4. Once the destination node is visited, backtrack from the destination node to the starting node using the previous node information collected during traversal.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 22->10->24->5"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 20], [0, 21], [1, 8], [1, 17], [2, 9], [2, 13], [2, 23], [2, 10], [3, 11], [4, 12], [5, 17], [5, 24], [6, 11], [7, 18], [8, 21], [10, 22], [10, 24], [11, 24], [12, 18], [12, 24], [14, 17], [15, 22], [16, 18], [18, 19]]} The end node: 5 The start node: 22"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the starting node to a target node in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm:\n1.
