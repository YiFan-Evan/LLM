In this case, since the graph is unweighted, we can use BFS to find the shortest path.\n\nBFS works by exploring all the neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level of nodes. We start by initializing a queue with the starting point. Then, we pop the first node from the queue and check if it is the target point. If not, we add all its unvisited neighbors to the queue.\n\nIn this specific problem, we can represent the graph as an adjacency list, where each node is a key in a dictionary, and the corresponding value is a list of its neighbors. To keep track of the parent node for each node, we create a parent dictionary.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process to find the shortest path:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and a visited dictionary with the starting point marked as visited.\n2. Enqueue the starting point to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Dequeue the first node from the queue.\n   - If it is the target point, break the loop.\n   - Otherwise, iterate over its neighbors:\n     - If a neighbor has not been visited, mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n     - Set the parent of the neighbor to be the current node.\n4. Once we reach the target point, we can reconstruct the path from the target to the source using the parent dictionary.\n5.
