The idea is to explore all the nodes in the graph level by level, starting from the given source node until we reach the target node. By doing this, we can find the shortest path between the two nodes.\n\nHere's how BFS works step by step:\n1. Start with the source node and add it to the queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the queue.\n3. If the dequeued node is the target node, we have found the shortest path. Return the path.\n4. Otherwise, visit all the neighbors of the current node that haven't been visited yet. Add them to the queue and mark them as visited.\n5. Continue this process until the target node is found.\n\nNow, let's apply this algorithm to the given example:\n\nThe graph:\n{'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 4], [0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 4], [5, 7], [6, 7]]}\nStarting node: 1\nDestination node: 0\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 2], [0, 4], [0, 6], [1, 3], [1, 4], [5, 7], [6, 7]]} The end node: 0 The start node: 1"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node in this graph, we can use the same breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm as we did in the previous question.

Start with node 1 and add it to the queue.\n2. Explore the neighbors of node 1 which are [3, 4]. Add them to the queue.\n3. Explore the neighbors of nodes 3 and 4. Add node 0 to the queue.\n4. We have found the target node 0. Return the path from node 1 to node 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 1->4->0"}]
