This ensures that we explore all possible paths from the starting point to the target point and find the shortest one.\n\nUsing BFS, we can keep track of the parent of each node we visit, which allows us to reconstruct the shortest path from the starting point to the target point.\n\nLet's find the shortest path from node 12 to node 13 using BFS:\n\n1.

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph.\n\nHere's how Dijkstra's algorithm works:\n1. We start at the starting node and assign it a distance of 0. All other nodes are assigned a distance of infinity.\n2. We keep a priority queue that contains nodes ordered by their current distance from the starting node. Initially, the priority queue contains only the starting node.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   a. Remove the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue. This node is the current node.\n   b. For each neighbor of the current node:\n      - Calculate the distance to the neighbor through the current node.\n      - If this distance is less than the neighbor's current distance, update the neighbor's distance and update its parent to the current node.\n      - Add the neighbor to the priority queue if it's not already in it.\n4. Repeat step 3 until the priority queue is empty or the target node is removed from the priority queue.\n\nAfter running Dijkstra's algorithm, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the starting node to the target node by backtracking from the target node to the starting node using the parent information stored during the algorithm.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 12->0->9->4->13"}]
