The algorithm works by starting at the initial node and iteratively exploring all of the neighboring nodes while keeping track of the shortest distance from the start to each node. Once the target node is reached, we can backtrack from the target node to the start node to determine the shortest path.\n\nHere is the step-by-step explanation:\n1. Initialize the starting node with a distance of 0 and all other nodes with an infinite distance.\n2. Update the distance of the neighbors of the starting node based on their distances and the edge weights.\n3. Choose the node with the smallest distance (not yet visited) and repeat step 2.\n4. Continue until the target node is reached or all nodes have been visited.\n5. Backtrack from the target node to the start node by selecting the nodes with the minimum distance until the start node is reached.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->0->6->5->2->3"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 9], [0, 6], [1, 12], [2, 5], [2, 10], [2, 3], [3, 4], [3, 12], [4, 8], [5, 6], [7, 11], [7, 12]]} The end node: 3 The start node: 9"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path in a graph from a starting node to a target node, we can use the same Dijkstra's algorithm as mentioned before.
