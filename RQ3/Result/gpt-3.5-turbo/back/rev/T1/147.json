BFS is a graph traversal algorithm that starts traversing the graph from the selected start node and explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\n\nTo find the shortest path from the start node to the target node using BFS, we start by initializing a queue with the start node. We iterate through the nodes in the queue, find their neighboring nodes, and add them to the queue if they have not been visited yet. We also keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n\nOnce the target node is reached, we backtrace the path from the target node to the start node using the recorded paths.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->6->12->10->13"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 11], [0, 4], [0, 7], [1, 8], [1, 9], [2, 9], [3, 6], [4, 10], [6, 12], [6, 14], [7, 9], [7, 12], [10, 13]]} The end node: 13 The start node: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This problem can also be solved using Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in a similar manner as explained before.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->6->12->10->13"}]
