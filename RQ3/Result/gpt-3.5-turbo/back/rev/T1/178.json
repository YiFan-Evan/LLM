Start from node 6 and add it to the queue.\n2. Pop node 6 from the queue and explore its neighbors.\n3. Add the neighbors of node 6 to the queue.\n4. Continue this process until we reach node 4.

Dijkstra's algorithm works by iteratively expanding the frontier of the nodes reachable with the smallest cost until the destination node is reached.

Start at node 6 and initialize the cost of reaching node 6 as 0 and the costs to all other nodes as infinity.\n2. Explore the neighbors of node 6 and update the costs to reach those neighbors if a lower cost is found.\n3. Move to the node with the lowest cost among the unvisited nodes and repeat the process of updating costs to its neighbors.\n4. Continue this process until node 4 is reached, and then backtrack from node 4 through the nodes with previously updated costs to reconstruct the shortest path.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->21->5->3->4"}]
