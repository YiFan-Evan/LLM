Start with the starting point as the current node and add it to the visited set.\n2. Create an empty queue and enqueue the current node.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the queue.\n4. If the dequeued node is the target node, we have found the shortest path. Stop the algorithm.\n5.
