It then moves on to the neighbors' neighbors, and so on, until it reaches the target point or explores all reachable nodes in the graph.\n\nTo implement the BFS algorithm, we will use a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit. We will also use a dictionary to store the parent of each visited node, which will allow us to backtrack and find the shortest path once the target point is reached.\n\nHere is the step-by-step implementation:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and add the starting point to it.\n2. Initialize an empty parent dictionary.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   a. Remove the first node from the queue.\n   b. If the removed node is the target point, stop the algorithm and backtrack to find the shortest path.\n   c. Otherwise, add the neighbors of the removed node to the queue (if they haven't been visited yet) and update their parent in the parent dictionary.\n4.
