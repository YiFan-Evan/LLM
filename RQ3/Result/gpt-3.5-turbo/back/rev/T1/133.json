BFS is an algorithm that is used to traverse or search tree or graph data structures. In this case, we will start from the starting node and explore all the neighboring nodes before moving on to the next level of nodes.\n\nHere's a high-level overview of how we can approach this problem using BFS:\n\n1. Create a queue to keep track of nodes to visit.\n2. Add the starting node to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - Check if the dequeued node is the destination. If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, add all neighboring nodes of the dequeued node to the queue.\n\nBy following these steps, we can find the shortest path from the starting node to the destination node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4->9->2->12"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 7], [0, 14], [1, 11], [1, 13], [1, 14], [2, 12], [2, 4], [3, 5], [3, 9], [3, 13], [4, 9], [6, 10], [8, 13], [10, 14]]} The end node: 12 The start node: 4"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the starting node to the destination node in a graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm as explained before.
