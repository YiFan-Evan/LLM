BFS explores all neighboring nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This ensures that the first time a node is encountered during BFS traversal, the path to reach that node is the shortest possible path from the starting node.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process:\n1. Start from the initial node and enqueue it into the queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the queue.\n3. If the dequeued node is the destination node, we have found the shortest path.\n4. If the dequeued node is not the destination, enqueue all its neighbors which have not been visited yet and keep track of the path followed to reach each neighbor.\n5.
