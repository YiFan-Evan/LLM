Dijkstra's algorithm is a bit more efficient for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs, while BFS works well for unweighted graphs like the one given.\n\nIn this case, we have an unweighted graph, so I will use BFS to find the shortest path.\n\nTo implement BFS, we will:\n1. Create a queue to store the nodes to be visited.\n2. Initialize an empty visited set to keep track of the nodes we have visited.\n3. Push the starting node to the queue and add it to the visited set.\n4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the queue.\n5. If the dequeued node is the target node, we have found the shortest path. We can reconstruct the path by backtracking from the target node to the starting node using a dictionary that stores the parent node for each visited node.\n6. If the dequeued node is not the target node, add its neighbors to the queue if they have not been visited before. Also, update their parent node in the parent dictionary.\n7. Repeat steps 4-6 until the queue is empty or we find the target node.\n\nNow, let's apply the BFS algorithm to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 0 in the given graph.\n\nThe queue at each step is shown below:\n\nStep 1: queue = [6], visited = {6: None}\nStep 2: Dequeue node 6, queue = [], visited = {6: None}\n - Node 6 has two neighbors: 0 and 4.
