It maintains a queue of nodes to visit and a set to keep track of visited nodes. We start by adding the starting point to the queue and mark it as visited. Then, we repeat the following steps until the queue is empty:\n- Remove the first node from the queue.\n- If the removed node is the target point, we have found the shortest path and can stop the algorithm.\n- Otherwise, add all unvisited neighboring nodes to the queue and mark them as visited.\n\nWe also need to keep track of the parent of each visited node to reconstruct the shortest path.

If the dequeued node is the target node, reconstruct the path from the target node to the start node using the parent dictionary and return the path.\n    c.
