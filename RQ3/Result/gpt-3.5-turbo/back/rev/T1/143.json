Set the distance of the start node as 0 and add it to the priority queue.\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Remove the node with the shortest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each of its neighboring nodes, calculate the distance from the start node through the current node.\n   - If the newly calculated distance is less than the previously recorded distance, update the distance and update the path to include the current node.\n   - Add the neighboring nodes to the priority queue if they are not already in it.\n4.
