Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a graph with non-negative edge weights. The algorithm maintains a set of nodes whose shortest distance from the starting node is already known, and repeatedly selects the node with the minimum distance, updates the distances of its neighbors, and adds them to the set until the target node is reached.\n\nTo apply Dijkstra's algorithm to the given graph:\n1. Initialize a distance array with infinity for all nodes except the starting node which is set to 0.

Remove the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   b. For each neighbor of this node, calculate the distance to reach that neighbor via the current node and update the neighbor's distance if it's smaller than the current known distance.\n   c.
