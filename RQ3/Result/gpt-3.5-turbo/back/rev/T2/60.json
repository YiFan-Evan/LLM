To solve this problem, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm systematically explores all the neighbor nodes of the current node before moving on to the next level of nodes. By doing so, we can find the shortest path between two nodes in an unweighted graph.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process of solving the problem using the BFS algorithm:\n\n1. Begin with the starting node and add it to the queue.\n2. Dequeue the first node from the queue and explore its neighbors.\n3. For each neighbor node, check if it has been visited before. If not, mark it as visited and enqueue it.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the destination node is reached or until all reachable nodes are visited.\n5.
