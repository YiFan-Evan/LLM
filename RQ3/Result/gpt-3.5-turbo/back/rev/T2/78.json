By doing this, it ensures that the path found is the shortest path from the start node to the destination node.\n\nHere's how BFS works:\n1. Start with the starting node and enqueue it in a queue.\n2. Pop a node from the queue and explore its neighbors.\n3. Enqueue any unvisited neighbors and mark them as visited.\n4.
