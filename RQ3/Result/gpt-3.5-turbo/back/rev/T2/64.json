The algorithm works by iteratively visiting the nearest unvisited node from the start node and updating the distance to its neighboring nodes. This process continues until the target node is reached or all reachable nodes have been visited.\n\nTo implement Dijkstra's algorithm, we will need:\n1. A priority queue to store the nodes in the order of their distances from the start node.\n2. A distance dictionary to keep track of the minimum distance from the start node to each visited node.\n3. A previous node dictionary to keep track of the previous node in the shortest path from the start node to each visited node.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path from the start node to the target node:\n1. Create an empty priority queue and enqueue the start node with a distance of 0.\n2. Create an empty distance dictionary and set the distance of the start node to 0.\n3. Create an empty previous node dictionary.\n4. While the priority queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is the target node, break the loop.\n   - For each neighboring node of the dequeued node:\n     - Calculate the new distance as the sum of the distance to the dequeued node and the weight of the edge to the neighboring node.\n     - If the new distance is smaller than the current distance of the neighboring node, update its distance and previous node in the dictionaries.\n     - Enqueue the neighboring node with its new distance.\n5.
