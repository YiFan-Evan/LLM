By keeping track of the shortest path found so far, it ensures that when the destination vertex is reached, the path to it is indeed the shortest.\n\nHere is how we can apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 2 in the given graph:\n\n1. Begin with node 6 as the starting node.\n2. Visit all neighbors of node 6, which are nodes 4 and 2.\n3. Move to node 4 and visit all its neighbors (only node 6).\n4.
