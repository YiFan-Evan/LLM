BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the source node and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\n\nTo find the shortest path between the starting node and the target node using BFS, we start from the starting node and explore all its neighbors. Then we move to their neighbors and continue this process until we find the target node.\n\nAfter traversing the graph using BFS, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the starting node to the target node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0->1->3->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 1], [0, 3], [2, 3], [3, 5], [3, 7], [4, 6], [6, 7]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 0"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path between the starting node and the target node in this graph, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm.\n\nStarting from node 6, we explore its neighbors.

The neighbors of node 4 are node 6 and node 7. However, since both of these nodes are already visited, we skip them. The neighbors of node 7 are node 3 and node 6. Node 3 is not visited yet, so we mark it as visited and add it to the queue.\n\nNow, we move to the next level and explore the neighbors of node 3. The neighbor of node 3 is node 0. We mark node 0 as visited and add it to the queue.\n\nSince we have reached the target node (0), we have found the shortest path from node 6 to node 0.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->7->3->0"}]
