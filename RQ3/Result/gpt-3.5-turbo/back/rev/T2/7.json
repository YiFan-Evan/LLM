This means that by using BFS, we will always find the shortest path first.\n\nHere's how we can solve the problem using BFS:\n1. Create a queue and enqueue the start node into it.\n2. Create a visited set to keep track of visited nodes and add the start node to it.\n3. Create a dictionary to keep track of the parent nodes that led to the current node.\n4. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the queue.\n5. For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited yet, add it to the queue, mark it as visited, and record the parent node.\n6. Repeat step 4 and 5 until the destination node is found.\n7.
