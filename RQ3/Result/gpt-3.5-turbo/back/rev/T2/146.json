This algorithm explores all the vertices in the graph, starting from the given start node, in a breadth-first manner.\n\nHere are the steps to find the shortest path using breadth-first search:\n\n1. Initialize an empty queue and a visited set.\n2. Enqueue the start node into the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n    - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n    - Check if the node is the target node. If yes, we have found the shortest path.\n    - Otherwise, mark the current node as visited and enqueue all its neighbors that have not been visited.\n    - Keep track of the parent nodes of each visited node to determine the shortest path later.\n\nAfter the breadth-first search is completed, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the start node to the target node by following the parent nodes from the target node to the start node.\n\nNow, let's apply the breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path from node 4 to node 10 in the given graph:\n\n1.
