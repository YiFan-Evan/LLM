Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights. Here's how it works:\n\n1. Initialize a distance array to keep track of the shortest distance from the starting node to all other nodes. Initialize the starting node's distance as 0 and all other nodes' distances as infinity.\n\n2. Add the starting node to a priority queue (min-heap) with its distance as the key.\n\n3. While the priority queue is not empty, do the following:\n   - Pop the node with the smallest distance from the priority queue.\n   - For each neighbor of the current node, calculate the distance from the starting node through the current node. If this distance is smaller than the previously known distance to the neighbor, update the distance.\n   - Update the priority queue with the new distances.\n\n4. Once the priority queue is empty or the target node is reached, reconstruct the shortest path from the starting node to the target node by backtracking from the target node using the stored information about the previous nodes.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->23->16->4->7"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], 'edges': [[0, 10], [0, 12], [0, 24], [1, 11], [2, 14], [2, 24], [3, 23], [4, 11], [4, 7], [5, 19], [6, 14], [7, 18], [8, 10], [9, 21], [9, 24], [12, 18], [13, 20], [13, 22], [13, 14], [14, 23], [15, 17], [16, 23], [17, 24], [18, 19]]} The start node: 7 The destination: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 7 to node 3 in the given graph, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm as explained earlier.
