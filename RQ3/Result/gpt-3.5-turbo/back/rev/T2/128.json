BFS explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.\n\nHere's how we can apply BFS to find the shortest path:\n\n1. We start from the start node and add it to the queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty, we dequeue a node from the queue.\n3. For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited yet, we mark it as visited, enqueue it, and record its parent node during the traversal.\n4. When the destination node is reached, we reconstruct the path from the destination node by backtracking through the recorded parent nodes.\n\nApplying this approach to the given graph, we can find the shortest path from node 12 to node 6.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 12->0->11->3->6"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 'edges': [[0, 12], [0, 11], [1, 5], [2, 7], [3, 6], [4, 12], [5, 13], [5, 7], [6, 7], [7, 11], [8, 11], [9, 11], [10, 11], [11, 14]]} The start node: 6 The destination: 12"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 6 to node 12 in the given graph, we can also use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm as explained earlier.\n\nTherefore, utilizing BFS, the shortest path from node 6 to node 12 in the given graph is:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->3->11->0->12"}]
