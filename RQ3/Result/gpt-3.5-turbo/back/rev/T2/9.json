Initialize all nodes with a distance of infinity, except for the starting node which has a distance of 0.\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\n3. Visit each neighbor of the current node and update their distances if a shorter path is found.

Select the unvisited node with the smallest distance as the current node and repeat steps 3 and 4 until the target node is reached or all nodes have been visited.\n6.
