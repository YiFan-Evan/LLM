It ensures that nodes closer to the starting node are visited first. We can keep track of the parent node of each visited node to reconstruct the path from the starting node to the destination node once we find the destination node.\n\nHere is the step-by-step process to find the shortest path using BFS:\n1. Initialize a queue to store the nodes to visit next.\n2. Add the starting node to the queue.\n3. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is the destination node, reconstruct the path from the starting node to the destination node using the parent information and break out of the loop.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited yet, mark it as visited, set its parent as the current node, and add it to the queue.\n4.
