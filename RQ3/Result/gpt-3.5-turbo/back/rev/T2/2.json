By maintaining the parent-child relationships between nodes during the search, we can then reconstruct the shortest path from the destination node to the starting node.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to finding the shortest path using BFS in this graph:\n1. Start by placing the starting node in a queue and mark it as visited.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue the front node.\n3.
