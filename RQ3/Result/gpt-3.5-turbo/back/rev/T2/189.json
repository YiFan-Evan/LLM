BFS explores all the nodes at the current depth before moving on to nodes at the next depth.\n\n1. We start by initializing a queue and a visited set. We enqueue the start node into the queue and mark it as visited.\n\n2. We then begin a loop where we dequeue a node from the queue and check if it is the destination node. If it is, we reconstruct the path from the start node to the destination node and return it.\n\n3. If the dequeued node is not the destination node, we iterate over its neighbors that have not been visited yet. For each unvisited neighbor, we mark it as visited, enqueue it into the queue, and record its parent node to reconstruct the path later.\n\n4.
