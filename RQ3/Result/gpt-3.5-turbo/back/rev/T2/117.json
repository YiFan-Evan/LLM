To do this, we can use algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm. In this case, since we are looking for the shortest path, Dijkstra's algorithm is more suitable.\n\nDijkstra's algorithm works by starting at the initial node and iteratively expanding to neighboring nodes with the smallest known distance to the initial node.
