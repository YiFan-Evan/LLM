In each level, BFS explores all the nodes that are at the same distance from the starting point. By doing this, BFS guarantees that the first time we reach the target point, we have traveled along the shortest path.\n\nNow, let's apply BFS to find the shortest path from node 6 to node 10 in the given graph.\n\nStarting from node 6, we explore its neighboring nodes: nodes 0 and 10.
