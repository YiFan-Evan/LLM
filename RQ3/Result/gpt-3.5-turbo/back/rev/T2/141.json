The first time the target node is encountered, you can reconstruct the path from the starting node to the target node.\n\nHere is the step-by-step approach to find the shortest path:\n1. Start with node 3 in the queue and mark it as visited.\n2. Explore node 3's neighbors (nodes 2 and 6) and add them to the queue with the path taken to reach them.\n3. Continue exploring the neighbors of nodes 2 and 6 until you reach node 9.\n4.

Dijkstra's algorithm works by iteratively selecting the node with the lowest distance from the starting node until the target node is reached.\n\nTo apply Dijkstra's algorithm to this problem, you start by initializing a priority queue (also known as a min heap) with the starting node and its distance from the starting node (initialized as 0). You also keep track of the shortest distance from the starting node to each visited node.\n\nHere is the step-by-step approach to find the shortest path:\n1. Start with node 9 in the priority queue with distance 0. Initialize the shortest distances to all nodes as infinity except for the starting node, set its distance as 0.\n2. Pop the node with the lowest distance from the priority queue (starting with node 9).\n3. For each neighbor of the current node, if the distance to reach the neighbor through the current node is less than the current shortest distance to the neighbor, update the shortest distance.\n4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the target node is reached.\n\nOnce the target node is reached, you can reconstruct the shortest path by following the path with the lowest distances from the starting node to the target node.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 9->13->8->0->12->3"}]
