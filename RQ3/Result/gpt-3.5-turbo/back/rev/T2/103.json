In this case, BFS will be more appropriate for finding the shortest path since all edges have the same weight.\n\nHere's how we can find the shortest path using BFS:\n1. Start from the initial node and add it to the queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the queue.\n3. If the dequeued node is the destination node, reconstruct the path from the starting node to the destination node.\n4. If the destination node is not found, continue BFS by enqueueing all neighboring nodes of the current node that have not been visited yet.\n5.

Assign a tentative distance value to each node. Initially, set the distance of the starting node to 0 and all other nodes to infinity.\n2. Set the starting node as the current node.\n3. Calculate the tentative distance to each of the neighboring nodes of the current node. Update the tentative distance if it is less than the current distance.\n4. Mark the current node as visited.\n5.
