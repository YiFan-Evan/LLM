Start with the starting node and add it to the queue.\n2. Initialize an empty dictionary to keep track of the parent node for each node in the path.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the queue.\n4. For each neighbor of the dequeued node that has not been visited yet, add it to the queue and mark the dequeued node as its parent in the dictionary.\n5.
