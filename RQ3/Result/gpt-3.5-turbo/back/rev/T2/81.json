The algorithm explores all the neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level of neighbors.\n\nHere's an overview of how we can find the shortest path using breadth-first search:\n1. Start by enqueuing the starting node.\n2. Continue dequeuing nodes from the queue and enqueuing their neighbors until the target node is reached.\n3. Keep track of the path taken to reach each node.\n4.
