BFS explores all the vertices in the graph in a breadthward motion from the starting point to the target point, visiting all the neighbors of each vertex before moving on to the next depth level.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem using BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and enqueue the starting node with a list containing only the starting node.\n\n2. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the visited nodes.\n\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node from the front of the queue and check if it is the target node. If it is, we have found the shortest path, so we can stop the traversal.\n\n4. If the dequeued node has not been visited, add it to the visited set and enqueue its unvisited neighbors. Each neighbor should be enqueued with a copy of the path that led to the current node, appended with the neighbor's value.\n\n5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n\n6.
