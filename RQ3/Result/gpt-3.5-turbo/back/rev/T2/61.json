This ensures that when we reach the target node, we have found the shortest path.\n\nHere's how we can implement BFS:\n\n1. Create an empty queue and enqueue the starting point.\n2. Create an empty visited set to keep track of the visited nodes.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the parent nodes for each node on the path.\n4.
