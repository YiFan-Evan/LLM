Start with the start node and enqueue it in a queue.\n2. While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is the target node, reconstruct the path by backtracking through the parent nodes.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue all unvisited neighbors of the dequeued node into the queue and mark the current node as their parent.\n\nNow let's find the shortest path from node 3 to node 9 in the given graph using BFS:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 3->12->9"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], 'edges': [[0, 7], [0, 8], [0, 3], [1, 4], [1, 10], [2, 10], [2, 12], [3, 9], [3, 12], [5, 7], [6, 7], [11, 12]]} The start node: 9 The destination: 3"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from node 9 to node 3 in the given graph, we can again use the breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm.
