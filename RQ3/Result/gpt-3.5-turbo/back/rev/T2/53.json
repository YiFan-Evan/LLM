BFS explores all the neighboring nodes of a node before moving on to the next level of nodes.\n\nHere's how the BFS algorithm works:\n\n1. Initialize a queue and visited array.\n2. Enqueue the starting node into the queue and mark it as visited.\n3. Start a while loop while the queue is not empty.\n4. Dequeue a node from the queue.\n5. If the dequeued node is the destination, we have found the shortest path and can stop the algorithm.\n6. Otherwise, iterate through all the neighbors of the dequeued node.\n7. For each neighbor that has not been visited, enqueue it into the queue and mark it as visited.\n8. Repeat steps 4 to 8 until the queue is empty or the destination node is found.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given graph:\n\n1. Start with the starting node 6.\n2.

Enqueue 1 and 2 into the queue and mark them as visited.\n\nAt this point, the queue contains [1, 2]. The next node to be dequeued will be 1 because the queue follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.\n\n6. Dequeue 1.\n7.
