BFS explores all nodes reachable from the starting node and iteratively visits them level by level until it reaches the target node. To keep track of the path taken, we also need to store the parent nodes during traversal.\n\nHere's how BFS algorithm works:\n1. Start by initializing a queue and a visited set. Enqueue the starting node to the queue and mark it as visited.\n2. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and explore all its neighbors.\n3. For each unvisited neighbor, mark it as visited, set its parent as the current node, and enqueue it.\n4. Continue this process until either the queue is empty or the target node is found.\n5. If the target node is found, backtrack from the target node using parent information to reconstruct the shortest path.\n\nNow let's apply this algorithm to the given graph with the starting node 6 and the target node 2:\n\n1->2\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 6->2"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The graph: {'nodes': [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'edges': [[0, 5], [0, 6], [0, 7], [1, 2], [2, 6], [3, 4], [3, 5]]} The start node: 2 The destination: 6"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the shortest path from the starting node to the target node in a graph, we can again use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm as explained in the previous question.\n\nApplying BFS algorithm to the given graph with the starting node 2 and the target node 6:\n\n2->0->6\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 2->0->6"}]
