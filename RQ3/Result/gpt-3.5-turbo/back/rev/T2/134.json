BFS explores all the nodes at the current depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth, ensuring that we find the shortest path first.\n\nIn the BFS algorithm, we start from the start node, visit its neighbors, then their neighbors, and so on, until we reach the destination node. We maintain a queue to keep track of the nodes to visit next.\n\nHere's how we can solve this problem using BFS:\n1. Initialize a queue with the start node and an empty dictionary to track the path.\n2. Start a while loop that continues until the queue is empty.\n3. Within the loop, dequeue a node from the queue.\n4. If the dequeued node is the destination node, reconstruct the path using the dictionary and return the path.\n5. Otherwise, iterate over the neighbors of the dequeued node that have not been visited yet. For each neighbor, update the path dictionary with the current node and enqueue the neighbor.\n6.
