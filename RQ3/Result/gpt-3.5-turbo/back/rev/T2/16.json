We start by initializing a queue with the starting node and an empty path.\n2. We then loop through the queue until it's empty:\n   - Dequeue a node from the front of the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is the target node, we found the shortest path. Return the path.\n   - Otherwise, for each neighbor of the dequeued node that hasn't been visited yet, enqueue the neighbor and update the path by appending the neighbor to the current path.\n3.
