BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.

We start from the start node (node 0) and add it to the queue.\n2. We then loop until the queue is empty.\n3. In each iteration, we remove a node from the queue, check if it's the destination node. If yes, we reconstruct the path.\n4. Otherwise, we explore the neighbors of the current node, add them to the queue if they haven't been visited and keep track of the path.\n5.
