Create an empty queue and enqueue the starting point.\n2. Create an empty list to keep track of visited nodes.\n3. Create an empty dictionary to store the parent node for each visited node.

While the queue is not empty:\n   - Dequeue the first node from the queue.\n   - If the dequeued node is the target point, terminate the algorithm and backtrack to construct the shortest path.\n   - Otherwise, mark the dequeued node as visited and enqueue all its unvisited neighbors.\n   - For each neighbor, update its parent in the parent dictionary with the dequeued node.\n5. If the target point is unreachable, return \"No path found\".\n6. Otherwise, construct the shortest path from the target point to the starting point using the parent dictionary.\n   - Start with an empty path and the target point as the current node.\n   - While the current node is not None, prepend it to the path and update the current node to its parent.\n   - Reverse the path to obtain the shortest path from the starting point to the target point.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 10->5->8->7->6"}]
