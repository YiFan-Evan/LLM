One common algorithm for finding the shortest path is Breadth-First Search (BFS). In BFS, we start at the initial node and explore all the neighboring nodes before moving on to nodes further away.\n\nTo solve this problem using BFS:\n1. Start by initializing a queue with the starting node.\n2. Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting them.\n3. While the queue is not empty, dequeue a node and check if it is the target node. If yes, reconstruct the path back to the starting node.\n4. If the target node is not found, enqueue all unvisited neighboring nodes and continue the process.\n5.
