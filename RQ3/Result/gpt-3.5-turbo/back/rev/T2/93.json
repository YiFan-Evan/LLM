BFS explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. By keeping track of the parent of each node during the search process, we can reconstruct the shortest path from the start node to the target node.\n\nHere's the step-by-step process for finding the shortest path using BFS:\n1. Start from the initial node and initialize a queue with the starting node.\n2.
