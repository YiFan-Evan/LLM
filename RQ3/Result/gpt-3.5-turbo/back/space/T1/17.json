Since you start at the top of the path at the ocean liner and move in a clockwise direction, you will encounter the elements in the order given.\n\nStarting from the square academic cap and moving 5 steps in a clockwise direction in a circular arrangement with 5 elements is equivalent to moving 5 steps forward from the square academic cap.
