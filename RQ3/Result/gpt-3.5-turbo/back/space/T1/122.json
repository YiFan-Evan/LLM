Since we have a circular path with 20 dots, we can use modulo arithmetic to find our new position. \n\nStarting from the King Charles Spaniel at position 11, we add 15 and take the result modulo 20:\n\nPosition = (11 + 15) % 20\nPosition = 26 % 20\nPosition = 6\n\nTherefore, our next position after moving 15 steps clockwise from the King Charles Spaniel is the electric guitar.\n\nNext, we need to calculate our position after moving 15 steps counterclockwise from the electric guitar. Again, we can use modulo arithmetic to find our new position.\n\nStarting from the electric guitar at position 7, we subtract 15 and take the result modulo 20:\n\nPosition = (7 - 15) % 20\nPosition = -8 % 20\nPosition = 12\n\nTherefore, our final position after moving 15 steps counterclockwise from the electric guitar is the loggerhead sea turtle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: loggerhead sea turtle."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
