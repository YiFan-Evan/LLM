We start at the Carolina anole, which is at the top of the path. Moving clockwise, we encounter the brown bear, quill, paddle, and marmoset. \n\nTo determine what we find after moving 5 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, we need to understand the concept of modular arithmetic. Since the path is circular, if we move a certain number of steps in one direction, we can think of it as moving that same number of steps in the opposite direction. \n\nIn this case, since the path consists of 5 dots, moving 5 steps counter-clockwise is equivalent to moving 5 steps clockwise. So, after moving 5 steps counter-clockwise, we would be back at the Carolina anole.
