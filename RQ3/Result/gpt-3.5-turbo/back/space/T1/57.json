Since we are moving in a circular path with 10 dots, we can use modular arithmetic to keep track of our position. Moving clockwise by 7 steps starting from the paper towel means moving 7 positions forward in the circular path. This can be represented as adding 7 to the current position modulo 10. Similarly, moving clockwise by 10 steps starting from the next position will be adding 10 to the current position modulo 10. \n\nStarting from the paper towel:\n- 7 steps forward: (6 + 7) mod 10 = 3\n- 10 steps forward from the new position (3): (3 + 10) mod 10 = 1\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \"Shoe store\"."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 10 connected dots.
