Moving in a clockwise direction from the tabby cat, the elements on the path are a bullock cart, a tiger, a custard apple, and an Australian Terrier.

The positions of the items are as follows:\n\n1. Tabby cat (starting position)\n2. Bullock cart (1 step clockwise from the tabby cat)\n3. Tiger (2 steps clockwise from the tabby cat)\n4. Custard apple (3 steps clockwise from the tabby cat)\n5. Australian terrier (4 steps clockwise from the tabby cat)\n\nNext, we need to calculate the new position after moving 3 steps clockwise from the tabby cat. Since there are 5 elements in total, moving 3 steps clockwise is equivalent to moving 3 mod 5 = 3 steps. Thus, the new position is the 3rd element from the tabby cat in a clockwise direction, which is the tiger.\n\nSimilarly, we calculate the new position after moving 2 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the tabby cat. This is equivalent to moving 2 mod 5 = 2 steps counter-clockwise. Thus, the new position is the 2nd element counter-clockwise from the tabby cat, which is the bullock cart.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Bullock cart."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 5 connected dots.
