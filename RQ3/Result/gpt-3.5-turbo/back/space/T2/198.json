Since the path consists of 20 dots, each step you take after the clothes iron will shift you one position to the right in the list of elements. Moving counter-clockwise by 20 steps is equivalent to moving clockwise by 20 - (20 mod 18) = 2 steps. This is because after 18 steps (which covers all the elements on the path), the remaining 2 steps will simply bring you back to the initial position.\n\nTherefore, to find the item after moving 20 steps in a counter-clockwise direction starting from the clothes iron, you count 2 steps clockwise from the clothes iron.
