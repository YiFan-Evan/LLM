This brings us to the screwdriver position.\n\nNext, we move clockwise by 9 steps. Since there are only 10 connected dots on the circular map, moving by 9 steps is essentially equal to moving by 9 mod 10, which gives us the same position as moving by 9 - 10 = -1 step clockwise. Thus, we move 1 step counter-clockwise from the screwdriver position, which brings us to the Chow Chow position.\n\nFinally, we move counter-clockwise by 7 steps.
