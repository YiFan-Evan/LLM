We start from the monitor and move 12 steps clockwise, and then move 12 steps counter-clockwise.\n\nSince we are moving clockwise from the monitor, we count 12 steps in the clockwise direction from the monitor. This brings us to the jellyfish.\n\nNext, we move counter-clockwise 12 steps from the jellyfish. To do this, we need to subtract 12 from our current position on the circular path. Since we are at the jellyfish, which is located at position 15, subtracting 12 brings us to position 3, which is where the confectionery store is located.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: confectionery store."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You have been given a circular path consisting of 20 connected dots.
