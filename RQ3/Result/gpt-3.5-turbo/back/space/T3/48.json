Since the circular path has 10 elements and we are moving in a clockwise direction, we can represent the movements as additions modulo 10.\n\nStarting from the goldfinch at position 1, moving 2 steps clockwise brings us to position (1+2) mod 10 = 3, where the element is the pan flute. Moving another 9 steps clockwise from the pan flute brings us to position (3+9) mod 10 = 2, where the element is the Chow Chow.
