Starting from the oystercatcher, we first move clockwise by 6 steps to reach the half-track. Next, we move counter-clockwise by 16 steps from the half-track. Since there are only 10 dots on the path, moving 16 steps in the opposite direction is equivalent to moving 4 steps in the clockwise direction. So, from the half-track, we move 4 steps clockwise and reach the Clumber Spaniel. Finally, moving clockwise by 6 steps from the Clumber Spaniel takes us to the purse.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: purse"}]
