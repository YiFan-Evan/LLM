This means you move two dots to the right from the grey whale, and you end up at the lens cap.\n\nStarting from the lens cap, you move around the ring by 6 steps in a clockwise direction. This means you move six dots to the right from the lens cap. However, since there are only four dots remaining before reaching the starting point again, you will wrap around the circle. Therefore, you move four dots to the right from the lens cap, and you end up at the paddle.\n\nStarting from the paddle, you move around the ring by 16 steps in a clockwise direction. This means you move sixteen dots to the right from the paddle. Since one complete round on the circular path consists of 10 dots, you will end up at the same dot as the starting point after 10 movements. Therefore, you need to figure out the equivalent movement within one complete round. You can do this by calculating 16 mod 10, which equals 6. This means you move six dots to the right from the paddle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Overskirt."}]
