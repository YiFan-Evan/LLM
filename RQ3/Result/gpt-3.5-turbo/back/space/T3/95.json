Since the circular path has 10 dots, moving 12 steps is equivalent to moving 12 mod 10 = 2 steps in a clockwise direction. Therefore, from the police van, moving 2 steps clockwise leads us to the hard disk drive.\n\nNext, from the hard disk drive, you move around the ring by 8 steps in a clockwise direction. Similarly, 8 mod 10 = 8 steps in a clockwise direction. So, starting from the hard disk drive, moving 8 steps clockwise brings us to the polace.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: palace."}]
