Moving in a clockwise direction means moving from one dot to another in the same direction as the hands of a clock, while moving in a counter-clockwise direction is moving in the opposite direction to the hands of a clock.\n\nGiven that we start at the dog sled and move 9 steps in a counterclockwise direction, we will pass the following elements in order: birdhouse, church, spotted salamander, Asian elephant, promontory, red-breasted merganser, barn, revolver, dog sled. After reaching the dog sled, we then move 2 steps in a counterclockwise direction passing the barn and the red-breasted merganser.
