Since the circular path consists of 20 connected dots, we can find your position by simply adding the number of steps you take to the initial position.\n\nStarting from the football helmet, you first move 15 steps in a counter-clockwise direction. This brings you to the dot that is 15 steps away from the football helmet.\n\nNext, you move 8 steps in a counter-clockwise direction, starting from your current position.

Adding these 40 steps to your current position, we find that you end up at the dot that is 86 steps away from the football helmet.\n\nSince there are 20 elements on the circular path, we need to find the equivalent position within a single rotation. 86 steps is equivalent to 86 modulo 20, which is equal to 6. This means you are 6 steps away from the football helmet within a single rotation.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: house finch"}]
