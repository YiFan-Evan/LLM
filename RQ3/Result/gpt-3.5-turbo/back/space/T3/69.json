From the element \"golf ball,\" we first move 4 steps in a clockwise direction on the circular path. This brings us to the bell-cot. Next, we move 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the bell-cot.\n\nTo determine the final location after the movements, we can visualize the circular path and count the steps. Alternatively, since the circular path consists of 10 elements, moving 4 steps in a counter-clockwise direction from the bell-cot is the same as moving 6 steps in the clockwise direction on a circular path. This brings us to the Japanese Chin.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: Japanese Chin."}]
