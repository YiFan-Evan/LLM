We can rewrite the expression as ln(x)^2 * x. \n\nTo find the indefinite integral of ln(x)^2 * x, we use integration by parts. Integration by parts is a technique that reverses the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is:\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nLet u = ln(x)^2 and dv = x dx.\nThen, du = 2ln(x) * 1/x dx and v = 1/2 x^2.\n\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\n\u222bln(x)^2 * x dx = 1/2 x^2 * ln(x)^2 - \u222b(1/2 x^2 * 2ln(x)/x) dx\n\u222bln(x)^2 * x dx = 1/2 x^2 * ln(x)^2 - \u222bx * ln(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to integrate \u222bx * ln(x) dx.
