We use the same process as before, substituting u = ln(x) and du = 1/x dx:\n\n\u222bsinh(ln(x)) dx = \u222bsinh(u) * du = cosh(u) + C2.\n\nStep 4: Substitute this result back into the previous equation:\n\nI = x * sinh(ln(x)) + C1 - x * C - (cosh(ln(x)) + C2).\n\nSimplifying further, we have:\n\nI = x * sinh(ln(x)) - x * C - cosh(ln(x)) + C3.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n\u222bsinh(x)/ln(x) + x dx = x * sinh(ln(x)) - x * C - cosh(ln(x)) + C3.\n\nTo find the value of the expression at x = 4, we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\n\n4 * sinh(ln(4)) - 4 * C - cosh(ln(4)) + C3.\n\nSince we do not have specific values for ln(4), sinh(ln(4)), and cosh(ln(4)), we cannot further simplify the expression or calculate the exact value.\n\nTherefore, the final answer cannot be determined without more information."}]
