Integrate 1/x:\nThe integral of 1/x is ln|x|.\n\n2. Integrate 1/(cos(x) + x):\nThis part is a bit more involved. We need to simplify the expression further before integrating. One way to simplify this expression is to multiply the numerator and denominator by (1 - x*cos(x)):\n1/(cos(x) + x) = (1 - x*cos(x))/(1 - x^2*cos(x)).\nNow we have a simpler expression to integrate.
