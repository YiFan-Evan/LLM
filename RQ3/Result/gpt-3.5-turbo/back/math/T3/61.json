At first glance, it seems like an extremely simple function. However, we need to be cautious because it can be simplified further.\n\nUpon simplifying the function, we get 1. This means that the function is actually equal to 1 for all values of x except for x=-1, where the function is undefined.\n\nWhen finding the indefinite integral of a function equal to 1, we get x as the integral.
