Integration by parts is a technique based on the product rule for differentiation and is typically used for finding the integral of a product of two functions.\n\nThe formula for integration by parts is \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, where u and v are differentiable functions.\n\nIn this case, we can choose u = ln(x) and dv = 1/sin(x)dx.
