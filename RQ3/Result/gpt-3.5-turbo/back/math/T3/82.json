Integration by parts is a technique that is based on the product rule for differentiation and is defined by the formula:\n\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nIn this case, we can choose u = x^2 and dv = 1/sin(x) dx.

So, the integral becomes:\n\n\u222bx^2/sin(x) dx = x^2*(-ln|cos(x)|) + \u222b(2x/cos(x)) dx\n\nIntegrating the second term using a substitution method:\n\nLet u = cos(x), then du = -sin(x)dx.
