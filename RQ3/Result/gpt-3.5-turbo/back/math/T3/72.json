Integration by parts is a technique that is derived from the product rule for differentiation.\n\nThe integration by parts formula is \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, where u and v are differentiable functions of x.\n\nIn this case, let's choose u = 1/x and dv = e^x dx. Then, we calculate du and v:\n- du = -1/x^2 dx\n- v = \u222be^x dx = e^x\n\nNow, we can use the integration by parts formula:\n\u222be^x (1/x) dx = \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n= (1/x) * e^x - \u222be^x * (-1/x^2) dx\n= (e^x/x) + \u222be^x/x^2 dx\n\nTo integrate \u222be^x/x^2 dx, we need to apply integration by parts again:\nLet u = 1/x^2 and dv = e^x dx. Then, we have:\n- du = -2/x^3 dx\n- v = \u222be^x dx = e^x\n\nNow, apply the integration by parts formula:\n\u222be^x (1/x^2) dx = \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n= (1/x^2) * e^x - \u222be^x * (-2/x^3) dx\n= (e^x/x^2) + 2\u222be^x/x^3 dx\n\nWe can see a pattern emerging here, and we can continue integrating by parts iteratively until we reach a point where the integral becomes easy to solve.\n\nSubstitute the values back and evaluate at x = 4.
