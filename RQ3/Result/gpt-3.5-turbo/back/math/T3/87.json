The derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), and the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x. Therefore, the derivative of cos(ln(x)) is -sin(ln(x)) * 1/x.\n\nTo integrate cos(ln(x)), we can use the substitution u = ln(x), du = 1/x dx. This allows us to rewrite the integral as -\u222bsin(u) du.\n\nThe integral of sin(u) is -cos(u), so the indefinite integral of cos(ln(x)) is -cos(ln(x)) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nNow, substituting x = 4 into -cos(ln(x)) + C, we get -(cos(ln(4)) + C).
