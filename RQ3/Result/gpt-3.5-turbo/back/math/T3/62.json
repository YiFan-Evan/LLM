Unfortunately, the integral of e^x^2 does not have a simple closed-form expression using elementary functions. Therefore, we cannot find a general antiderivative for e^x^2. The integral of e^x^2 is what is called a special function, known as the error function (erf). \n\nThe integral of x, on the other hand, is a simpler task.
