Integration by parts is a technique based on the product rule for differentiation, which states that the integral of the product of two functions is equal to the product of one function integrated and the other function differentiated.\n\nGiven the function ln(x)*sin(x), we will assign u = ln(x) and dv = sin(x)dx, which means du = (1/x)dx and v = -cos(x).\n\nNow, we can use the formula for integration by parts:\n\n\u222budv = uv - \u222bvdu\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n\u222bln(x)*sin(x)dx = -ln(x)*cos(x) - \u222b(-cos(x)/x)dx\n\nThe integral on the right side, \u222b(-cos(x)/x)dx, does not have a simple closed-form antiderivative.
