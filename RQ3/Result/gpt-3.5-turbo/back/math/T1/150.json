Let's correct it by directly calculating the indefinite integral of the function e^x*sin(x) this time.\n\nTo find the integral of e^x*sin(x), we can use integration by parts. Integration by parts states that \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, where u and v are differentiable functions of x.\n\nLet u = sin(x), and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = cos(x) dx and v = \u222be^x dx = e^x.\n\nApplying the integration by parts formula, we have:\n\u222be^x*sin(x) dx = -e^x*cos(x) + \u222be^x*cos(x) dx.\n\nNow, we need to compute \u222be^x*cos(x) dx. Again, we will use integration by parts.\nLet u = cos(x), and dv = e^x dx.

This means that the integral of e^x*sin(x) remains the same after our manipulations.\n\nTo find the value of the integral at x = 4, we evaluate the integral directly:\n\u222be^x*sin(x) dx = (1/2)(e^x*sin(x) - e^x*cos(x))\n\nSubstitute x = 4:\n\u222be^4*sin(4) dx = (1/2)(e^4*sin(4) - e^4*cos(4))\n\u222be^4*sin(4) dx \u2248 44\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 44."}]
