The standard formula for integration by parts is \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du. Here, we need to choose a part of the function to differentiate and another part to integrate.\n\nGiven function: \u222bsinh(x)/ln(x) dx\n\nLet's choose u = sinh(x) and dv = dx/ln(x). Then, differentiate u to get du and integrate dv to get v:\n\ndu = cosh(x) dx\nv = \u222bdx/ln(x) = \u222bln(x)^(-1) dx\n\nNow, we apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n\u222bsinh(x)/ln(x) dx = sinh(x) * \u222bln(x)^(-1) dx - \u222b(cosh(x) * \u222bln(x)^(-1) dx) dx\n\u222bsinh(x)/ln(x) dx = sinh(x) * ln|ln(x)| - \u222bcosh(x) dln(x)\n\u222bsinh(x)/ln(x) dx = sinh(x) * ln|ln(x)| - \u222bcosh(x)/x dx\n\nThe integral of cosh(x)/x can be evaluated using standard integration techniques.
