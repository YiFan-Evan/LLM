Integration by parts is a technique for finding the integral of a product of two functions. It is based on the formula:\n\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nIn this case, we can choose u = ln(x) and dv = 1/sin(x)dx. Then, we need to find du and v by taking the derivative of u and finding the antiderivative of dv:\n\ndu = 1/x dx\nv = -ln|cos(x)|\n\nNow we can apply the integration by parts formula:\n\n\u222bln(x)/sin(x) dx = -ln(x) ln|cos(x)| - \u222b-ln|cos(x)| * 1/x dx\n               = -ln(x) ln|cos(x)| + \u222bln|cos(x)| * 1/x dx\n\nThis integral can be simplified by using a substitution method, which leads to not being able to find a nice closed form solution.
