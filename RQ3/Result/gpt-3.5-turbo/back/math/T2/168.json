Integration by parts is a technique based on the product rule for differentiation, which states that the integral of the product of two functions is equal to the product of one function integrated and the other function differentiated. \n\nFor the given function, let u = ln(x) and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = (1/x) dx and v = e^x.\n\nUsing the formula for integration by parts:\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\u222bln(x)/e^x dx = ln(x)e^x - \u222be^x(1/x) dx\n\nNow, we need to solve the second integral. This can be done by applying integration by parts again:\nLet u = 1/x and dv = e^x dx. Then, du = -1/x^2 dx and v = e^x.\n\nPlugging these values into the formula:\n\u222be^x(1/x) dx = (1/x)e^x - \u222be^x(-1/x^2) dx\n\u222be^x(1/x) dx = (1/x)e^x + \u222be^x/x^2 dx\n\nNow, the second integral on the right-hand side can be solved by dividing e^x/x^2 to the form (e^x)/x^2, which is a known integral.
