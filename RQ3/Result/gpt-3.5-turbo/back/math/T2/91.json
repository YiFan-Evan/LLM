Therefore, the integral of 1/sinh(x) is -coth(x).\n\nTo calculate the integral of x/sinh(x), we can use integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = csch(x)dx. Then, du = dx and v = -coth(x). Applying the integration by parts formula: \u222budv = uv - \u222bvdu, we have:\n\n\u222bx/sinh(x)dx = -xcoth(x) - \u222b-coth(x)dx\n                      = -xcoth(x) + \u222bcoth(x)dx\n\nRecall that coth(x) = cosh(x)/sinh(x). Therefore, \u222bcoth(x)dx = \u222bcosh(x)/sinh(x)dx. \n\nNow, let z = sinh(x). Then, dz = cosh(x)dx. Therefore, \u222bcosh(x)/sinh(x)dx = \u222bdz/z = ln|z| = ln|sinh(x)|.\n\nSubstituting everything back in and simplifying, we get:\n\n\u222b(1+x)/sinh(x)dx = -coth(x) - xcoth(x) + ln|sinh(x)| + C.\n\nSince we want to find the value of \u222b(1+4)/sinh(4)dx, we substitute x = 4 into the expression -coth(x) - xcoth(x) + ln|sinh(x)| and calculate it.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: -coth(4) - 4coth(4) + ln|sinh(4)|.

Therefore, we have:\n\n5\u222b(1/sinh(x))dx + 5\u222b(x/sinh(x))dx.\n\nUsing the same method as before, the integral of 1/sinh(x) is -coth(x), and the integral of x/sinh(x) is -xcoth(x) + ln|sinh(x)|.\n\nSubstituting these results back into the expression, we have:\n\n5(-coth(x) - xcoth(x) + ln|sinh(x)|).\n\nTo find the value of 5*((1+4)/sinh(4)), we substitute x = 4 into the expression and calculate it:\n\n5(-coth(4) - 4coth(4) + ln|sinh(4)|).\n\nFinally, we round down the result to get the integer value.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is the integer value after evaluating the expression 5*(-coth(4) - 4coth(4) + ln|sinh(4)|) and rounding down."}]
