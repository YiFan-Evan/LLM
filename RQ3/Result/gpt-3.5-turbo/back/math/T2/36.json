Integration by parts is a technique based on the product rule for differentiation, which states that the derivative of the product of two functions is the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function.\n\nUsing integration by parts, we let u = ln(x) and dv = dx. Then, we calculate du and v:\n- du = 1/x dx\n- v = x\n\nNow, we use the formula for integration by parts:\n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nPlugging in our values, we get:\n\u222bln(x) dx = x*ln(x) - \u222bx * 1/x dx\n\u222bln(x) dx = x*ln(x) - \u222bdx\n\u222bln(x) dx = x*ln(x) - x + C\n\nTo find the value at x = 4, we substitute x = 4 into the equation:\n4*ln(4) - 4 = 4*2 - 4 = 8 - 4 = 4\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 4."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(ln(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of 5ln(x), we can apply the constant multiple rule of integration.
