Integration by parts is a technique that 'reverses' the product rule for differentiation. It states that the integral of the product of two functions is equal to the first function times the integral of the second function minus the integral of the derivative of the first function times the integral of the second function.\n\nIn this case, we let u = ln(x) and dv = sin(x)dx. Then, we calculate the differentials to get du = (1/x)dx and v = -cos(x). \n\nNow, we use the formula for integration by parts: \n\u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nApplying the formula, we get:\n\u222bln(x)*sin(x) dx = -ln(x) * cos(x) - \u222b(-cos(x))*(1/x) dx\n\nIntegrating the second term, we get:\n-\u222b(cos(x)/x) dx\n\nThis new integral does not have an elementary antiderivative, so we cannot directly find the antiderivative. We can now evaluate the integral in terms of the Sine Integral function Si(x), which is defined as Si(x) = -\u222b(sin(t)/t) dt.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of ln(x)*sin(x) is -ln(x)*cos(x) + Si(x) + C.\n\nSubstitute x = 4 into the indefinite integral, we get:\n-ln(4)*cos(4) + Si(4)\n\nNow, we need to find the value of Si(4).
