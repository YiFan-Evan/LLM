Let u = e^x, then du = e^x dx. This means dx = du/u.\n\nSubstituting these into the integral, we get the integral of 2sin(x) / (e^x - e^(-x)) dx = 2\u222bsin(x) / (e^x - e^(-x)) dx = 2\u222bsin(x) / (u - 1/u) du = 2\u222b(sin(x)/2) / sinh(x) dx.\n\nNow, the integral of sin(x)/2 in terms of x is -cos(x)/2.
