Integration by parts is a technique that comes from the product rule of differentiation, which states that the derivative of the product of two functions is equal to the derivative of the first function times the second function plus the first function times the derivative of the second function. \n\nIn this case, we can let u = x^2 and dv = 1/sin(x)dx.
