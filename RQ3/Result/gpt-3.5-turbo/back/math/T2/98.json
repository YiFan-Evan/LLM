Integration by parts is a technique based on the product rule for differentiation and can be used to find the antiderivative of a product of two functions.\n\nThe formula for integration by parts is: \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du\n\nLet's choose u = x and dv = sinh(x) dx. Then, we have du = dx and v = \u222bsinh(x) dx.\n\nTo find v, we can recognize that the derivative of cosh(x) is sinh(x), so v = cosh(x).\n\nNow, applying the integration by parts formula:\n\u222bsinh(x)*x dx = x*cosh(x) - \u222bcosh(x) dx\n                         = x*cosh(x) - sinh(x) + C\n\nTo find the final result, we substitute x = 4 into the expression:\n4*cosh(4) - sinh(4) \n\nCalculating this expression gives us:\n4*27.308232836016086 - 27.28991719712775 \u2248 97.233947272\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: 97."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sinh(x)*x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the indefinite integral of the function 5*sinh(x)*x, we can similarly use integration by parts.\n\nLet's choose u = 5*x and dv = sinh(x) dx.
