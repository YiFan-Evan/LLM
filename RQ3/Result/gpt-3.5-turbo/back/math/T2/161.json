Integration by parts is a technique based on the product rule for differentiation. The formula for integration by parts is \u222bu dv = uv - \u222bv du, where u and v are differentiable functions of x.\n\nIn this case, let's choose u = sin(x) and dv = (1/x)*(e^(-x)) dx. Then, calculate the differentials:\ndu = cos(x) dx\nv = -e^(-x)\n\nNow apply the integration by parts formula:\n\u222b(1/x)*sin(x)*e^(-x) dx = (-sin(x)*e^(-x)) - \u222b(-e^(-x)*cos(x)) dx\n                    = -sin(x)*e^(-x) + \u222be^(-x)*cos(x) dx\n\nNow, we need to apply integration by parts again for the new integral. Let's choose u = cos(x) and dv = e^(-x) dx:\ndu = -sin(x) dx\nv = -e^(-x)\n\nApply the integration by parts formula again:\n\u222be^(-x)*cos(x) dx = cos(x)*(-e^(-x)) - \u222b(-e^(-x)*(-sin(x))) dx\n                    = -cos(x)*e^(-x) + \u222be^(-x)*sin(x) dx\n\nSubstitute this back into the original integration:\n\u222b(1/x)*sin(x)*e^(-x) dx = -sin(x)*e^(-x) - (-cos(x)*e^(-x) + \u222be^(-x)*sin(x) dx)\nTherefore, the final answer is: 0\n\nNow, substitute x = 4 into the result:\n- sin(4) * e^(-4) - (-cos(4) * e^(-4) + \u222be^(-4) * sin(4) dx)\nBy evaluating the trigonometric functions and the exponential term, we get an integral of e^(-4) * sin(4) which simplifies to e^(-4) * sin(4).
