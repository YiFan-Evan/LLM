The chain rule states that if we have an inner function g(x) and an outer function f(u), then the indefinite integral of f(g(x)) with respect to x is equal to the integral of f(u) du, where u is the inner function.\n\nIn this case, the inner function is cos(x) and the outer function is sin(u). The derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x), so the integral of sin(cos(x)) with respect to x becomes the integral of sin(u) du, which is -cos(u) + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n\nTherefore, the indefinite integral of sin(cos(x)) is -cos(cos(x)) + C.\n\nNow, substituting x=4 into the indefinite integral, we get:\n-cos(cos(4))\n\nCalculating the value of this expression gives approximately -0.995, but we need to round down to the nearest integer:\nTherefore, the final answer is: -1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(sin(cos(x)))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To calculate the indefinite integral of 5*sin(cos(x)), we will again use the chain rule for integration. \n\nThe integral of 5*sin(cos(x)) can be found by integrating sin(u) with respect to u, where u = cos(x).
