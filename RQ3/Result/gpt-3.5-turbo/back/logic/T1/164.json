By using premise (4), we can conclude that Fae is nervous. Additionally, based on premise (5), we can deduce that Fae is a tumpus due to being fruity and a zumpus. Further, from premise (3), we can deduce that Fae is a lempus because Fae is cold and a brimpus. Leveraging premise (2) allows us to establish that Fae is a mean brimpus and, therefore, a zumpus.
