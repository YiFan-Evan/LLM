[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx.

Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation).

This can be done by reasoning through Stella's properties as implied by the premises, and then connecting these properties to the definition of a vumpus.\n\nFrom premise (10), we know that \"Stella is a grimpus and a brimpus\", which means Stella has the properties of being both a grimpus and a brimpus. In turn, from premise (6) we know that \"Every numpus is a grimpus\", and from premise (9) we know \"Each brimpus is a lorpus and a wumpus\".
