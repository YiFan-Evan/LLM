[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following problems, you will be given a series of propositions as premises and a proof obligation. The premises are in the form '(1) xxx. (2) xxx. (3) xxx. ...', and the proof obligation is in the form 'Prove: (n) xxx.' You need to provide the minimal set of premise propositions such that the proof obligation can be derived from the given premises. You should present the result in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)', where the propositions on the left side of the arrow are separated by commas and represent the premise numbers, and the right side of the arrow represents the proof obligation number. Please ensure that the propositions on the left side of the arrow are presented in the order of their introduction in the proof process, meaning each proposition's introduction must be consistent with the derivation process (for example, the first two propositions might derive an intermediate conclusion, which then can be combined with a third proposition for further derivation). The answer should only be in the form '(1),(2),(3),...->(n)'.(For each problem, you need to first explain the fundamental principles involved in solving it, and then provide the answer to the problem in the form of \"Therefore, the final answer is: \".)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Premises: [(1) Each brimpus is a wumpus.

The key here is to use the information provided to show that Stella belongs to the category of wumpuses.\n\nTo prove that Stella is a wumpus, we can follow this reasoning:\n- From premise (11), we know that Stella is a brimpus, a jompus, or a numpus.\n- From premise (1), we know that each brimpus is a wumpus. Therefore, if Stella is a brimpus, then Stella is a wumpus.\n- From premise (2), we know that every jompus is a wumpus.
