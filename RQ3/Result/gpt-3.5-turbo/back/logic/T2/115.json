To do this, we need to trace back the properties of a lorpus based on the given premises.\n\nFrom premise (8), we know that Sally is discordant, melodic, a numpus, and a rompus. And from premise (9), we know that Sally is aggressive, mean, a shumpus, and a lempus.

Furthermore, from premise (6), we know that zumpuses are discordant, melodic, jompuses, and numpuses. Since Sally is a numpus and has the properties of a zumpus, we can conclude that Sally is a zumpus.\n\nFrom premise (6), we also know that zumpuses are related to jompuses, which are transparent, opaque, brimpuses, and vumpuses (premise 7). Since Sally is a zumpus, and therefore related to jompuses, we can infer that Sally is also transparent, opaque, a brimpus, and a vumpus.\n\nNext, looking at premise (5), we see that wumpuses are aggressive, mean, shumpuses, and lempuses. By premise (6), zumpuses are also related to wumpuses. Therefore, since Sally is a zumpus, she must also be aggressive, mean, a shumpus, and a lempus.\n\nSimilarly, premise (3) states that lorpsuses are temperate, hot, dumpuses, and wumpuses.
