Therefore, Polly being a rompus (1) implies that Polly is a lempus.\n\nNext, we need to establish that Polly is dull and bright. We can use propositions (12) and (11) to connect these characteristics. Proposition (12) states that everything that is dull and bright and a lempus is a zumpus. Since we already established that Polly is a lempus, we can combine proposition (12) with Polly being dull (3) and Polly being bright (5) to conclude that Polly is a zumpus.
