To prove that Taylor is a visionary, we need to identify the minimal set of premises that lead to this conclusion by applying logical inference and deduction.\n\nTo prove that Taylor is a visionary, we first observe that premise 1 establishes a conditional relationship between Polly being a rompus and Taylor being a visionary. Since we have the premise that Polly is a vumpus and a gorpus (from premise 11), and from the premise that dumpuses are rompuses and yumpuses (from premise 3), Polly being a dumpus implies Polly is a rompus.
