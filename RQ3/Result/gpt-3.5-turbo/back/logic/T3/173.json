We can start by examining the propositions that directly relate to the properties of zumpuses and then use this information to show that Fae cannot be a zumpus. \n\nAs per the premises:\n- Zumpuses are sterpuses, grimpuses, and impuses (from premise 2). This tells us that all zumpuses are sterpuses, grimpuses, and impuses.\n- Each zumpus is a brimpus (from premise 4). This indicates that all zumpuses are also brimpuses.\n\nNow, from the given information, we can derive that if Fae is a zumpus, then Fae must be a sterpus, grimpus, impus, and brimpus. However, we already know the following about Fae:\n- Fae is a jompus (from premise 3).\n- Fae is a jompus, a shumpus, and a numpus (from premise 13).\n- Fae is a vumpus, Fae is not a rompus, and Fae is a wumpus (from premise 14).\n\nBased on the above information, we see that Fae cannot simultaneously possess the properties of being a jompus, a shumpus, a numpus, a vumpus, and a wumpus while also being a sterpus, grimpus, impus, and brimpus required to be a zumpus.

The key premise that we have to work with is the first one - \"if Fae is not a zumpus then Taylor is a visionary\", as this connects Fae's identity to Taylor being a visionary.\n\nFirstly, we can deduce that Fae is indeed not a zumpus based on premise 4. Since there is no claim to the contrary in the premises, we assume that Fae is not a zumpus.\n\nGiven that Fae is not a zumpus, according to premise 1, Taylor is a visionary. Therefore, based on this chain of reasoning and utilizing the provided premises, we can conclude that Taylor is a visionary.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: (1,4)->(16)"}]
