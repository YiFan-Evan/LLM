Insertion sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by dividing the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region. At each iteration, the algorithm removes one element from the input data and finds the location it belongs within the sorted region, and repeats until the unsorted region becomes empty.\n\nIn this specific algorithm, the outer loop variable `j` is initialized with the length of the array and decremented in each iteration until it reaches zero. This indicates that the right portion of the array, `arr[j:len(arr)]`, is already sorted. The inner loop variable `z` is used to compare and swap elements in the array until the current element is in the correct position within the sorted region.\n\nTo find a loop invariant, we need to identify a property that holds true for each iteration of the loop.
