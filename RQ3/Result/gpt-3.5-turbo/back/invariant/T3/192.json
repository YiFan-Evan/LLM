The selection sort algorithm works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. It partitions the array into a sorted and an unsorted region. Initially, the sorted region is empty, and the unsorted region is the entire array. In each iteration of the outer loop, the minimum element from the unsorted region is placed at its correct position in the sorted region.\n\nTo find a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop, we need to identify a property that is true before and after the execution of the inner loop. In this case, we can use the loop invariant to show that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the first i elements in the array are sorted in non-decreasing order.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n'm_value = fun(arr[0:m]->arr[0:m] in non-decreasing order)'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    m = len(arr)\n    while m > 0:\n        m -= 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[m]:\n                temp = arr[m]\n                arr[m] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the provided selection sort code snippet, the outer loop decrements `m` from the length of the array down to 1 and the inner loop decrements `z` from `m` down to 0.
