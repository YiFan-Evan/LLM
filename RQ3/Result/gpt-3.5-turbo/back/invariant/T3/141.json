A loop invariant is a condition that should be true before and after each iteration of the loop. It helps demonstrate that the loop is correctly implemented and helps show that the function performs the intended task.\n\nIn this specific case, the function `give_sum` iterates over the input array `arr`, accumulating the sum of its elements in the variable `sum_value`. For the loop invariant, we need to express how the `sum_value` is related to the elements of `arr` at each iteration.\n\nWhen analyzing the loop, we can observe that the loop invariant should be of the form `sum_value = fun(arr[0]+arr[1]+...+arr[b-1])`, where `arr[0]+arr[1]+...+arr[b-1]` represents the sum of the elements encountered in the array up to the current iteration `b`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n`sum_value = sum(arr[0:b])`.

As before, the function iterates over the input array `arr`, accumulating the sum of its elements in the variable `sum_value`. We need to express how the `sum_value` is related to the elements of `arr` at each iteration.\n\nIn this case, since the loop is iterating backwards over the array `arr`, the loop invariant should consider the sum of elements encountered in reverse order. Thus, the loop invariant should be of the form `sum_value = fun(arr[b]+arr[b+1]+...+arr[len(arr)-1])`, where `arr[b]+arr[b+1]+...+arr[len(arr)-1]` represents the sum of the elements encountered in the array from the current position `b` to the end of the array.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n`sum_value = sum(arr[b:])`."}]
