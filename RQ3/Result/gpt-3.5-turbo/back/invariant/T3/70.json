[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

In this situation, we need to maintain a statement that holds true both before and after each iteration of the loop. \n\nFor this specific problem, the loop invariant should capture the fact that at any point during the iteration, `id_value` holds the correct index (or value) where `target` is found within the array `arr`.
