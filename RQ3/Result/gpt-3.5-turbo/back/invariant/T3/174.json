Insertion sort works by iterating through the array elements from left to right, ensuring that the elements to the left of the current element are sorted in each iteration. The inner loop starts from the current index and moves towards the beginning of the array, repeatedly swapping adjacent elements until the current element is inserted into its correct position in the sorted part of the array.\n\nTo find the loop invariant, we need to identify a condition that holds true before and after each iteration of the inner loop. This condition should help us understand the state of the array at any point within the loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be stated as:\n\n'z_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[z])'\n\nThis loop invariant states that the subarray from index 0 to index z is sorted after the i-th iteration of the inner loop."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    o = len(arr)\n    while o > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        o -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find a loop invariant for the insertion sort algorithm's inner loop, we need to understand the purpose of this algorithm. In this case, the insertion sort algorithm is sorting the elements of the input array in non-decreasing order.\n\nThe inner loop keeps swapping adjacent elements if the element to the left is greater than the current element.
