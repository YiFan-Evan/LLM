A loop invariant is a condition or predicate that is true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\nIn this case, the loop invariant should reflect that `max_value` contains the maximum value found so far in the array `arr`.\n\nOne way to approach this is to define the loop invariant as `max_value = max(arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[l-1])`. Initially, `max_value = arr[0]` which is true before the loop starts. After each iteration of the loop, we update `max_value` if the current element is greater than the `max_value`.

The loop invariant should hold true for each iteration of the loop and help us understand what is being computed.\n\nGiven the nature of the loop where we are iterating backwards from the last element of the array to the first element, we can define the loop invariant as `max_value = max(arr[l], arr[l+1], ..., arr[n-1])`, where `n` is the length of the array `arr`. Initially, `max_value = arr[-1]` is the maximum value of the subarray `arr[l:n]`, which includes only the last element of the array.\n\nAfter each iteration of the loop, if the current element at `arr[l]` is greater than `max_value`, then `max_value` is updated to be the current element. This process ensures that at any iteration `l`, the `max_value` holds the maximum value of the remaining subarray `arr[l:n]`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant is: `max_value = max(arr[l], arr[l+1], ..., arr[n-1])`."}]
