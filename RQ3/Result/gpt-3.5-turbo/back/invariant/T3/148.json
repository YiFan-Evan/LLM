[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop continues until it reaches the end of the input array.\n\nTo come up with a loop invariant, we need to identify a property that holds true at the beginning of each iteration, as well as when the loop terminates. In this case, it is apparent that at the i-th iteration, the sum of the elements from `arr[0]` to `arr[i-1]` has been accumulated in the `sum_value` variable.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be formulated as:\n'i_value = sum(arr[0] to arr[i-1])'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    i = len(arr)\n    while i > 0:\n        i -= 1\n        sum_value += arr[i]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop in the revised Python program, we need to consider the changes made in the code.

In this scenario, at the i-th iteration, the sum of the elements from `arr[i]` to `arr[len(arr)-1]` has been accumulated in the `sum_value` variable.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n'i_value = sum(arr[i] to arr[len(arr)-1])'."}]
