[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Initialization: Before the first iteration of the loop, when t = 0, the loop invariant states that the minimum value among arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[i-1] is stored in min_value. Since the array is unsorted at this point, there are no specific conditions to check.\n\n2. Maintenance: For each subsequent iteration of the loop, the current element (arr[i]) is compared to the minimum value (min_value). The loop invariant assures that min_value stores the minimum value from arr[0] to arr[i-1]. If arr[i] is smaller than min_value, the minimum value is updated to arr[i]. This guarantees that min_value always stores the minimum value among arr[t], arr[t+1], ..., arr[i], satisfying the loop invariant.\n\n3. Termination: The loop terminates when t reaches len(arr) - 1. At this point, the loop invariant ensures that min_value stores the minimum value among arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[len(arr)-1].
