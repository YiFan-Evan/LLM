In this case, the algorithm is doing an insertion sort on the input array `arr`. The inner loop starting from index `z` moves elements towards the beginning of the array until the current element at index `z` is placed in its correct sorted position.\n\nBased on this understanding, we can define the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop as the following:\n- `z_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z])`\nThis loop invariant states that the subarray from index 0 up to `z` (inclusive) is sorted at the beginning of each iteration of the inner loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n`z_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[z])`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = len(arr)\n    while q > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        q -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In insertion sort algorithm, the outer loop in the provided code is iterating through each element of the array from right to left considering that the right side of the array is already sorted.
