Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and moving it to the beginning. The outer loop selects the first unsorted element, while the inner loop iterates over the remaining unsorted elements to find the minimum and swap it with the current first unsorted element.\n\nFor the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the elements at indices 0 up to (i-1) are already sorted in non-decreasing order.
