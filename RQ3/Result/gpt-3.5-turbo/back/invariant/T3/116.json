[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The function `give_member` takes an array `arr` and an index `id`, then iterates over the array until it finds the element at the index `id` and returns that element if found, otherwise it returns -1.\n\nTo find a loop invariant, we need to identify a condition that is true before and after each loop iteration. In this case, we can use the loop invariant: \n\n'member_value = fun(arr[q] -> arr[id])'\n\nThis statement ensures that the `member_value` always holds the value of the element at index `id` if it has been encountered in the previous iterations.
