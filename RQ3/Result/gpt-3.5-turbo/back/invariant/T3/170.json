The loop invariant should be a statement that is true before and after each iteration of the inner loop.\n\nFor the given target code:\n1.

The inner loop starts from index `i` and iterates backwards, moving the element at `arr[i]` to its correct position in the sorted sublist. As the loop progresses, the elements `arr[z]` and `arr[z-1]` are compared and swapped if necessary.\n3. After each iteration of the inner loop, the elements `arr[z-1]` and `arr[z]` are in sorted order within the sublist `arr[0:i]`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop is:\n`z_value = arr[z] -> arr[z-1] <= arr[z]`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = len(arr)\n    while k > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        k -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this code snippet, the `insertion_sort` function also implements the insertion sort algorithm but with a slight modification in the loop conditions compared to the previous code snippet.
