The initialization of variable 's' should be 'len(arr) - 1' instead of 'len(arr)'.\n2. The initialization of variable 'z' inside the inner loop should be 's' instead of 'i'.\n3. The condition in the inner loop `while z > 0` should be `while z >= 0` to correct the comparison. \n\nAfter fixing these issues, the corrected code for the selection_sort function would be as follows:\n\n```python\ndef selection_sort(arr):\n    s = len(arr) - 1\n    while s >= 0:\n        s -= 1\n        z = s\n        while z >= 0:\n            z -= 1\n            if arr[z] < arr[s]:\n                temp = arr[s]\n                arr[s] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n    return arr\n```\n\nNow, to find a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop in the corrected selection_sort function, we need to consider that the inner loop in this function is trying to find the maximum element in the unsorted part of the array and place it at the correct position.\n\nThe loop invariant should reflect that the elements from index s+1 to the end of the array are greater than or equal to all elements from index 0 to s.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be as follows:\n\n`s+1 <= k <= len(arr) => arr[k] >= arr[s]`"}]
