[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

A loop invariant is a condition or predicate that is true before and after each iteration of the loop. To do this, we need to identify a property that is true at the beginning of each iteration, and it logically follows that the property is true at the end of each iteration.\n\nIn this particular case, the loop invariant can be: \"max_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[d-1])\"\n\n- Initialization: Before the loop starts, d is 0, and the property states that max_value is equal to the maximum value seen from index 0 to index d-1, which in this case is just element at index 0. This holds true as the maximum value seen so far is the first element of the array. So, the loop invariant is satisfied before the loop starts.\n\n- Maintenance: Assuming that the loop invariant holds at the start of an iteration, when we go inside the loop, we compare the current element at index d with max_value. If the current element is greater, we update max_value to the current element. Therefore, at the end of the iteration, max_value will still hold the maximum value seen from index 0 to index d, satisfying the loop invariant for the next iteration.\n\n- Termination: The loop will terminate when d is equal to the length of the array.
