[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

The loop iterates over the list elements, compares each element with the current minimum value, and updates the minimum value if a smaller element is found.\n\nTo prove the correctness of the program, we can define a loop invariant that should hold true for each iteration of the loop. The loop invariant should help us demonstrate that when the loop terminates, we have the correct minimum value stored in `min_value`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n'min_value = min(arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[i-1])'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[-1]\n    p = len(arr)\n    while p > 0:\n        p -= 1\n        if arr[p] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[p]\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this code snippet, the `find_min` function takes a list `arr` as input and iterates over the elements in reverse order to find the minimum value in the list.
