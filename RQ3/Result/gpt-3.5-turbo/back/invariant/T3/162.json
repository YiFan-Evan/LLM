Insertion sort works by iterating over the input array, and for each element, it compares it with the elements on its left side and places it in its correct position. \n\nIn this case, the inner loop of the insertion sort algorithm is responsible for swapping elements and placing the current element in its correct sorted position within the array.\n\nTo find the loop invariant for the inner loop, we need to identify a condition that is true every time the loop is executed. In this case, the loop invariant should indicate that the subarray from index 0 to i (inclusive) is sorted after the i-th iteration of the inner loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be stated as:\n\n'i_value = arr[0:i+1] is sorted.'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    c = len(arr)\n    while c > 0:\n        z = i\n        while z < len(arr) and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z += 1\n        c -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find a loop invariant for the inner loop of the insertion sort algorithm, let's understand the logic behind the insertion sort algorithm.
