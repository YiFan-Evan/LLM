The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

In this case, the loop iterates over the elements of the input array `arr` and updates the `mid_value` variable to hold the value of the element at position `g` where `g` increases in each iteration. The loop continues until `2 * g` is no longer less than the length of the array `arr`.\n\nIn order to prove the correctness of the loop, we need to find a loop invariant that remains true each time the loop iterates.
