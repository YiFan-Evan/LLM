The function `give_id` aims to find the index of the 'target' element in the input list 'arr'. The loop iterates through the elements of the list 'arr' and updates the 'id_value' with the index of the 'target' element if it is found. \n\nNow, to prove the partial correctness of the function using a loop invariant, we need to identify a statement that is true before entering the loop, is preserved by the loop iterations, and helps establish the correctness of the output 'id_value' after the loop terminates.\n\nThe loop invariant should reflect the relationship between the 'id_value' and the elements of the array 'arr'.
