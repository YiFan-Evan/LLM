To construct the loop invariant, we need to consider the state of the sum at each iteration and the progress made through the array.\n\nThe loop invariant in this case could be in the form of `sum_value = sum(arr[0:p])`, indicating that `sum_value` is equal to the sum of elements from the beginning of the array up to the current index `p`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the while loop is `sum_value = sum(arr[0:p])`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    p = len(arr)\n    while p > 0:\n        p -= 1\n        sum_value += arr[p]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this case, the loop in the `give_sum` function iterates over the elements of the input array in reverse order and calculates the sum of these elements.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the function, we need to find a loop invariant for the while loop.
