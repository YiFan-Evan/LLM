Initialization: The loop invariant should hold true before the loop starts, i.e., at the beginning of the loop.\n2. Maintenance: Assuming the loop invariant holds true for the i-th iteration of the loop, we should prove that it also holds true for the i+1-th iteration.\n3. Termination: After the loop terminates, the loop invariant along with the loop condition should help us deduce the correctness of the program.\n\nNow, let's proceed to provide the loop invariant for the `find_min` function:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n'0_value = min(arr[0]->arr[r-1]')"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    r = 0\n    while r <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if arr[r] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[r]\n        r += 1\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this case, the loop invariant should ensure that the minimum value found so far is correctly stored in `min_value` after each iteration.
