A loop invariant is a condition that must be true at the beginning and end of each iteration of a loop. In this case, the loop in the program iterates over the elements of the input array `arr` until the condition `2 * m < len(arr)` is no longer satisfied.\n\nTo find the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop, we need to identify a statement that remains true for both the initial and final steps of the i-th iteration. In this specific case, the loop assigns the value of `arr[m]` to `mid_value` and then increments `m` by 1. Therefore, a suitable loop invariant would involve the relationship between `mid_value`, `m`, and the elements of the array `arr`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n'mid_value = arr[m-1]->arr[m-1]'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    m = 0\n    while 2 * m <= len(arr) - 1:\n        mid_value = arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return mid_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In order to prove the partial correctness of the given program, we need to provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop.
