The inner loop, using variable `z`, is responsible for shifting the current element to its correct position in the sorted sequence. The inner loop shifts the element `arr[z]` to the appropriate position in the sorted part of the array by comparing it with preceding elements.\n\nTo provide a loop invariant, we need to identify an expression that remains true for each iteration of the loop, including the initialization, maintenance, and termination steps. The loop invariant should help in proving the correctness of the sorting algorithm by ensuring that the elements to the left of the current position are sorted.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop is:\n'i_value = arr[z] is in its correct sorted position compared to the elements to its left'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    h = 0\n    while h <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        h += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Therefore, the final answer is:\n'i_value = arr[z] is in its correct sorted position compared to the elements to its left'"}]
