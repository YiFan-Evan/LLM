Selection sort works by iteratively selecting the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it at the beginning of the array.\n\nFor the given code, the outer loop variable 'g' represents the index of the element currently being sorted in the array. The inner loop variable 'z' iterates over the unsorted portion of the array to find the minimum element. During each iteration of the inner loop, if arr[z] is smaller than arr[g], the elements at indices 'z' and 'g' are swapped.\n\nTherefore, to establish a loop invariant, we need to specify a condition that holds true for each iteration of both the outer and inner loops. The loop invariant for this selection sort algorithm should ensure that the prefix of the array up to index 'g' is sorted in non-decreasing order while elements after index 'g' are greater than all the elements before index 'g'.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n'g_value = sorted(arr[0:g]) and arr[g:] > arr[0:g]'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    g = 0\n    while g <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = g + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[g]:\n                temp = arr[g]\n                arr[g] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        g += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given Python code for selection sort, the loops iterate using the variables 'g' and 'z' to sort the array in non-decreasing order.
