The goal of insertion sort is to sort an array in ascending order. The outer loop in the given code is responsible for iterating over each element of the array and inserting it into its correct position in the sorted part of the array to the left.\n\nHere are the steps to identify a loop invariant:\n1. Initialization: The loop invariant holds true before the first iteration of the loop.\n2. Maintenance: If the loop invariant is true before an iteration of the loop, it remains true before the next iteration.\n3. Termination: The loop invariant, when combined with the loop condition, is sufficient to show that the algorithm is correct after termination.\n\nNow let's find the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n'z_value = fun(arr[0..z-1] -> arr[0..z-1] sorted)'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    p = 0\n    while p <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        p += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the provided `insertion_sort` function, there is a mistake in the loop condition of the outer loop.
