[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

So we update the member_value to equal arr[d].\n- The loop continues to iterate until d becomes equal to the length of the array.\n- At the end of the loop, the member_value will be either -1 if the member was not found, or the value of the member in the array.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is \"member_value = arr[d]\".\n\nNote: This loop invariant assumes that the array arr is indexed starting from 0.

This ensures that member_value will hold the correct value of the member corresponding to the given id if it exists in the array.\n- The loop iterates until d becomes equal to the length of the array minus 1.
