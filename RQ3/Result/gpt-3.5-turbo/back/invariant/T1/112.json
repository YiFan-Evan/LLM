We do this by coming up with a loop invariant that is true before the first iteration, is preserved through each iteration, and when the loop terminates, helps establish the correctness of the loop's output.\n\nIn this program, the function `give_member` is supposed to find and return the element in the input array `arr` corresponding to the given `id`. To prove its partial correctness, we need to find a loop invariant that captures the state of the iteration.\n\nIn this case, the loop invariant can be set up as follows:\nAt the beginning of each iteration of the loop, the loop invariant should state that `member_value` will be equal to `fun(arr[id]->arr[m])`, where `fun(arr[id]->arr[m])` signifies that the value of `member_value` is the value at index `m` of the input array `arr` corresponding to the `id`.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is `member_value = fun(arr[id]->arr[m])`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    m = 0\n    while m <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if m == id:\n            member_value = arr[m]\n        m += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the provided function `give_member`, the loop iterates through each element of the input array `arr` and checks if the current index `m` is equal to the given `id`. If they are equal, the value at that index is assigned to `member_value`. The loop continues until `m` reaches the last index of the array.\n\nTo prove the partial correctness of the function and establish a loop invariant, we need to identify a property that holds true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop.\n\nIn this case, the loop invariant can be defined as follows:\nAt the start of the i-th iteration of the loop, the loop invariant states that `member_value` will be equal to `arr[id]`, if `id` is within the bounds of the array index. Otherwise, `member_value` remains unchanged.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \nThe loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is `member_value = fun(arr[id]->arr[m])`, where `fun(arr[id]->arr[m])` denotes that `member_value` corresponds to the value at index `id` of the input array `arr` if `id` is a valid index, otherwise `member_value` remains unchanged."}]
