Insertion sort works by iterating over the elements in the input array, moving each element to its correct position within the sorted part of the array.\n\nFor the insertion sort algorithm:\n- The outer loop variable k is used to iterate over each element in the array. The inner loop variable z is used to iterate backwards from the current element being processed.\n- The inner loop moves the element at index z to its correct position in the sorted part of the array by swapping it with the preceding elements until it is in its correct place.\n\nGiven this understanding, let's provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n'z_value = z'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    k = 0\n    while k <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        k += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the provided code snippet, the outer loop variable is denoted by \"k\" as it iterates over the elements in the array, and the inner loop variable is denoted by \"z\" as it iterates over the elements from the current position backward.\n\nTo establish the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop, we need to consider the properties of the insertion sort algorithm.
