Insertion sort works by taking one element at a time from the unsorted part of the array and placing it in its correct position within the sorted part of the array.\n\nDuring each iteration of the outer loop in the insertion sort algorithm, the subarray `arr[0:e]` is considered sorted, and the element at index `e` is taken from the unsorted part of the array and inserted into its correct position in the subarray `arr[0:e]`.\n\nNow let's find a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop:\n\n**Loop Invariant:** At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:e]` consists of elements originally in `arr[0:e]` sorted in non-decreasing order. The elements in `arr[0:e]` are the same elements that existed in `arr[0:e]` before the start of the iteration, but they may have been rearranged.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n`e_value = arr[e]->arr[e]`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    e = 0\n    while e <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        e += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the given insertion sort algorithm, the outer loop iterates over each element (from index 0 to len(arr)-1) to place it in its correct sorted position within the array by swapping elements as necessary in the inner loop.\n\nTo find a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the outer loop in the insertion sort algorithm,\n\n**Loop Invariant:** At the start of the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray `arr[0:e]` contains the first e elements of the original array arr but rearranged in non-decreasing order.
