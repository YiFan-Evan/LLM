Insertion sort works by taking one element at a time from the unsorted part of the array and placing it in the correct position in the sorted part of the array.\n\nIn this specific implementation:\n- The outer loop uses the variable `q` to iterate through each element of the array.\n- The inner loop uses the variable `z` to traverse the sorted part of the array and place the current element in its correct position within the sorted part.\n\nTo find the loop invariant for the i-th iteration, we need to identify a condition that remains true throughout each iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the insertion sort algorithm is:\n`z_value = arr[z] is in its correct sorted position in the array up to index z`."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    q = 0\n    while q <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n        q += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To find the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the updated insertion sort algorithm, the fundamental principles involved are still the same as explained previously.
