Initialization: The loop invariant should hold true before the first iteration of the loop.\n2. Maintenance: If the loop invariant holds true before an iteration of the loop, it should still hold true after the next iteration.\n3. Termination: When the loop terminates, the loop invariant should provide enough information to prove the correctness of the program.\n\nNow, let's derive the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\nsum_value = sum(arr[0:i])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    s = 0\n    while s <= len(arr) - 1:\n        sum_value += arr[s]\n        s += 1\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prove the partial correctness of the program, we need to define a loop invariant that holds true for each iteration of the loop.
