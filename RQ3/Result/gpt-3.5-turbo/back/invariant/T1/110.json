[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Maintenance: If the loop invariant is true before an iteration of the loop, it should still be true after the iteration.\n    c. Termination: When the loop terminates, the loop invariant should help us conclude that the postcondition holds, i.e., \"member_value\" contains the value at index \"id\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:  \n'member_value = arr[id]->arr[id]'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    k = 0\n    while k <= len(arr) - 1:\n        if k == id:\n            member_value = arr[k]\n        k += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prove the partial correctness of the given program, we need to provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the while loop.

Initialize the Loop Invariant: We need to define the loop invariant that holds true before the first iteration of the loop. In this case, since \"member_value\" is initialized to -1, it correctly reflects the value of the array element at index \"id\" if it is updated during the loop iterations.\n\n2. Maintain the Loop Invariant: Assume that the loop invariant holds true before iteration i. During the i-th iteration, if the index \"k\" is equal to \"id\", then the \"member_value\" is updated to \"arr[k]\", maintaining the loop invariant.\n\n3. Terminate and Verify the Correctness: After the loop termination, the loop invariant should indicate that \"member_value\" holds the correct value of the element at index \"id\" of the array \"arr\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:  \n'member_value = arr[id]->arr[id]'"}]
