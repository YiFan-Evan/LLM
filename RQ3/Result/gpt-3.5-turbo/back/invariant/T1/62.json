The function `give_id` takes an array `arr` and a target value `target` as input and returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in the array. If the target is not found, it returns -1.\n2. The loop in the code snippet iterates through the elements of the array `arr` and checks if the current element is equal to the target value.
