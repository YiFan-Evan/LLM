[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

In this case, the key variables are `sum_value`, `t`, and `arr`.\n\nThe loop in the code iterates over the elements of the array `arr`, adding each element to the `sum_value` variable. The loop variable `t` is used to index the elements of the array.
