[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

We want to show that `member_value` correctly holds the value of `arr[id]` if `id` is found in the array `arr`, and `-1` otherwise.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n`s != id -> member_value = -1; s = k -> member_value = arr[id] (k <= id)`"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    s = -1\n    while s < len(arr) - 1:\n        s += 1\n        if s == id:\n            member_value = arr[s]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prove the partial correctness of the modified `give_member` function, we need to provide a loop invariant that correctly captures the relationship between the loop variables (`s`), array `arr`, and the `member_value`.\n\nIn this case, the loop invariant should ensure that `member_value` is set to `arr[id]` when `id` is found in the array `arr`, and remains `-1` if `id` is not present in the array.
