The inner loop then iterates over the unsorted part of the array starting from `c + 1` to find the smallest element to swap with the element at index `c`.\n\nTo provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop, we need to consider the elements in the subarray starting from index `c+1` to the end of the array. The loop invariant should reflect the fact that after each iteration of the inner loop, the prefix of the subarray from index `c+1` to the current index `z` is sorted.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the inner loop can be formulated as follows:\n'z_value = min(arr[z:])'\n\nThis loop invariant indicates that after the i-th iteration of the outer loop, the subarray from index `z` to the end of the array contains the smallest element not yet placed at its correct position.\n\nPlease note that the loop invariant for the outer loop is not necessary for proving the partial correctness of this program."}]
