[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

A loop invariant is a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\nIn this case, the purpose of the loop is to iterate through the array `arr` and find the minimum value.

This means that `min_value` is equal to the minimum value of an empty subarray, which is the value of the first element `arr[0]`.\n- During each iteration of the loop, the invariant states that `min_value` is equal to the minimum value of the subarray `arr[0:d]`.\n- After each iteration, the value of `min_value` is updated if the current element `arr[d]` is smaller than the current minimum value.

This means that `min_value` is equal to the minimum value of an empty subarray, which is the value of the first element `arr[0]`.\n- During each iteration of the loop, the invariant states that `min_value` is equal to the minimum value of the subarray `arr[0:d]`.\n- After each iteration, the value of `min_value` is updated if the current element `arr[d]` is smaller than the current minimum value.
