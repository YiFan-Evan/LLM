During each iteration of the outer loop, the subarray from index 0 to l-1 is sorted, and we want to insert the element at index l into its correct position. \n\nTo prove the correctness of the insertion sort algorithm, we need to find a loop invariant that holds true at the beginning of each iteration of the inner loop (the while loop with variable z) during the i-th iteration of the outer loop.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n'z_value = arr[z] > arr[z - 1], z >= 0 and z <= i'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def insertion_sort(arr):\n    l = -1\n    while l < len(arr) - 1:\n        l += 1\n        z = i\n        while z > 0 and arr[z - 1] > arr[z]:\n            temp = arr[z]\n            arr[z] = arr[z - 1]\n            arr[z - 1] = temp\n            z -= 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In the provided insertion sort algorithm, the outer loop increments the variable 'l' by 1 in each iteration and the inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
