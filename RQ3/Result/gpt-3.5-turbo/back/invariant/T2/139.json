It helps in understanding what the loop is doing and proving its correctness. \n\nIn this case, the function `give_mid` simply iterates through the array and returns the mid_value.\n\n- **Initialization**: At the start of the loop, we have `t = 0`, and the initial value of `mid_value` is `arr[0]`. So, we can set the loop invariant as `mid_value = arr[0]`.\n\n- **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the loop, `mid_value` gets updated to `arr[t]` where `t` is the index of the array element being processed. So, the loop invariant can be `mid_value = arr[t]`.\n\n- **Termination**: When the loop terminates, `t` reaches a value such that `2 * t >= len(arr)`.

Therefore, the loop invariant can be set as `mid_value = arr[0]`.\n\n- **Maintenance**: During each iteration of the loop, `t` gets incremented by 1 and `mid_value` gets updated to `arr[t]`.
