[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

A loop invariant is a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\nIn this program, the loop iterates over each element of the input array 'arr' and if the current index 'o' matches the given id, it updates the 'member_value' with the element at that index. \n\nTo find the loop invariant, we need to identify a condition that remains true for each iteration of the loop. In this case, we can use the loop invariant 'member_value = fun(arr[0] -> arr[o-1])'.
