A loop invariant is a condition that is true before and after each iteration of a loop. It helps in understanding what the loop is doing and proving its correctness. In this case, we need to find a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the while loop in the 'give_count' function.\n\nFor the given 'give_count' function, the loop invariant should describe the relationship between the variables 'count_value', 'g', 'arr', and 'target' during the i-th iteration of the loop.
