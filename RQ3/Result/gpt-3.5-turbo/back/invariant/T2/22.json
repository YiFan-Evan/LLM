A loop invariant is a condition that is true before and after each iteration of the loop.\n\nIn this case, the loop invariant should relate to the minimum value found so far in the array. We need to show that at the start of each iteration of the loop, `min_value` contains the minimum value found in the first `c` elements of the array.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is:\n'c_value = min(arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[c-1])'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_min(arr):\n    min_value = arr[0]\n    c = -1\n    while c < len(arr) - 1:\n        c += 1\n        if arr[c] < min_value:\n            min_value = arr[c]\n    return min_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this `find_min` function, the loop starts at index `c=-1` and increments `c` before performing any comparison.
