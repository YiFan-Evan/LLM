[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

In this case, the loop calculates the sum of all elements in the array 'arr' by iterating over each element and adding it to the sum. The key variables here are 'r' which is the loop counter and 'sum_value' which accumulates the sum.\n\nTo come up with a loop invariant, we need to find a condition that holds true before, during, and after each iteration of the loop. In this case, the loop invariant should describe the relationship between the sum of elements seen so far (sum_value) and the elements in the array 'arr' that have been processed.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is: 'sum_value = fun(arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[r-1])'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    r = -1\n    while r < len(arr) - 1:\n        r += 1\n        sum_value += arr[r]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "In this loop, we need to come up with a loop invariant that is true before, during, and after each iteration.
