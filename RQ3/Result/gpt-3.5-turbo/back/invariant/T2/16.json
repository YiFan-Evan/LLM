This means we need to find a statement that is true before the loop begins (i.e., at the start of the first iteration).\n\n2. **Maintenance**: Assuming the loop invariant holds true at the beginning of an iteration, we need to show that it remains true after an iteration of the loop.\n\n3. **Termination**: When the loop ends, we need to state a loop invariant that helps prove the desired correctness of the program.\n\nNow, let's find the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the provided loop.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop is: \n'max_value = max(arr[0], arr[1], ..., arr[q-1])'."}, {"role": "user", "content": "def find_max(arr):\n    max_value = arr[0]\n    q = -1\n    while q < len(arr) - 1:\n        q += 1\n        if arr[q] > max_value:\n            max_value = arr[q]\n    return max_value\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prove the partial correctness of the modified program `find_max`, we need to provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop. \n\nThe provided loop in the function iterates over the array `arr` to find the maximum value in it.
