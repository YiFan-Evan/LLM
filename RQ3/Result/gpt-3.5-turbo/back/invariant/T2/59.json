[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

This means that count_value represents the number of occurrences of the target in the subarray arr[0:t] at the i-th iteration of the loop.\n\nProof:\n- Initialization: Before the loop starts, count_value is 0 because there haven't been any occurrences of the target in the subarray arr[0:0]. Therefore, the loop invariant holds true at the beginning.\n- Maintenance: At each iteration of the loop, we check if arr[t] is equal to the target. If it is, we increment count_value by 1, which means that we have found an additional occurrence of the target in the subarray arr[0:t+1].

Since t is initialized to -1, arr[0:t] is an empty array. Therefore, the loop invariant holds true at the beginning.\n- Maintenance: At each iteration of the loop, we increment t by 1 and then check if arr[t] is equal to the target. If it is, we increment count_value by 1, which means that we have found an additional occurrence of the target in the subarray arr[0:t+1]. Therefore, the loop invariant is maintained.\n- Termination: The loop terminates when t becomes equal to the length of arr - 1. At this point, count_value represents the number of occurrences of the target in the entire array arr[0:len(arr)], which is the desired result.
