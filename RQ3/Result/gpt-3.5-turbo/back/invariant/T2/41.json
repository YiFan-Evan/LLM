[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop variable `b` starts at 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until it reaches the length of the `arr` list. \n\nThe loop invariant should be a condition that is true for each iteration of the loop, helping to prove the correctness of the function.
