[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name.

The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'.

Instead of initializing `n` to 0 and incrementing it by 1 in each iteration, `n` is initialized to -1 and incremented by 1 at the beginning of the loop body. This means that `n` will actually represent the index of the current element being processed in the loop. To account for this, we should modify the loop invariant to `last_value = arr[n]`, as the `n` index now corresponds to the current element.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is: \n\n`last_value = arr[n]`"}]
