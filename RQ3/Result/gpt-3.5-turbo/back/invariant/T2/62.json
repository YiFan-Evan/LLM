The loop invariant should provide relevant information about the values of variables and their relationships to each other.\n\nNow, let's derive the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop:\n\n1. **Initialization**: At the beginning (i=0), the value of `id_value` is initialized to -1, and the loop starts at index 0.\n\n2. **Maintenance**: Assume that the loop invariant holds true at the beginning of the i-th iteration.
