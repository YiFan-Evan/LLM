A loop invariant is a condition that should hold true for each iteration of the loop, which could help in proving the correctness of the loop.\n\nIn this specific case, we can identify the loop invariant by observing the behavior of the variables within the loop. We see that `sum_value` is being updated in each iteration by adding the element at index `e` of the `arr`. The loop runs until `e` becomes equal to the length of the `arr`.\n\nTherefore, the loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop can be stated as:\n'i' = e -> 'sum_value = fun(arr[0:i]->arr[0:i])'"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_sum(arr):\n    sum_value = 0\n    e = -1\n    while e < len(arr) - 1:\n        e += 1\n        sum_value += arr[e]\n    return sum_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "To prove the partial correctness of the `give_sum` function, we need to find a loop invariant for the while loop.
