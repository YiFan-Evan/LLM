(According to the model, the predicted option \"ask questions'\" was chosen because of the reason-words \"be_my_guest\" and \"attempt_to_make_friends\".

The other reason-words in the top 5 (\"family_pajamas\", \"died\", and \"children\") do not seem to be directly related to the question and may have appeared in the model's reasoning for other reasons.)\nOptions: A. ask questions B. count to ten C. costume D. state name E. dress herself"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A. ask questions"}]
