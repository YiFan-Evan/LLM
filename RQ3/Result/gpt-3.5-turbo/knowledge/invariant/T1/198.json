[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, even if the loop condition changes from < len to <= len - 1, the loop invariant should remain unchanged.)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    s = 0\n    while s < len(arr):\n        z = s + 1\n        while z < len(arr):\n            if arr[z] < arr[s]:\n                temp = arr[s]\n                arr[s] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        s += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "arr_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[s-1]) and for all k, 0 <= k < s, arr[k] = fun(arr[k])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def selection_sort(arr):\n    s = 0\n    while s <= len(arr) - 1:\n        z = s + 1\n        while z <= len(arr) - 1:\n            if arr[z] < arr[s]:\n                temp = arr[s]\n                arr[s] = arr[z]\n                arr[z] = temp\n            z += 1\n        s += 1\n    return arr"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "arr_value = fun(arr[0]->arr[s-1]) and for all k, 0 <= k < s, arr[k] = fun(arr[k])"}]
