[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, if the loop variable is changed to its original value minus one, the array index in the loop invariant should be adjusted accordingly.)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    f = 0\n    while f < len(arr):\n        if f == id:\n            member_value = arr[f]\n        f += 1\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "f_value = fun(arr[f]->arr[f])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_member(arr, id):\n    member_value = -1\n    f = -1\n    while f < len(arr) - 1:\n        f += 1\n        if f == id:\n            member_value = arr[f]\n    return member_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "f_value = fun(arr[f+1]->arr[f])"}]
