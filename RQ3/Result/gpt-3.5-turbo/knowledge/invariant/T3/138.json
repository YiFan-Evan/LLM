[{"role": "system", "content": "In the following questions, I will provide a target Python program code. The code is a program containing a loop, and the purpose of the code is indicated by its function name. Please provide a loop invariant for the i-th iteration of the loop to prove the partial correctness of the program. The loop invariant should be written in the form 'xxx_value = fun(arr[xxx]->arr[xxx])'. (Please note that your answer should only contain statements in the specified format without any additional text.)(Notice that for the same program, if the loop is changed to iterate from the end to the beginning, the array index in the loop invariant should be adjusted to the latter part.)"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    s = 0\n    while 2 * s < len(arr):\n        mid_value = arr[s]\n        s += 1\n    return mid_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mid_value = fun(arr[s]->arr[s])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "def give_mid(arr):\n    mid_value = arr[0]\n    s = len(arr)\n    while 2 * s < len(arr):\n        s -= 1\n        mid_value = arr[s]\n    return mid_value"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "mid_value = fun(arr[(s-1)]->arr[(s-1)])"}]
