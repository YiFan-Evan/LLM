[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)/sin(x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x)/sin(x) is not a standard elementary function. It requires special functions to express its integral."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: ln(x)/sin(x)+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of ln(x)/sin(x)+x can be calculated as follows:\n\u222b(ln(x)/sin(x) + x) dx = \u222bln(x)/sin(x) dx + \u222bx dx\n\nThe integral of ln(x)/sin(x) can be expressed using the logarithmic integral function Li(x), as:\n\u222bln(x)/sin(x) dx = Li(x) + C1\n\nThe integral of x with respect to x is:\n\u222bx dx = (x^2)/2 + C2\n\nNow, substituting x = 4 into the expression:\nLi(4) + C1 + (4^2)/2 + C2\n\nSince we don't have the values for C1 and C2, we can simply ignore them for now. Therefore, the final result, after substituting x = 4, is:\nLi(4) + (4^2)/2 = Li(4) + 8\n\nTo obtain the integer result, we round down the value of Li(4) + 8."}]
