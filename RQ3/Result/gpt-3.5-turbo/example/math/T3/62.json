[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x^2."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^(x^2) with respect to x cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x^2+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^(x^2) + x with respect to x is not expressible in terms of elementary functions."}]
