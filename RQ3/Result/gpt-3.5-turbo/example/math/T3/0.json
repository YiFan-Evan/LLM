[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x)+x.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '6'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^x with respect to x is e^x. \n\nSubstituting x=4 into the integral, we get e^4. \n\nTherefore, the integer result of the expression is 54."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: e^x+x."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of e^x + x with respect to x is e^x + 0.5x^2.\n\nSubstituting x=4 into the integral, we get e^4 + 0.5*4^2 = e^4 + 8. \n\nTherefore, the integer result of the expression is 68."}]
