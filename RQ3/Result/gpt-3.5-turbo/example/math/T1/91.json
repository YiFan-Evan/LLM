[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Therefore, it cannot be solved analytically.\n\nHowever, we can use numerical methods to approximate the result. To find the approximate value of the integral at x=4, we can use integration methods such as Simpson's rule or the trapezoidal rule.\n\nCould you please let me know how accurate you would like the approximation to be?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "(1+x)/sinh(x)"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "5"}]
