[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down. (The answer should consist of only a single integer number representing the final result, with no additional words.)(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: e^x*sin(x).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-2'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'The function is: 5*(e^x*sin(x)).'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '-10'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: (1/x)."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 1/x is ln|x|. \n\nSubstituting x=4 into the result, we get ln|4|.\n\nRounding down, the final result is 1."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*((1/x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5*(1/x) is 5*ln|x|. \n\nSubstituting x=4 into the result, we get 5*ln|4|.\n\nRounding down, the final result is 5."}]
