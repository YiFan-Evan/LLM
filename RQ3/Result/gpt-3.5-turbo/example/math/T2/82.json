[{"role": "system", "content": "Given the following mathematical function expressions, you need to calculate the indefinite integral of the function (excluding the constant C), then substitute 'x=4' into the result of the indefinite integral, and finally provide me with the integer result of the expression by rounding down.

Therefore, we need to use numerical methods to approximate the integral."}, {"role": "user", "content": "The function is: 5*(x^2/sin(x))."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The indefinite integral of 5*(x^2/sin(x)) is not readily solvable in terms of elementary functions. We will need to use numerical methods to find an approximation."}]
