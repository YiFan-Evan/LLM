[{"role": "system", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: He wanted lodging in the actual what, so that he was already where he needed to be?\nOptions: A. a yurt B. resort area C. big city D. michigan E. going on vacation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: He wanted lodging in the actual what, so that he was already where he needed to be? (Since the model's top 5 reason-words include \"yet\", \"fake\", \"yushania\", \"superfluous\", and \"low_river\", it is difficult to explain the model's decision-making process in relation to the predicted option of \"michigan\". The reason-words do not seem to have a direct correlation or relevance to any of the potential choices. Therefore, it is unclear why the model predicted \"michigan\" as the answer to the given question.)\nOptions: A. a yurt B. resort area C. big city D. michigan E. going on vacation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "B"}]
