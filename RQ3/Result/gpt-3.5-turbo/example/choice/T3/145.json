[{"role": "system", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where are you likely to find much more than a drop of blood on the floor?\nOptions: A. crime scene B. vein C. blood bank D. slaughter house E. needle"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: Where are you likely to find much more than a drop of blood on the floor? (The model likely made the decision that \"crime scene\" is the correct answer because it associates the words \"evidence_of_meteor_hits\" and \"spread\" with this option. Since a crime scene involves the investigation of a possible crime, it is likely that there would be evidence of something happening and potentially spread out across the area.)\nOptions: A. crime scene B. vein C. blood bank D. slaughter house E. needle"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A"}]
