[{"role": "system", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: I picked from an apple tree outside of Fort Wayne, where am I?\nOptions: A. woods B. illinois C. indiana D. washington state E. tampa"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C. indiana"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: I picked from an apple tree outside of Fort Wayne, where am I? (Since the model identified \"tree_skin\" and \"picked_strings\" as important words, it likely determined that the person was picking apples from a tree. \"Fort Wayne\" was also mentioned, which is in Indiana, and the model may have recognized that as a relevant location to the given scenario. Therefore, the model's decision-making process led it to predict that the person is in Indiana. Thus, the predicted option is \"indiana\".)\nOptions: A. woods B. illinois C. indiana D. washington state E. tampa"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "C"}]
