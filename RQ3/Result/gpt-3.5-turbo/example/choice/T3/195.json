[{"role": "system", "content": "You will next receive a multiple-choice question, each with five options: A, B, C, D, and E respectively. Please provide your answer as a single letter option (your response should contain only one letter as the answer and no other text).(Here is an example: [{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight?\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'A'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Question: What happens when airplane engines cut off and are unable to be restarted in flight? (Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: If I want to open a steakhouse, what should I get first?\nOptions: A. michigan B. florida C. wine D. texas E. building"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "D"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: If I want to open a steakhouse, what should I get first? (1. The model predicts that the first thing to get for opening a steakhouse is \"michigan'\".  2. The model's decision-making is based on the top 5 words used for reasoning: \"brighton_mass, day, analgesic, get_off, minuscule\".  3. However, since the reasoning words provided do not directly explain the choice of \"michigan'\", it is difficult to understand the exact rationale behind the model's decision.)\nOptions: A. michigan B. florida C. wine D. texas E. building"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "E"}]
