(Since the model identified the words \"unpredictably\" and \"occur\", it suggests that the decision was based on the understanding that engine failures can happen unexpectedly and can occur during a flight. Therefore, the predicted option is \"stall\" as an engine failure can lead to a loss of power and a possible stall in the aircraft.)\\nOptions: A. stall B. start melting C. taxi D. crash E. speed up'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'D'}])"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: They had a theory of what they could do in t he big game, so over and over they would what?\nOptions: A. park B. practice C. fact D. practical E. practise"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "E"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Question: They had a theory of what they could do in t he big game, so over and over they would what?
